<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  ...1 got into a lot of trouble because I got 1n a lot of fights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Because I was so often called names. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Christkiller and especially, you see in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the profession of your father follows you. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">So any time you started a new class and the teacher would call the roll. "</span><span class="sentence" id="4">Your's father's name, religion, profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">What do you manufacture?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="6">He manufactures matzahs." </span><span class="sentence" id="7">So it didn't last very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And I got into trouble, and got into fights, through the old blood libel. "</span><span class="sentence" id="9">Your father kills Christian babies for Passover!" </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I experienced that quite often.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Do you remember the first time that happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  I think it might have been--I might be off about a year--the second or third year, the second or third grade, possibly. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I must have been around 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 years old; 10 years old, that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So it was already before '33, because I think I was 12 years old in 1933 when Hitler came to power.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  About Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  No, can you tell me about your first realization, the first time you recalled being associated as a Christkiller?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  I cannot remember the distinct incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">All I know, the things usually happened during recess. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was Gaudic (ph) School. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Yes, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="23"><span class="BUILDING">Gaudic School</span> was the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And during recess, I was out with the other boys; and somebody starts the trouble, and starts calling you that. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And I was very feisty. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And as soon as somebody started calling me names, I was swinging. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And there were bloody noses. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">The next thing happened, I was in the <span class="BUILDING">principal's office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Then my parents were called. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">That happened so often, I don't know anymore when the first time was. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And my grades suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And I refused to do school work. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And then my parents were called. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And the teachers and the principal said, in German, ao (ph)."" </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I cannot translate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">He is telling it; but lazy beyond, because I refused to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I refused to. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">It became later, of course, even more pronounced after the Hitler period. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">When we had the assembly. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We had to stand at attention and salute the flag and sing the Horst Wessel song. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I tried not to raise my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And this led to complications and problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Then I was forced to. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It sometimes reminds me today, when I saw the conditions, when we are also forced to go through certain procedures.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  When you faced insults at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , did you try to bring the subject up with your parents or with your sister, for example? </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Did you ever talk to them about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Or did you keep it to yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="48">How were these matters touched on at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or weren't they touched on at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  I think early on I must have mentioned something to my sister; but I learned early on that this was a part of growing up as a Jew and in a <span class="REGION">European country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">In a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that has seen anti- Semitism forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So it was all part of it, and you learn it, and I was not surprised by it anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Your father, I believe, was a World War I veteran. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">How did he feel about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and how did he feel about things like this? </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Did he ever talk about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  I don't remember talking to my father about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I might have, but I don't remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">You see, until very recently, until about a year ago, I had a total memory block. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And I went to several psychiatrists and psychologists in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Indianapolis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I didn't...when we were negotiating with the <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> government for restitution, loss of property, loss of education, and all that, I could not fill in all the lengthy questionnaires that I was sent by the German government; because I didn't remember the name of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I attended, I didn't remember the name of the <span class="DLF">street</span> I lived on. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And if it wouldn't have been followed by a brother, I wouldn't have got a penny. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">About a year ago, I started writing about it and things started coming back more and more, but there is still some, some <span class="DLF">blocks</span> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Can you remember the very first time you ever heard about Hitler, not necessarily 1933? </span><span class="sentence" id="64">What did he mean to you very early on as a child? </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Was it ever discussed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or amongst your friends or other Jewish families that you knew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Well, all I can tell you is that--(cough) excuse me--I should proceed that by saying that I considered myself almost a German, foremost. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I had heard about Zionism, and we negated it. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I was a German of the Jewish faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So were my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">As you said, my father was a veteran of World War I. And when we heard about the Nazis, it was a passing political phenomena. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Like many policies. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I do remember once, I don't know when it was, some bloody street fights between a communist and the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I do remember as if it was some sort of pin (ph); and several of my friends, maybe my parents, belonged to the SDP (Social Democratic Party) , which was a majority party, sent____——————.—«sAnd others wore the Nazi emblem, the Communist emblem, and more than once, I saw the street flights that really were something to behold as far as violence 1s concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Nothing to compare with today, unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">But, 1t was just another party that came into power. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I think the Jews by in large were perhaps divided into two camps - the pessimists and the optimists. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">There were some pessimists that picked up and left in the '30's. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">All our friends, my families, relatives, couldn't even conceive of leaving in the mid '30's. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Everybody lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Your parents lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Your grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Been there for generations who had a vital business. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Why would anybody seriously consider leaving? </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And the Nazis developed their methods so slowly, very slowly, that at least from my perspective, whatever little I remember, there was no forewarning of what was to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We look at it today with the perspective of hindsight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  When did it first impinge on you? </span><span class="sentence" id="88">When did you first yourself notice the Nazis or feel that maybe the Nazis were affecting you. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Not the street fights? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But you yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  I think that was the outgrowth of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> ...the Nuremberg Laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  It would help me considerably, rather than just answering my question, if you could say something like, "I remember this for me started in Europe."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Okay, I think it was...I remember it when I was told I could no longer do certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I could no longer participate in sports, contact sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Uh, soccor. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I could no longer participate, unless the ski team--I did considerable ski racing; slalom and long distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I could... It really hit me I wanted to go to the <span class="BUILDING">opera</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I was no longer permitted to go to the <span class="BUILDING">opera</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I saw the sign "Jews are Forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Prohibited to Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Wherever we went, we saw more and more of the signs. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">That is when it really hit me that I was not just a German of the Jewish religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Which, until that period, it really hadn't sunk in. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But then it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So it was in the mid '30's that I realized that the vise had tightened a little bit, and we were made to stand out and we were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And made to suffer for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Were you made to feel different in the <span class="DLF">street</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">You weren't allowed to go, how did people respond to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Did you find it on a personal level that things were changing? </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Tell me something about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Well, on a personal level, I felt it in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and in sports and when you wanted to participate in certain public events. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So many <span class="REGION">areas</span> were restricted. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I think that 1s the only way I can remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I was still active in a very disciplined, highly disciplined, semi-militaristic youth organization, Jewish youth organization by the name of Scwartzefahnlein--Black Pennant [Ger: "Black Squad"]. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I joined it when I was about 8 and one half years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And as I said, it was a rather militaristic pseudo-scouting organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And this is when I had really my best times. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I enjoyed life tremendously. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And I have many, some fond memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">In retrospect, I am surprised that my parents let me go on a 6 weeks hike when I was 8 and one half years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It was compared to scouting standards, very tough, just to get to scout. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I believe I was let loose in the middle of of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> at night, and find your way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">This sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And we tramped...hiked all of the way from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> [Pol: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wroc_aw</span> ] north to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Baltic Sea</span> , then took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freighter</span> around to bypass a <span class="DLF">Polish corridor</span> , to the lake area of east of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> --as the Polish called it--and hiked to an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> where we stayed for 4 weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  This was a Jewish youth organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Did you have any non-Jewish friends at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Did they change at the time of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , or didn't you have any non-Jewish friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  I am glad you asked that. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I did have non-Jewish friends, up to about '35. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">After that, I was absolutely ostracized. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I lost all friends I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I did not exist anymore for my non-Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">They wouldn't dare to be seen with a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Did they say anything to you at all? </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Did anybody ever apologize for the change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Did you try to make contact with them or did you retreat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  Well, I guess in the beginning you walked up to a boy and tried to talk to him like you always did. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And you were left standing when he turned around and walked away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  After '35, were you still ? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Did you have to give you name, and who you were, and what your father did? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Was there any change in response then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">You see, <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> was very disciplined as it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">and I don't when that incident happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">But to give an example, I don't know it was regular behavior, corporal punishment, I was very good in <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">As a gymnast. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And we once did a formation in calisthenics. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">It was new to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And I was bad to the kid next to me and watched what it was going to be when it was finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And the teacher heard it, he walked up to me, and slapped my face and I wound up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and I think that's when, perhaps, my hearing suffered somewhat. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">It is this sort of aggressive behavior by some teachers, was made perhaps more ageressive later than in the beginning, but quite frankly I don't remember exactly what happened where, when.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  When did you family start to talk about the changed situation after 1935? </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Or did they talk? </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Was it an unmentioned subject? </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Did life just carry on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  Life carried on. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">You have to carry on. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And especially on adverse conditions, you carry on. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We talked about it occasionally, yes; especially since we had the <span class="BUILDING">matzah factory</span> , which was bolaba (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Now it was like many <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Not visible on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Many <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> in Europe were in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> behind the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , which was closed off with a <span class="DLF">iron gate</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">You had to have access to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And then you go through the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was behind it. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So it was only those people that knew; but occasionally there was some vandalism. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But not much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Surprisingly, my father, as I said, was a very nice, easy-going, mild- mannered man, who helped a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">The factory workers that lived in the <span class="BUILDING">tenement houses</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> that we owned in front of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , they adored him. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">They would do anything for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">He always helped them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Give them money. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So he never had any problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Not even at Kristallnacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Do you think his German workers felt okay about him being Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Or were most of the workers Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Or were they Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  All Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But I guess it was perhaps their livelihoods that they perhaps protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything special about... Do you remember... You said you were interested in <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Do you remember the Olympic games? </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Do you remember thinking anything about the Olympic games?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I heard about it from my wife cause she was a swimmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And she is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And they wanted...she also was not permitted anymore on a swim team. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But they lived close to a <span class="BUILDING">Olympic stadium</span> , and she told me about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  Let's move on now a couple of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Let's move on to just before Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">How were things changed from '35 to '38, as far as you were concerned? </span><span class="sentence" id="199">You were now a young man, 12 or 13?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Well, it was about when I was 14 years old, things got very bad in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I remember the principal coming in once and said, "We don't want the Jew Heppner in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Out!" </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So I left <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">When I was 14 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I am a kick-out. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I took some classes in <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , whatever; and then my mother knew somebody who owned a <span class="DLF">machine yard</span> --industrial machinery, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span> , like all the steam equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And everybody at that time learned a practical craft, in preparation for possible immigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And I was good with my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I am almost ambidextrous. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Actually, when I was left handed, I was forced to learn my writing with my right hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So I took several courses. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I learned welding, I learned locksmithing, I learned out to pick locks, and then I became a volunteer, ___(ph), that is the name for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Not an apprentice, but as an apprentice with minimal pay; because we didn't need the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">My parents knew the owner. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So I was working there in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , welding and cutting and working in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I knew how to type. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I maintained the petty cash. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They had a <span class="BUILDING">gas station</span> ; pumped gas, and learned all kind of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">One interesting experience I remember, after I took the course in welding, it was a fairly warm August day, I was asked to cut, with a torch, heavy steam piping. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And I took the torch and I didn't have my overhauls and I cut off the umbrella bags, put them around my waist, took a piece of wire and fastened it, and another fella helped me turn the heavy piping while I was cutting away. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And I smelled some smoke and the flames started shooting up and ignited the umbrella bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">But I had learned what to do, and I hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and rolled and just lost some of my sweater and shirt and eyebrows and hair.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  Were your fellow workers Jewish or German or German-Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">ANSWER:  The foreman of the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , the yard foreman, was an SA man, Brown Shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Was an everyday German. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Very business-like. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Around the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">No problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I never knew if he was one of those that were more or less voluntarily had entered the Brownshirts, or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Incidentally, later, Kristallnacht, he did not... Well, I will get to that later, perhaps.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  Let's maybe move forward to Kristallnacht itself and the staff report. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Take me back and set the scene for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  This is the period that I really vividly remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Of course, 1t was before the time of the jet age, before the time of instant news. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We had to go to the movies, 1f we could go to the movies, and see the weekly news. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I do remember we had a radio at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , a Blaupunkt, with a loud speaker which was fairly new and there were antennas in the form of spools and you had to carefully tune them to get a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So getting news was not as easy as it was today. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">There was some rumors then, just about that time, after from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radnow</span> (ph) or vom Rath' was assassinated, that the Nazis might look for a way to punish the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Something was expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We just didn't know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And I know the night before, or during the night perhaps, I don't know when it was, I heard later in the morning my father he was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">He had received a call from one of the factory workers to come to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">There was trouble there. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Come to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and close it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And I was at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">My brother by that time was married and lived someplace else with his wife and a little baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And I heard some noise out front. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">We lived in a residential area in one of these big <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Most middle class people, even the affluent ones, didn't own <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> unless they had a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Large <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">We lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And I looked out and I saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> come up the <span class="DLF">street</span> with SS troops, stop at one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I was watching. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Go in and come out a few minutes later with some of our Jewish neighbors and push them up in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Next <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Then they came across to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I didn't wait for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I ran to the <span class="INT_SPACE">back room</span> , jumped out the <span class="DLF">window</span> , got on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , got away. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Then I was running around aimlessly for awhile and I was afraid of the <span class="DLF">road block</span> and I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steam car</span> , want to see what is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Where am I going to go now, where am I going to hid? </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So I got off. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I want to see what is happening <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I was very adventure-some. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">That was my scouting nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I did some crazy things. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So I got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> and I could see the smoke from a distance already. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Leaned out, I was standing on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I could see smoke and came to the name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I can't remember the name, and I saw the flames shooting out of the dome of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I was just furious. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">That affected me more than perhaps anything else in all these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">But I remember next to me stood an old German woman and she muttered to herself, translated into English, "Oh, what a shame. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">What a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that was." </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Next to us stood a Nazi in civics and not in uniform and he reached and pulled the cord, brought the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to a stop, yanked her out just for that remark. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Time went on and until I got close I decided from there on I am going to go to where I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">That was a pretty big <span class="DLF">yard</span> and I figured of all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> , this is perhaps fairly safe and I can hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I used to be inside <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steam boilers</span> , you know, cleaning them and so I figured nobody is going to find me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And I got there and I came through the <span class="DLF">back entrance</span> somehow and I saw Herr Mischelson (ph) the owner, Jewish, a friend of my mother and they had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> right over the <span class="BUILDING">office building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And he was walking along with a cigar. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I said, gee, that is strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Here they round up Jews and business as usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So I thought I got to go in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So I waited a moment and watched and there is a yard man, in uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Business as usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">He didn't turn him in. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">This was an industrial complex, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And it was actually as I remembered there was an SS at the roundups and the SA was ' Ernst vom Rath was a German diplomat assassinated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> by Hershel Grynszpan on November 7, 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">involved in the night before, busting up the <span class="DLF">shop windows</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So, he didn't turn him in. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">but I didn't trust the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I didn't know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So, I stayed out of sight until evening and then made my way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">In the meanwhile, my father was at the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and stayed in hiding until the next night too by one of his workers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION:  You say the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorrie</span> drove up. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">What sort of <span class="DLF">street</span> was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Who were the men inside it? </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Were they young? </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Were they old? </span><span class="sentence" id="300">How were they carrying on? </span><span class="sentence" id="301">What sort of <span class="DLF">street</span> does a Jew live on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  I think the name was Wolfestrasse (ph).” </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And it was a residential area. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And I presume, it was a mixed neighborhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">There were no really Jewish areas, as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">But I think most Jews belong to what you would call the middle class. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Quite a few lived 1n an <span class="REGION">area</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">The general area, in a <span class="REGION">south area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  Did you recognize any of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  As neighbors, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I neglected to tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Before I went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> I decided to go to my brother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I got to my brother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and there was my sister-in-law with the baby just about in tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">What had happened (end of tape this side) (phrases missing). </span><span class="sentence" id="316">There were quite a few men around there that had heard what happened the night before, and they thought of maybe going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> or another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">They couldn't conceive that it had happened all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It was you would have thought an isolated incident there, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">We didn't know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So we thought of maybe hiding temporarily, but where. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So we decided, well, to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> first and pack a suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But then of course they find out, you know, you can't go in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So all he could do was call up and report and next morning the policemen came and escorted him to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> where he found a whole group of other men under the same conditions and then they were marched through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> with all the German folk standing by and hooting and hollering and seeing in the opening what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">QUESTION:  Did you see the schelshon (ph)? </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Did you see these people being marched off? </span><span class="sentence" id="326">What was happening to you that day? </span><span class="sentence" id="327">A. I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">That was the day, wait a minute, that was the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Nothing anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">This roundup was primarily only this one day if I remember right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  Were you back at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  Let me take you back just a little bit more? </span><span class="sentence" id="335">You say you decided to go to your brother and your sister-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Set the scene for me, as you went up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> or into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">What was the situation? </span><span class="sentence" id="338">How were you admitted? </span><span class="sentence" id="339">What did it look like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">ANSWER:  I think it was just a mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">It was an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">A modern <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And, if I remember right, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was just torn up. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">The way it would look, you know, if you had burglars, I would think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  How frightened was your sister-in-law? </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Did she let you in easily? </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Where was the baby?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  I don't know, it was... I see it, but I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">It was in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> , in her arm at one time, earlier or later. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I really can't reconstruct it. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">It is just too long ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Some things stand in my mind; like I remember there was a scene of fire shooting out of the skeleton, what was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I made a vow then. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I was so furious and so hateful already. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I vowed at that time I was going to fight those bastards whenever and wherever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  Were the people standing around watching? </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Was the fire brigade there or was it just burning? </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Just tell me a little bit more about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">ANSWER:  I didn't see too much; because it was a side <span class="DLF">street</span> , you see, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going at right angle to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So I saw the outline of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , the great <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> where we went to services. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And it was a huge <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , like a <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">It was a dome. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And I just saw it for a fraction of a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I think that the fire brigade was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">You have to protect burning <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> at least, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">It was one of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that was not in the <span class="DLF">back yard</span> , but was out in the open, incidently. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">It was a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Red brick building.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">QUESTION:  What happened to your father? </span><span class="sentence" id="370">You and your father weren't rounded up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">As far as I remember, this roundup was only very...just this one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">My father never was caught, and I wasn't caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">It's too big, what happened then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  What about your brother? </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Was your father there? </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Did you know what was happening with your brother? </span><span class="sentence" id="379">How did you find out all of that? </span><span class="sentence" id="380">How did the family respond and how did you respond?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  Well, I am trying to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">We had a get-together...we had a get-together in the evening, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">My mother and my father were not on best terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">As a matter of fact, they were separated, but together again. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And eventually divorced, for practical reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">The only thing I do remember is that Kristallnacht was the turning point. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">That was the time when we knew that this was for real. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">No more optimism left. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">All this time before, we were questioning, "How do we get out?" </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And I think it is all important. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">You know, I get asked so often: "Why was it so difficult to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And I tell everybody, "It is not getting out. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">It was a question that no <span class="REGION">county</span> would let you in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">QUESTION:  Tell me, if you can, can you see the scene that evening? </span><span class="sentence" id="396">What was the discussion? </span><span class="sentence" id="397">You said this was the end of optimism. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Tell me, can you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  Where are we going to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="400">That followed after the conference of Evian, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Where are we going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I know that my brother had contacts with some <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> I think in <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Get visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Fortunately, he had some papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And we found out, I don't know exactly when, that the Gestapo made it clear that anyone that would prove to them that they would leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> within a specified time, they would be released from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">There was a second reason, also, how you could get released. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I don't know if it is pertinent now. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I think a title, our house title was already sold by that time, sold forcibly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  What do you mean by that, <span class="BUILDING">house</span> sold forcibly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  We had to sell it to Aryans. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">It has just come back to me that earlier, sometime in the '30's, Jews were forced to inventory all their belongings, assets, everything they owned, jewelry, and property was sold for a pittance. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Our real estate was sold for a pittance. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Our _____ title was sold. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">We had no say and somebody that wanted it could buy it for next to nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  I don't understand you. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">How were you forced to sell? </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Did someone come along and say to you, sell it, or were you hard up? </span><span class="sentence" id="418">You say you were forced to sell.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">ANSWER:  Well, I am trying to think because my parents were involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Not I, personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">The way I think it worked, I vaguely remember now, if a Jew owned a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , a business, and his competitor I'd say, or anyone, would say I would like to have it, I would like to own it, could merely go to the police and say I want to buy that from that Jew, and the price was set, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Now if that Jew was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">--Buchenwald</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> --and the Christian buyer was fairly decent and didn't know how to run the business that he just acquired from the Jew; and the wife, let's say, came to him and said, "Do you need some help running it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Or the fact is the Jew was helping him run the business, which he was required to do, then the Gestapo would immediately discharge him. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">But most of them was...could get out of the camp if the wife, daughter, whoever went to the Gestapo with proof. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">This was a crucial period.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  You say your brother was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Did you see him? </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Tell me how did that affect the family, his actual arrest and departure? </span><span class="sentence" id="429">What flowed from that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  Well, we heard it from my sister-in-law and that 1s all I do know. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Because, well, I was so fairly young and I was very concerned about at once things. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And I didn't have much contact with my brother, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">TAPE #2 TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
QUESTION:  Let's just take ourselves back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">You say that you heard your brother was away and you started to talk about things. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">When did your brother, did you see your brother again, did he come out after?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Yes, fortunately, he had some negotiations with, I believe, the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I understand that many of the <span class="BUILDING">consulates</span> took money under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and sold visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">One of the problems was that our bank account were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">It didn't matter how much money you owned, you could not get it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> would give you sufficient money to live on, for daily necessities and for anything connected with emigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I got, for instance, my ticket-- steamer tickets, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Train tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But not sufficient money to buy a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">But my sister-in-law, I believe, had a...what I would call a "letter of intent," saying that they're working on a visa, that most likely you would get the visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So with that, she went to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> , and was told, "Um, yes, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">We will investigate, and he will be set free." </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So I heard indirectly that one day, that he, like many others, a loud speaker... He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">A loud speaker said ...called out the name of the Jews there to come to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And certain procedures were followed; and they were given even money and a train ticket, and they were sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Ironically, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> nearest to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> , which I had I think had some connection with the...that's where the Weimar Republic was formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">He had survived the winter, which was cold; but since he only reported next morning, he was dressed warmly. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So he didn't suffer the same fate as some others, you know, that didn't survive the harsh German winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">He would never talk about his experience there. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">He said he couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">All I know next was that we set around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> to decide what to do now. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I understand there was a time limit. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">What my brother and sister tried to do, they took a course...had taken a course, at one time--or maybe only afterwards, I don't remember--as butler and maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Because they tried to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And I understand <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> needed domestic help. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So my sister-in-law--which I believe has never been in a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , because she didn't even know how to cook an egg, because we had servants, you know--and so I found out later on, they went out to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on some <span class="REGION">estate</span> that was owned by Jews who very rapidly found out that my brother was no butler. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">He learned how to pour the white wine and red wine; but my sister-in-law couldn't cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But they helped them along and got some other job for them; until, unfortunately, my brother was then interned by <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> for being a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">As you know, one of the other ironies of politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">But I think the main thing that happened then... In 1978, I believe it was...

<p><span class="sentence" id="468">ANSWER:  '78. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">NBC had a document|ary] drama on the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And I saw a preview; and I saw the family--Wiess or Weiss--sitting around a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> there trying to figure out what next, how to get out, and what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I saw the scene; and something bothered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And I said, "Gee, that is...1s so familiar. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And yet there 1s something strange that isn't nght." </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Something was basically wrong with that scene, but I couldn't make out. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">But I remembered, "My God! </span><span class="sentence" id="477">That it is what happened at our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> !" </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And I woke up the next night, and remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">It was exactly what happened at our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , except it was in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">On the NBC documentary, it was in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I remember the scene in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I was sitting around. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And by that time, there were rumors floating around that there was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> --which is the other end of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">At that time, farther than the...perhaps, Mars today. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Or perhaps the moon. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">There was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> that did not require a visa, and Jews could go there without a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">It was unheard of. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So my mother, who was very good business woman, she said she would investigate. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Then I think they contacted some of the Jewish organizations; and the Jewish organizations said, "Yes, you can go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">But don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">It is an awful <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">We would not recommend anyone to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">That's the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">There is a war raging there, and you don't know if you would even be permitted to land there. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">All kind of rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And just don't." </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So my mother went to a travel agent. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And she heard: "Yes, you can go there by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And it takes about four weeks to go there, on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luxury liner</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Yeah, but the waiting list is 6 to 8 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">10 months." </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So my mother said, "You know, there must be some way of getting there faster." </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So my mother did...the travel agent had helped my mother several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And she said, "You own some Impressionistic paintings, don't you? </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Well, the agent...I happen to know the agent of the Nord Deutsche Lon, the official German Steamship Agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">He is a collector." </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So it wasn't long afterwards we start to make the preparations. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">We already...I have a copy of a letter to the Gestapo to give us preference in getting all the stuff out. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">You know, you had to list and inventory how many shirts, how many shoes, how many socks--everything had to be listed. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Get everything in preparation done. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And my parents, my sister and brother... And my mother and I were supposed to try, at least, first to go out; and they would follow. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Perhaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">My sister--by that time, as I said, she was very severely handicapped--had found a man that was also handicapped; and the two kept company. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">So she didn't want to leave him immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And my father still had to wind up some business. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">My brother was trying to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So it was decided my mother and I was supposed to go first. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We get a call. "</span><span class="sentence" id="519">Everything is ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Can you leave in 48 hours?" </span><span class="sentence" id="521">A couple onboard the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potsdam</span> , or going on board, or before they boarded--I am not sure which--leaving the port of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">They couldn't face it. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">liner</span> left with an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">My mother and I got the Customs people over, or what the... They had to come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and seal our bags, inspect them and seal them. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">We took the night express to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  No goodbyes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  Yes, there were goodbyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Yes, I said goodbye to my father and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And I knew that I would never see them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">My brother took us to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Yah, I knew it then. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">They said, "Aufwiedersehen;" but I knew we would never seem them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I got a very severe nosebleed that couldn't be stopped when I said goodbye to my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I plugged it up, because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> was waiting and we didn't want to miss the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So then we got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innsbruck</span> , and looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> ; and there were the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> right and left of the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , beautiful...<span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And then we knew on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> is <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">We got to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zolle</span> --you know, Customs. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Oh, before that, my mother and I were talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And she confided in me that she took a second watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">We were permitted one ring, one watch--everything strictly regulated. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And although I was quite...well, easy- going and adventure-some, when I heard that she had an extra watch, I just threw a fit in that <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">There was another fellow sitting there, who was also heading to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> I found out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And I made her give me the thing; and before we got to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , I got out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> , went to a <span class="DLF">mailbox</span> and threw the watch into the <span class="DLF">mailbox</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And she loved that watch, and she didn't want to give it up; but I made her. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I knew what would have happened if they would have found a second watch, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">We would have headed back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And a good thing we did, because when we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> , the control [NB: Customs] went through: "Alle Juden, Raus!" </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Every Jew had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And with our baggage and everything, out. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And so they started examining... Now, the baggage was sealed, fortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">So they strip-searched us; and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went on, without us. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">After we were through, we had to wait for the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> --which was one of these...not an express, but one of the slow pokes, you know, that stops at every <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Genoa</span> --called Genoa?--fairly late at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Couldn't board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and boarded the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And we realized, "My God!" </span><span class="sentence" id="557">We had the two suitcases each, and each of us had 10 marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Twenty marks between us. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">The total of eight American dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Four dollars each. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And all of a sudden, it overcame us. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">You know, all of a sudden... All my life, I [had] never worried about money. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And my mother always played the grand dame. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">You know, she [was] fairly well off. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And uh, you know, travelled widely, and um always had a fairly good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And all of a sudden, we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and we realized we had no money on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Do we have enough money for a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="568">You know, we lived from one day to the next. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Well, we found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay [for] one night. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">We were lying in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> ; and all of a sudden, an earthquake struck. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">We didn't know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">We're both sitting in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and trying to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Uh, was a strange experience, for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And uh next morning, we...
QUESTION:  What was a strange experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  The earthquake! </span><span class="sentence" id="576">The earth was shaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">That's why I remember that particular night. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And uh next morning, we boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Potsdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">The <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> was not first class, but was touristic-second class. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">But it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luxury liner</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">As we have cruises today in the old tradition and the young tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">With a menu that long, and service as it is supposed to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">We enjoyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Carefree days... We had "board" money. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">The <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> had deposited a certain amount, because it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Deposited--I forgot how much. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">We had four dollars; but we could buy several hundred marks worth--maybe even more--of anything in the <span class="BUILDING">ship's store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">The first thing, I bought a camera. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I think it was a Leica. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I bought a very good camera with the rest of that money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">QUESTION:  Tell me about the other passengers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">ANSWER:  Well, there was only one passenger I do remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">There was another young man about my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I have seen maybe a picture of him, but I forget his name and I don't know who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And I have never run into him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I lost track of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">But there was one gentleman, extremely well dressed, who was sitting in our <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> who also went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">He was very flamboyantly dressed, with wife and child Zahlinger (ph) was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I do remember it, because he opened a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> later in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and I worked for him for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">That is one of the passengers that I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  What was the mood on the...on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Was the mood cheerful?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">ANSWER:  Well, it was a mixture of cheerful... You know, you really couldn't worry much because, first of all, we had to pay out our ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I still have a copy of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">We had to pay for a return trip, because we did not know we were permitted to land in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So you would try not to think of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">We knew there was nobody there; we didn't know anybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">We didn't know the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I did not know the difference between Y-E-S and N-O. I literally did not speak a single word of English. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I had some <span class="BUILDING">Latin school</span> , which started in the fifth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I had a little bit of French. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">We got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Said</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="614">We had our first experience with Jewish organizations; because the British tried to prevent us from going ashore. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">God forbid we might stay! </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I got ashore. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And uh walked around the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">A couple of Arabs approached me, tried to sell me dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I had no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Cigarettes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So I traded my German cigarettes for dates, which I love. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And then there were a couple of Jews--uh met us and asked us to come with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And they guided us to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and took us upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">It was so ramshackle that I was afraid the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> would fall down. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And I remember walking up a little <span class="DLF">stairway</span> into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and there was spread out clothing. "</span><span class="sentence" id="626">If you need any clothing..." And you know, I just couldn't comprehend it. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Why would I need used clothing? </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Not realizing that there are ...were some people who got out with even less than I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">So we had a fairly carefree time. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">We got to the rest of the <span class="DLF">ports</span> ; sail on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Singapore</span> , beautiful <span class="DLF">harbor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Singapore</span> , we're also met by Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">The same difficulties with the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">But we had a valid passport, and they really couldn't make a distinction and prevent us from going ashore. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> went over [to] <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kobe</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , where we spent a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And then came a day when we steamed to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Uh, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was...waited for a high tide in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Yangtze</span> [NB: Chang Jiang] ____, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Yangtze River</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Then we slowly steamed into the...a tributary, the Huang- p'u [Also: <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Huangpu</span> or Wangpoo] [River]. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And I remember we were all up on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> and we looked out at the right side, starboard. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And we saw nothing but desolation. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">What we saw, without knowing it, was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hongkou</span> [NB: Hongkew] of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> --where we would actually live later. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">But when we saw it, I think everybody was just awestruck. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">It was quite... You could see the desolation, or <span class="BUILDING">ruins</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">At that time, nobody had seen desolation of that type. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Burned out <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">We saw some wharfs that were sticking up. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">For some reasons, the wharfs were there along the <span class="DLF">waterfront</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And then we came slowly to the <span class="DLF">Bund</span> , the waterfront of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And nobody even noticed the beautiful big <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> there and what's going to happen there. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">We had thought of <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> --you know, typical <span class="BUILDING">Chinese buildings</span> , upturned roofs, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="650"><span class="BUILDING">Philippine buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651"><span class="BUILDING">Office buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Except for this section that we were seeing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And which was, I don't know what to call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">It was very demoralizing perhaps, seeing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">This was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And we came; and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> couldn't get to Jack (ph) Quay. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">We were afraid to go over and the lighter in the launch. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">When you get >in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , the noise hits you. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And I can still smell the street vendors and the peanut oil. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And it wasn't...the heat hadn't started yet, because it was March...March '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">So it wasn't...the heat wasn't so bad as it was later. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And then our suitcases came. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And what bothered...what struck us most was, there was some representatives of a committee there, greeting us. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And uh...
QUESTION:  What sort of committee?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">ANSWER:  Well, one of the committees that had sprung up to assist the refugees that were arriving there. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">It was formed by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> --the Jews there, the Jews that had lived there already. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">There was some Jews living there from the Bolshevik Revolution, and some Sephardic Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> --the Sassoons and the Hardoons--and some of the others, that had organized some committees to help the arriving Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And we were just through--no customs, no nothing, no visa, no passport control. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Just was, then. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And we were told we would be taken to a <span class="BUILDING">reception center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And we came outside the <span class="DLF">jetty</span> there; and we already got some quick warnings. "</span><span class="sentence" id="674">Don't do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Don't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Hold on to your pocketbook. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Hold onto your money." </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And a whole list of don'ts. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And uh there is a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="680">Will you get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , please." </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And I found out later, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">There is usually not much cattle in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">It's pigs. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">So we walked up that plank, on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And it is quite a sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I have a photograph of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Well dressed Europeans walking up on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle truck</span> , standing up there, through the narrow <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and taken to the <span class="BUILDING">Embankment Building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Which was <span class="BUILDING">office building</span> belonging to [Sir Victor] Sassoon; which he had made a couple of floors available, which were hastily converted to <span class="INT_SPACE">receptionist area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So that's where there was a kind of <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And I was...we landed, incidently, and we had about 75 cents left among us--my Mom and I--in American money. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Which went a long way in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">QUESTION:  How did you expect to live, with 75 cents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">ANSWER:  We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">When we got there... And before that, we did not know who would greet us, if somebody would meet us, if we would have <span class="DLF">roof</span> over our heads the next day, if we would have something to eat the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">We knew nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">We heard some rumors: yes, there was some Jews and there would be somebody, hopefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">We also...we didn't know if there was still fighting, if we would be able to land. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">We didn't hear anything from the <span class="DLF">steamship line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">They didn't make any announcements. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">We knew nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">At least, I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Maybe some others knew more. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">QUESTION:  So what happened when you got to the <span class="BUILDING">reception center</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">ANSWER:  Well, I got some soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And I was very spoiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">You see, we had one cooks in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> ; obviously, we had cooks. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I wanted a cook, I wanted this, and I don't like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And I was really a spoiled brat. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And I got a bowl of soup there that I couldn't get it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And I know I took something of the 75 cents and went and bought a candy bar. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I learned the hard way. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I had to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I learned it, but it wasn't easy for a spoiled brat like me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">QUESTION:  What did you go to then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">ANSWER:  Uh, well, we stayed there for about 2 weeks in this <span class="BUILDING">reception center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And my mother is very resourceful, as I said earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">She met the director of the one of the youth committees that had sprung up. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And found a job, very rapidly. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">They needed some help. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">There were no social workers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">So she said she can do this, she can do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And I guess I learned this from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I bluffed my way through everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And so she got a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , money...it doesn't take much. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">You know, an American dollar would last you maybe months. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">It doesn't take much. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">So after two weeks, we found a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in a Japanese section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hongkou</span> , in which lived a Japanese family and a ship's captain and another refugee family. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And uh my mother started working; and I stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with a flyswatter and killed flies. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And my mother wrote a letter <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my father, complaining I am not doing anything all day long except catch flies. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">All of those crazy things I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">Because I didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Where would I go? </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I had no job. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">I couldn't speak the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">QUESTION:  Your mother wrote to your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Did you ever hear back? </span><span class="sentence" id="739">What happened when the war broke out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">ANSWER:  Yes, I have a couple of handwritten letters from my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And also a Red Cross letter, later on, from my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And uh later on, got word that they were sent east; and that was the last I heard of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">QUESTION:  Where was the last that you knew your sister was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">ANSWER:  Sent east.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">QUESTION:  From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">ANSWER:  I don't know if it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> [Czech: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terezin</span> ] or where. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Never found out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">QUESTION:  Your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">ANSWER:  Yes, my father, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Never knew what happened to him, where he was sent, where he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Never found out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">QUESTION:  How did the... Did the start of the European war affect you there in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Did that have any affect on the community or on life there? </span><span class="sentence" id="757">In '39?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  Well, I guess um we were so concerned with surviving on a day-to-day basis, by that time it got summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And the summer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> 1s the greatest enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Besides food, learning how to eat, learning how not to eat, that a drop of water...a drink of water can kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Oh, incidentally, very early on I developed a double-sided pneumonia--pneumonia and pleurisy-- wound up in one of those makeshift uh <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , a converted <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">You know, like you see in "Emperor in the Sun." </span><span class="sentence" id="763">One of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And I also had a very high fever and there was...my mother got me there in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rickshaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I almost jumped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rickshaw</span> , somehow; and she must have told the coolie to keep the two legs high so I wouldn't jump out. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Because I was delirious by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was run by a committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I know I was delirious. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Because I remember one of the scenes where there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and there were all men lying around there, with practically nothing on; because you were lying, sweat was running down your body. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And summer, the humidity is about 90-95 percent, and the humid...temperature is about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">So it is horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">I remember... How much is real, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I remember the doctor coming in with a syringe and a long needle, and giving what I found out later was a spinal--what you call a "spinal tap"--to another young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And not much later he was carried out. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And I remember the next day, the same thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">There was somebody else lying there and he was carried out. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And I remember...I remember only a doctor coming to my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and I thought he had a syringe in his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And weak as I was, I remember I just about doubled up like this and kicked as hard as could right where it hurt most. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">He was just reeling... And he never came back anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Well, I survived it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">QUESTION:  You were saying that your mother told the coolie to keep you. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">How did the Chinese, the Japanese, react to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Tell me about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">ANSWER:  Well, the Chinese did not react at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">You see, neither the Chinese nor the Japanese really ever had any contact with the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Except uh they knew they were whites. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">The whites usually were the powerful class. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Those colonial empires. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">The International Settlement. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">That is how we... That is the reason we didn't need a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">The British lived there for... since 1840, or whenever it was; and the French had the French Concession. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">But they never had any contact with Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">But what was strange that there was a group of whites that didn't have any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Well, they had something like it from the... After the Bolshevik Revolution, the White Russians had come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">But still, we were poorer yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">So the Chinese didn't react. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">The Japanese, who were the real power in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , didn't react. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">At least, at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">I lived with Japanese in one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , became very good friends, went bar hopping with them, did business with them later; and they were very correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="800">QUESTION:  How did Pearl Harbor...how did the war effect what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="801">What changes came? </span><span class="sentence" id="802">When you landed there, you got a part-time job. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Your mother was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">What changes took place with the community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="805">ANSWER:  Great, great, great changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">A lot had happened in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Pearl Harbor--I should say between that I joined the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, which was a subsidiary of the British Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">It was founded, I believe, in 1847, after the Boxer Rebellion for the defense of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And I did not join during the Jewish Corps, which was primarily Russian Jews; but a transport company. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I was driving for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored vehicles-- lorries</span> , things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">It was very advantageous, because I could get a good meal once in awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I had a uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">So I joined that. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And I was very active in a scout group--British Boy Scout Association. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">So then I did some work, my mother was working; so we got by. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And we knew the war would break out. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">We read the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">We had English language papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">We had all kind of papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">The Jewish community really developed out of the...moved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slums</span> , and we built this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community;</span> until it was later on known as "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Little Vienna</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And we knew the war was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">But what could we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="823">We couldn't prepare for it, except trying to get by and survive on a daily basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">We were fortunate we were not among the 8,000 that were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">So we were at least in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> even had a WC--a water closet. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">Which was very important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="827">QUESTION:  Tell me about the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Tell me about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">ANSWER:  There was several <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that were called "heime." "</span><span class="sentence" id="831">Heim"--home, euphemism for <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="832">They were camps that had been established by the various committees, and then later on [by] the Joint Distribution Community, to house those destitute refugees that couldn't even afford a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> or had no money coming from relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were converted <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , converted <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , where they were being fed and housed on a daily basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">For most of us, I think, that was a way station; because we had relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and we had an affidavit to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> stating that we would not become a public burden if we were to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">But, as you know, the quota did not permit us to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="836">QUESTION:  Explain to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">You had relatives, but you ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">ANSWER:  We had relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> And my wife, whom I met later and married later, had relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">But the quota [that] was established was so small that we could not get a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">So we, as well as many other thousands, regarded <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> as a temporary way station. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And then after the quota number would be called, we would leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Pearl Harbor stopped it. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">On the morning of the 8th of December--the other side of the International Dateline--our <span class="DLF">window</span> ... We lived up in a little <span class="INT_SPACE">attic room</span> , with a WC one floor below. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Our <span class="DLF">windows</span> almost shattered, cracked. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">That was when the Japanese blasted the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British warships</span> point blank out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American warships</span> surrendered. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">I knew that that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I immediately dressed in my uniform to report for duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And I walked along the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hongkou</span> to get to the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">There is a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Soochow Creek</span> , which separates <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hongkou</span> from the International Settlement--where I, incidentally, stood guard quite frequently with the Japanese. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And this...like the British soldiers, you know; you walk up and down so many paces without pulling a muscle. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And everybody walking across there, trying to make you laugh. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And I tried to get there and report for duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And I saw...when I got on one of the main drags I saw the columns, the Japanese columns, by the hundreds--if not thousands--marching to the International Settlement. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And I saw what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">So I quickly turned around, went to the <span class="DLF">alley</span> , took off my helmet, my insignia; and quickly got out of uniform and headed back. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">It would have been a disaster, you know, seeing a British soldier among the Japanese troops there. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">So things started tightening up, as far as the Japanese were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">They got a little bit more violent. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">We were under the occupation of the Imperial Japanese Naval Landing Party. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And the Kempeitai’--which was the Japanese * Actually, these were the Japanese secret police. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">gendarmerie--which was a brutal lot, an especially brutal lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Even Japanese civilians went out of the way to not get into trouble with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">So things got a little tighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Some <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> closed; of course, everybody was affected by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Some of my friends were taken prisoner of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">First, they had their arm bands identifying them as British and Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Then, through the Volunteer Corps, I met a Britisher who asked me-- through another friend of mine, Pete was his name, who committed suicide, unfortunately--if I could provide him with some information occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">That took place over a period of meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Wanted to know my attitudes towards the Japanese, and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And then he said if I could help him get information; I was very eager to do so. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And I tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">It would involve planting rumors; which we measured, you know--how long would it take... In a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> you plant a rumor; how long does it take before it gets back to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">As to ascertain troops strengths in certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> , which...
QUESTION:  You were a British spy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">ANSWER:  Unofficially, you might call it this. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I have a... never received any recognition for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">You can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">But I have a medal--which the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> has, incidently--from the British Boy Scout Association for services rendered during occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="880">QUESTION:  The Japanese were allies of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">How did they treat you as Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Did they arrest you? </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Did they subject you to any hardships as Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="884">ANSWER:  Not until 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I didn't mention that it was to our consternation we realized we were under the Japanese--who were Axis partners. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And as I found out later on, the Nazis tried very hard to persuade the Japanese to do with us what they did to the rest of the Jews in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I found later on that Colonel Josef Meisinger--the Butcher of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , he was called--plus a fellow from...Puttkammer, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> ’, and a third Nazi--whose name I can't recall right now--had a meeting with Japanese officials around 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">They went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> , trying to talk to the Japanese. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">They refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">You see, under the oriental religions--Buddhism, Taoism, Shintoism--they really do not practice hate toward other religions. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And there was another factor involved, why they preserved us. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Shall I go into the story of what happened in 1904? </span><span class="sentence" id="893">During the Japanese/Russian War’, under the Tsar, the Japanese, as well as the Russians, needed finances. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">They both applied for finances from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="895">They both went to the investment company [of] Kuhn, Loeb, and Schiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Mr. [Jacob] Schiff hated the Tsar, because the Tsar was anti-semitic; but Schiff made a substantial loan to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , which helped <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> 's war effort against Tsarist Russia. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Incidently, Schiff later on was received by the Emperor himself, and received the Order of the Rising Sun. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">At the same time, there was > Baron Jesco von Puttkammer served as head of the German Information Bureau, a <span class="BUILDING">Nazi propaganda office</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">German Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="899">He was mistaken for a commercial attaché by one Japanese official with whom he had dealings. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">° Officially: The Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905). </span><span class="sentence" id="901">some young Japanese officers that, at the <span class="DLF">border</span> or somewhere, come across the Russian edition--was the original edition--of the Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, which claims Jews practically run the world and own the governments and own the <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> , and all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">They never met a Jew before. "</span><span class="sentence" id="903">Fascinating people! </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Wish we could ever meet those people, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">Maybe we could utilize them. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">We have whole <span class="REGION">Manchuria</span> they laid upon us today. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Maybe we can resettle them in <span class="COUNTRY">Manchuria</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And these young officers became advanced, of course, with the Japanese government. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And, eventually, became the Jewish experts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="910">They...we were under their control. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">They believed every word of what they had heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">So they were very cautious.

Meisinger had proposed three solutions: medical experiments, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp--</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yangtzecam</span> , on an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> --and the most plausible one was to load us all out on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barge</span> , load us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barges</span> , tow us out to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> and scuttle the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">All 18,000 of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">The Japanese refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">There was some other things that...things that leaked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And the Japanese said, "We would never do anything like that." </span><span class="sentence" id="926">So I don't know really how much was resented or didn't want to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">It was not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Because Matsuoka’® really went on record--I believe 1t was Matsuoka: "We will not harm the Jewish population." </span><span class="sentence" id="929">It was a matter of official record. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">But the Japanese didn't have to report to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">They could have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">As I understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">So in 1943, February 1943, they issued a proclamation that as of May 18, all stateless refugees had to assemble in approximately a square mile area, where most refugees already lived, in what was called a designated area--the euphemism for ghetto. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Everybody living <span class="NPIP">outside</span> had to move in. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Now, you should know that this <span class="REGION">area</span> --about | square mile--was already populated by approximately 100,000 Chinese. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">So I once figured it out; it must have had at least twice the density of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="937">Uh, there were no <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> available. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Now many of the old uh batavo (ph) had been rebuilt. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">But still, 1f you lived <span class="NPIP">outside</span> --my wife once with her parents lived on <span class="DLF">Bablinger Road</span> and <span class="DLF">Hardoon Road</span> --how do you find a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Enormous prices. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Blackmail. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">Enormous prices were demanded. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And huge exchanges were made. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">A nice modern <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with steam heat for a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> --no <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , no <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> , no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">WC</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Or...

<p><span class="sentence" id="1013">ANSWER:  Well, I met her in a <span class="BUILDING">bookstore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">I was selling books by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">You see, I didn't know English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">So, I was working first for this Mr. Zahlinger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">Let me start from the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">The first job I got was for a <span class="BUILDING">toy store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And I lived with a Russian family during the day, had lunch with them, and opened a <span class="BUILDING">branch office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">So I became the branch manager. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And I started making a little money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And it was half the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> ; half the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">Chinese bookstore</span> called "<span class="BUILDING">Home of Books</span> ," selling English language books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Pirated editions, because they did not recognize the copyright. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And then this business didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">And then Mr. Zahlinger opened <span class="BUILDING">office furnishing company</span> , selling oil typewriters and Monroe calculators. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">That is how I got into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">office machines</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span> later on.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1036">QUESTION:  I am a little bit worried because of where we are with the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">So let...you met your wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">How did you come to get married? </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Was it a relatively short courtship? </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">Tell me something and how was the wedding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1041">ANSWER:  Very proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Because my wife's mother was very... Her upbringing was such, you know, that I wasn't even permitted to go to the movies with my wife without anybody else present. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">I think I was already fairly well along, after knowing her for a year before I even had a chance for even the first kiss maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">So, unfortunately, my mother-in law...I think in 1942--I am sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">No, it was already the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> --after '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">She contracted bacillary [NB: bacterial] dysentery, and died in one of these <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">So I didn't get along with my mother; and my wife didn't get along with her father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And we had been going, what you call, steady already for quite awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">She had come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> by the civilian railroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">And her mother... And so we decided to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">The question 1s, where do you live? </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">And she had lived with her father and her mother in a little, very small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> --with 3 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couches</span> , very narrow <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couches</span> , and suitcases. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">Nobody had any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">So some of our friends knew that we wanted to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">But they finally twisted her father's arm to live together with somebody else and give us this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">So we got married.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1061">ANSWER:  Well, there were constant rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">We had access to a shortwave--which was sealed, but we had access to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">So there were rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And then we heard there was peace and some of the <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> weren't occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> rebelled, because it wasn't peace yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">We lost a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And I also wound up on a firing squad, when I was outside the designated <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1079">ANSWER:  What I do remember of that period is one of the newspapers, I believe it was the 7th of August 1945, a little column from the Domi news agency--the Japanese news agency-- stating "An Atomic Bomb Was Dropped on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hiroshima</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">No Considerable Damage Resulted." </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">Or something to that effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">I don't...I am trying to find this news article; I don't quite really remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">I don't exactly remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">So we didn't know what an atomic bomb was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">But it came with a...we saw that all the Nazi flags disappeared, the big Japanese flags disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">The Nazis, the Japanese was still in control for quite awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">They were appointed to keep control, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">Which we didn't know, but it was rather uncomfortable then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">But we celebrated with one can of jam that we had saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1090">QUESTION:  I believed you ended up by working for the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">Were the Americans the occupiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1092">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">Both my wife and I, there were again rumors that the Americans were hiring and paying gold dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">American dollars called gold dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">So, by that time I spoke fairly well English already, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And I came to a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , many people all trying to get in the same little <span class="DLF">door</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">And people...American soldiers with white armbands saying "MP"--I didn't know what "MP" stands for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And they're trying to push through there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">And I also remember there came a...Pat, the British contact of mine, was just released from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">He came, escorted by some MPs, through that throng. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">And he saw me and I saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">So he '' This was the American Rescue and Goodwill Mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">pushed his way through, and he grabbed me and got me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">I was one of the first refugees to get a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">I was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> there; there was a sergeant sitting there, American sergeant: "Want a job?"

<p><span class="sentence" id="1151">ANSWER:  Well, we felt very safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">There were bombings going on all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">We could hear it in the distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">We knew and heard that American forces, that the war had finally turned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">You see the first years, '42, '43, the war went bad for allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">We were very worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Then it started to turn, and when we heard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American bombers</span> and something you could see, our spirits rose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And we felt safe because we knew that the Americans knew the location of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">And besides also in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was the largest <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And there were some American prisoners of war in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">So we were not concerned about the attacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">Then on the 17th of July, I changed shifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">The day supervisor asked me to take the day shift in the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">Which was just around the corner where I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for lunch, I bought my two breads <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and that's not very nourishing, but it's nice, fresh bread, so I made a meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And just finished that and I was ready to go to work, and we were just married in April, you know, newly married, and my wife said to me, "Do me a favor, I have bad feelings, I have a precaution alarm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">Stay, stay awhile longer, would you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">So I was still, I said, "Okay, I'll stay." </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And that moment, we heard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> approaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And as always before, I climbed out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> to see better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Some of them were low level flights and you could even see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">So I hung onto the window sill and waved to them as they passed by, except this time we were the target.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1173">QUESTION:  These were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American bombers</span> you were waiving at?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1174">ANSWER: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> B-29</span> 's. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">Later on, I met one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">We became a secondary target because the Japanese had put <span class="DLF">fuel dumps</span> in our <span class="REGION">area</span> , <span class="DLF">ammunition dumps</span> , and a transmitter that directed naval communications, and Americans had to knock it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">So we got hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">To this day, I don't know how we got down from the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Everything collapsed around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">The <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were very, very flimsy built. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">We took fairly heavy casualties and the fire started in the <span class="DLF">lane</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">And I was not one of the guards that had to guard the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">I was the assistant fire chief, so have you ever stood on top of a burning <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to get a fire brigade going? </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">It is impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">But then I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">I want to see what happened there and when I got there, this was one of the worst <span class="DLF">hit lanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">There was nothing left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">My <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> and as usual, the foreman had laid flat on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and fanned himself, and he was down under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boiler</span> and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And I want to see if there 1s still anybody alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">There must have hundreds and hundreds of casualties there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">And I made my way to see the <span class="INT_SPACE">store room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">We had just gotten a load of flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And I saw two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Chinese trucks</span> roll up with Chinese soldiers, puppet soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">So I hid to see what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">They came into the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and loaded up the flour, loaded up the flours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">So as they were driving off, I ran up to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and jumped into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and hid among the flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">So as we rolled down through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I saw one of my friends there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">And I called out to him, from the rear of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , what was happening. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1199">Call Wallach"--the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> , the Russian Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">So I didn't know where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">We left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">But anyhow I was captured and arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1203">QUESTION:  Why were you captured and arrested?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1204">ANSWER:  Because they took the flour to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">They found me among the flour at the rear of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">But they didn't know what to do with me and tried to beat me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">Not much happened and the next day I was released because Mr. Wallach paid $500,000 for me, in Chinese currency. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">That must have been, maybe, $200 some dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1209">QUESTION:  You were taken into a <span class="BUILDING">Chinese puppet barrack</span> because you were in back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorrie</span> which was stealing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">Then you were released. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">Who paid the money to release you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1212">ANSWER:  Mr. Wallach. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">He wanted the flour back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1214">QUESTION:  The owner of the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1215">ANSWER:  We got the flour, we got the flour back so we could at least furnish part of the bread for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">See the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were very badly off because the Joint had stopped sending money to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">The State Department, under the act of trading with the enemy act, you could not lawfully or legally transfer funds to the Japanese occupation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and they didn't take a hint as I understand to route the money to other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">So these poor Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> had to get by on 3 cents per day per person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1219">QUESTION:  How did you get 3 cents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1220">ANSWER:  I had a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">I am talking about those 8,000, 9,000 that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">They were down to nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">Some of them didn't even have literally a shirt or trousers anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">They were walking along with burlap bags around them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">We lost about a total of 3,000 people out of 18,000 to the starvation, disease, heat prostration, some due to Japanese torture, malnutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">What bothers me in this whole period is that so many Jews could have left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , could have left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1227">QUESTION:  You said there was malnutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">Does that mean there was lawlessness as well? </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">How was the community cohering at this point? </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">Was there a sense of community still at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1231">ANSWER:  Yes, very well disciplined as a whole. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">I do remember, I heard about one case, a lawyer--a Austrian gentleman--was caught stealing a piece of bread from somebody else in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> next to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">And he was so embarrassed he committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">All in all, the discipline among the community was extraordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">There was practically no criminality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">I think during the ten year period there were two murders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">We governed ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">We had our own community organization, did our own <span class="BUILDING">arbitration court</span> , the right to appeal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">So it was really well functioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">What did not function so well was the various committees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">They didn't have experience, until the Jomt--and Ms. [Laura] Margolies there from the Joint, who was a trained social worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">She arrived sometime in 1941, and then she was interned as an enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">So she had only a few scant months to really do a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">But whatever she did, she did extremely effectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1245">QUESTION:  How did most of the community that survived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">Was it because of the Joint? </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">Could that be true?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1248">ANSWER:  No, that wouldn't be fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">Because the Joint, I think, sent until the war ended, I think maybe... I don't have the amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">Maybe $2-1/2 million. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">But, you see, that was before <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , before the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">The Joint was in the business of raising money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">But there was no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">They didn't have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">And, unfortunately, some Jews from the Shanghai Council tried to persuade and cabled back to Europe, "Do not send any more Jews here." </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">And the American government finally cabled to various other steamship agencies, tried to prevent more Jews from going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">And Jewish organizations were involved in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">To prevent more Jews from going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , because there was no money there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1259">QUESTION:  New Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> would say the same thing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1260">ANSWER:  These were the old time Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1262">QUESTION:  I believe you were arrested on one occasion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1263">ANSWER:  Yes, it was just shortly before Pearl Harbor, fortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">We were on a scout trip on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> on a Sunday, came to an <span class="REGION">area</span> outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">We had no green, we had no <span class="DLF">lawn</span> , no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">And besides, I wanted to see what was going on around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">So we had a fox hunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">You know what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">A fox hunt is one fellow on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> would lead the way; and we didn't have paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">Paper was very precious and hard to come by. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">Had a handful of rice and scatter it, and the hounds would try to follow the fox and find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">And we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where the chickens had already picked up the rice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">But, anyway, we finally find the fox. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">He got into <span class="BUILDING">Japanese barracks</span> area, <span class="REGION">military area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">And there is a Japanese guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">And there 1s a foreigner on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> scattering rice on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , which is a holy concept. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">Symbolic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">Same as bread to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">So he arrested him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">And one after another, we got in the trap until they had all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">And no communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And so we finally got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , tossed on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> ; we were hustled on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and driven to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">Behind the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">One <span class="NPIP">side</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was a <span class="DLF">rifle range</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">Saw the targets there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">And there were several squads doing target practice; and they line us up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">It was not a very comfortable feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">We didn't know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">And knowing the Japanese, you see, you shoot first and ask questions later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">We are so used to seeing dead people, babies, every day in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">The life is absolutely nothing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">I have seen people murdered point blank there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">So we started communicating, but they called some Japanese which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POWs camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">Apparently from there, they came from a different <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">They couldn't understand our <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> ....Chinese Kaishengka dialect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">So things didn't look good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">All of a sudden, they tried to find out who we are and what we are doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">So my friend--who 1s in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> now--said, "Deutschka (ph)."--Deutsche, in Japanese. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1301">Deutschka? </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">Deutschka?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">So everything was on hold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">So sometime later, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">staff car</span> came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">High ranking officers jumped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">And as you may know, Japanese officers are sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for training. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">Out came two officers who spoke fair German. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1308">Who are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">What are you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">You try to explain fox hunt to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">But we could at least tell them we are Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">We were stateless, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">As stateless, we have less right than a dog in a <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">They could shoot us, and nobody else would ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">So we heard that he called an aide and talked to him; and the aide disappeared while he talked to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">And the aide came back shaking his head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">And then he said...he let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">Promised to never come to this <span class="REGION">area</span> again, and had to promise we would meet him and give him German lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">Later on, I found out through Pat--my British contact--he had called the <span class="BUILDING">German Embassy</span> to verify who we were and nobody answered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">If he would have found out we are not Germans but Jews in a restricted <span class="REGION">area</span> there...
QUESTION:  What was the situation with your mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">Did she leave with you in '47? </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">What happened to her during the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">Did she keep her job all the time? </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">How did she...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1325">ANSWER:  No, she kept her job until she... I had a letter from Miss Margolies of the Joint, as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">She had to be discharged, because there were no more funds for her anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">So we had <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">We lived in one part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ; and my wife lived in another part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with her father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">And then I moved tn there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">My mother also had a handcrafted fur coat, that she had done in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">The Polish furriers were the best in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">And she had smuggled it across the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">And she had this; and she sold this to the General Manager of Standard Oil of the <span class="REGION">Far East</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">And we lived on that for, I think, about three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">So we sold all our belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">A Parker fountain pen would become a symbol for Chinese businessmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">Brought good money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">We sold everything down to what we just...the bare necessities, you see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1339">QUESTION:  What did it do to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">You felt German when you left? </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">Did you feel more Jewish as a result of being there? </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">How did it actually affect you, Shangha1?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1343">ANSWER:  Well, I must say, before we emigrated, we finally didn't eat kosher anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">It wasn't possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">You said, you know, this is really not the intent of being a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">You wouldn't be any less of a Jew by not eating kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">So having solved that problem, I would say, as a whole the community became tighter knit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">And those Jews that were perhaps Agnostics or not religious at all--Atheists--became conscious Jews again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">Very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">We had holiday services with our own <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">We had quite a few rabbis there, services, 1t was a very integrated Jewish life there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">Perhaps like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">The foretaste of life in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">Very cohesive bible community; based on nothing, financially. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">But 1t worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1356">QUESTION:  Why would religious feelings become stronger? </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">Europe was in wreckage, people were refuges, what was it that was pulling people back to Judaism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1358">ANSWER:  Well, I think it was adversity, to try to survive on a daily basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">I think that must be it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">People seemed religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">I think when people are on dire straits, you know, perhaps they turn to God again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1362">QUESTION:  Those people that you knew there, tell me what actually happened to the community? </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">What became of the community? </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">You, yourself, got to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">What about the rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">How may died? </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">What happened to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1368">ANSWER:  Out of nearly 18,000, 3,000 died, and there was several thousand White Russians from the Bolshevick Revolutions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">Now the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">European refugee community</span> lasted for 10 years ('38 to '48), completed disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">A few years ago, there was one Jew left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">He is no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">It was a civilized community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">with a tremendous amount of culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">We had operas, operettas, plays, dramas performed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">It is unbelievable what the Jewish community did there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">It's all gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">Totally swallowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">As you know, Mao Zedong took over in '48, '49. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">I left in July 1947, with my mother and my wife and her father, on the troop transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">And there are no traces of the Jewish community anymore, at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1381">QUESTION:  Where did the Jews go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1382">ANSWER:  Well, those that had relatives and an affidavit, of course, went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">Quite a few went to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">Those that couldn't get a visa from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or didn't pass the very stringent health requirements went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">By that time <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> had gained its independence, and they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1386">QUESTION:  If you had but one statement to say about this whole period from Kristallnacht to the end of the war that you would wish to leave with somebody as to what it mean, what it did to you, what would you say? </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">What is the thing that affected you most? </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">Was it Kristallnacht? </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">Was it being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1390">ANSWER:  Well, I think it was a conglomerate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">It was, of course, Kristallnacht, seeing the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , and seeing the free world stand by. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">In retrospect the free world knew what was happening and didn't move a finger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">I saw how anti-semitism really preceded the whole Hitler period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">The free world must share in the responsibility of what happened to 12 million people there, 6 out of the 12 million were 6 million Jews, and the lack of help originally by the Joint Distribution Commitee that was unable to raise money and send professionals there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">That was unfortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">Later on, the Joint really got money back, got communication again through neutral counties, to feed the thousands of Jews there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">The Joint did a tremendous job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">I don't want to take anything away from the Joint, but the beginning, it was a disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">So what it meant to me, I think it was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">A tough <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1401">QUESTION:  What would you say to people looking at this tape later on? </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">What would you, if you had the sum knowledge that this gives to you that you would wish to give youngsters who come to see it, what would you say to them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">Is there something you would want to say to them about what has happened to you and your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1404">ANSWER:  Well, I think it has a meaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">It 1s definitely of importance for the younger generation, Jews and otherwise, to know what happened, because I think we have to involve ourselves in Jewish life and in community life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">We have to make sure that we involve ourselves in a democratic process, especially here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">Because if we don't, if we are apathetic as the whole population is and the Jewish community is, we may wake up one day under a dictatorship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">Most of the people are turned out by politics and politicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">And this is the danger that I see.</span></p>
