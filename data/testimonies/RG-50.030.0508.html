<p><span class="sentence" id="648">ANSWER:  My brother -- my mother the -- realized the situation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poinyavich</span> was rather hazardous, so she sent my brother to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> to tell my father not to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">So my brother went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> to tell my father what the situation is, and that my mother said don’t come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And what happened is that my brother, and my father, who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , were placed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And they stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> I think about a year and a half or two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">They were then transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , and it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> that my father died, really from starvation, because whatever meager rations he received, he gave to my brother --

<p><span class="sentence" id="656">ANSWER:  Well, right after the war I remember seeing a list of survivors which was published by the American Red Cross, and my father’s name appeared there as being killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , and it also appeared that my brother survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And then I heard from other people, relatives and whatnot, that my brother survived, and he is in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">It seems that my brother tried to get in touch with me, but he didn’t have the right address because since that -- since he had the address when I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we moved and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And I never received any mail from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And he was in -- I guess in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and --

ANSWER:  That was -- well, the end of the war was 1945, and he got married at the end of ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I think the child was born in ’46, so -- and I was not able to communicate with my brother directly, so it seems that all the letters which I sent to him, and the return address which he sent to me, went through a third party. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">He was afraid that if the Russians find out that he has a brother in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , a capitalist, whatever, that he will lose his job because at one point he had a very good job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poinyavich</span> right after the war, but then somebody said, you know, his father was a capitalist and he has a brother capitalist and so he got fired, because his brother is a capitalist and his father was a capitalist. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">So he was afraid to disclose that he has a brother in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">However, in subsequent years, I sent him packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Again, not directly to him, but through a third party, and he would be able to barter the packages for either food, or for whatever else, or sell it, and that has enabled him to live a better life than otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">So with the help of the packages which I sent him regularly for many years, he subsequently is a very capable man, spoke Lithuanian fluently, spoke Russian fluently, spoke Yiddish fluently, all these things which I couldn’t do, he was able to do very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And so he got a -- a very significant job with the Russian government and he was in charge of food distribution for the -- for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilna</span> and it’s surrounding. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Well, that was a very big job because with food you cou -- in those days, you could trade and help people in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">The story goes, supposedly, I don’t know whether it’s true or not, but when the president of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , the prime minister had a birthday party and he needed vodka or food or whatever, he had to get permission from my brother to get these supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">So he had a fairly good job, and then he was in charge also of their <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> which -- which were built to cater to foreign dignitaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">So that he had occasion to go to all the Russian -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , to some of the other <span class="COUNTRY">Russian countries</span> , whatever, and learn how to run a -- an outs -- what I would call a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that caters to dignitaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And he had a fairly good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">The first time I actually met -- saw my brother since I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in 1936 was in 1988. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">That’s 52 years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And I met my brother in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">It seems that a Maccabee team from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to participate in the games and my brother was very much involved with the soccer team in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , and so he came, he got permission to travel with the team to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for the soccer games. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And that is the first time that I met -- I saw my brother after 52 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">QUESTION:  What was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER:  It was very difficult to say the leas -- the least, but you know, he -- he is a very outgoing person, very -- very able, and he -- if I say so myself, he adored me, because I am his source of survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And I finally convinced him in 1988 to move to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , because he had such a good job in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">He had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , he had a dacha, he had computers, he had everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And here he has to give it all up and move to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> where his children don’t speak the language, where -- well, he spoke some Hebrew because he went to a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew high school</span> , but it’s starting a whole new life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">ANSWER:  So [had to promise him that I will get him a <span class="BUILDING">condominium</span> for him, a <span class="BUILDING">condominium</span> for his daughter, for his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">I will get them <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , and I will make sure that they will be able to live in relative comfort in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And it was only after these promises that he has agreed to move to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">So in 1989, I think, he moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">QUESTION:  Did you want him to move to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">ANSWER:  Really, I don’t think he would have been as happy in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">First of all, there was a big migration of Soviet Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">So a lot of his friends came --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">ANSWER:  -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">It would have been a -- much more difficult for him and for his family to acclimate to a life in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">QUESTION:  And they were allowed to leave in 89?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="713">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">ANSWER:  And what we have in common is basically our parents and our Jewish tradition, and my responsibility since my father was killed, that I had to take over and provide for the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">But we didn’t have this close relationship that normally brothers have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">ANSWER:  We lived in different worlds. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and he lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">We were both very comfortable, he in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and I in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="723">ANSWER:  Well, actually he never really wanted to discuss his life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , or his life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">He did tell me about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> that when the Americans were nearing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> that the Germans decided to vacate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and they decided to march them east. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And he tells me the story that while they were marching in the -- through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and his feet, he -- were bleeding, he was exhausted, and he tells me that he couldn’t take it any more and he and a friend of his decided to fall to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and whatever it is, it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And he tells me the story about this German soldier that came across him and said to his friend, don’t waste a bullet on him, he is dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And so they passed by and he then wi -- with his friend, ran to find food or shelter, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And they came across a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and when they knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , the Germans were frightened obviously and they said wa -- all we want is some food and -- and some water, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And the Germans said, we don’t have any food, but the American army is across on that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and if you cross that <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , y-you’ll find the American army and they will be able to help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And you better hurry up because the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> 1s going to be blown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So with whatever strength he and his friend had, they ran across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and no sooner did they get to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> blew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">But by that time they were on the side where the Americans were, and so they received food, shelter and so forth from the American army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">QUESTION:  But that’s all he was [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  That’s all he -- but he wouldn’t have -- he wouldn’t tell me about the -- his experiences in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , about the killings in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">You know, he didn’t a -- and he didn’t discuss -- he doesn’t discuss much about his life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , either. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Although, I understand from some cousins of mine that when he was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , my father arranged for him to get married in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And he must have been then -- what wa -- 16 - 17, and that his wife was taken away, and- from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or whatever, and he never saw her again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">QUESTION:  And -- but he didn’t tell you this. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">It was other people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">ANSWER:  He didn't -- he didn’t tell me that, because I don’t think his current wife knows about it, that he was married.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="752">ANSWER:  Well, it had -- it -- obviously it’s a very central part of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">This is why I am so committed to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">This is why I am committed to the importance of the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , because it’s my view that if we had an <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> at the time, we had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that would have admitted Jews, maybe my parents could have been saved, and my parents wou -- with not only my parents, with my grandparents, my uncles, my cousins, everybody else that was killed by the Lithuanians in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So I have done a number of things to memorialize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">One of the things which I always hoped, that I would be able to bring my parents over, and to give them the type -- the kind of lifestyle that they gave me when I was a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And obviously that was not to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">So I got involved in building a <span class="BUILDING">geriatric center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And I felt, while I may not be able to take care of my parents, I will be able to take care of other parents, who will be able to finish their years in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where they could -- are surrounded by their own people, and they would spend the rest of their life in dignity, and -- so we build this communities -- this <span class="BUILDING">geriatric center</span> , which is called the Gurwin Jewish geriatric center. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">It’s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Commack</span> , <span class="REGION">Long Island</span> , and it 1s an -- if I say so myself, an outstanding <span class="BUILDING">geriatric center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">It has 460 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , it has another 120 daycare patients, and it has <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> with assisted living for 200 units. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And so I have devoted a lot of time, effort and energy to build this <span class="BUILDING">geriatric center</span> , and to maintain it in a style which would be a credit to the Jewish community.</span></p>
