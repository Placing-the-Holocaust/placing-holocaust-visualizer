<p><span class="sentence" id="396">ANSWER:  That was the time when -- when most Jews realized that things would not get any- an-any better any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Before we always thought Hitler’s regime might stop any moment it ca -- when it came to a certain point, and it would not get worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">At that time we realized we couldn’t stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">That’s when people -- many people really started looking to get out seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Many, of course, had left already in 1933, but these were the Jews who lived in very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , mostly in <span class="REGION">south Germany</span> and they were worse off than the Jews who lived in b -- in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , because everybody knew everybody and people were beaten up and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in these small <span class="NPIP">place</span> , much more than b -- in big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">But after this happened at the anschluss and later on Kristallnacht, we came to the conclusion that there was no way of staying here.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="437">QUESTION:  And who did you work through to get the papers? </span><span class="sentence" id="438">You said you had that relative who had already completed the 20 affidavits -- 1-in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you said you had a relative who had sponsored 20 people, it -- did you work through him also?</span></p>
