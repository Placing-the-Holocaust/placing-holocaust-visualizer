<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Please give us your name, your place of birth, and the date of your birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name 1s Joseph Levine, and I was born on July 20, 1907, in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malodezna</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And will you now give us a little background of your childhood, growing up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Well, I...1n 1914, when I was 7 years old, my father and five children were already in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and they sent passports to my mother and the other four children, including me, to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Because of the war we could not go into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so we were stuck. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">By early 1915, as the Germans approached our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we had to flee for our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">So I recall how the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , we left on an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal car</span> in the rain not knowing where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We came to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> and there the whole...other people 1n the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> were marched to the central square...square where there were three <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We spent a few nights in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> which were filled with refugees and what few belongings they had, and my mother find a relative and we moved into a crowded, small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we stayed for at least 6 months or longer because I recall I went to <span class="BUILDING">Cheder</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">When things got so bad that we stood in <span class="DLF">line</span> for a piece of black bread with Zeppelins overhead, my courageous mother took her four children and we started a journey in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I don't...I'm sure she didn't know where we're gonna end up, and the...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> took us across <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , and into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ha Binh</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harbin</span> ’ at least for 4, 5 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">We finally made contact with the family in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and once contacts were made through an uncle of mine...he who was one of the founders of the UJA, very prominent in Jewish life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">A man named Abe Edelberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Uncle Abe arranged for us to try to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harbine</span> , and we then traveled from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harbine</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> , and then we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> and lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kobe</span> for a little while and then we sailed from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yokohama</span> and we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> on February 12, 1917. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">From there, we traveled by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to...overnight stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> , <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> , where we joined my grandparents and my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So that my first years, my early life in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was spent in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> where I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">In 1930...uh...in 1926, I entered Franklin and Marshall College, graduated in 1930, was admitted to the Graduate School for Jewish Social Work, which is no longer in existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And at the end of my first year, I was offered a job with the Jewish Board of Guardians, which was then the largest <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Psychiatric Clinic</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I spent 6 years with the <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">In 41, I took a civil service exam for parole officer, started as a parole officer by '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I had to beat everybody in the state, and was appointed to the position of executive case supervisor, and I had that job 'til '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">In 1943, one of my brothers was involved in very important war work. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Sol, I left the division and went to work with him, and at the end of the war in '45, the American Jewish Joint Distribution ' located approx. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">800 km north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pyongyang</span> in the <span class="REGION">Heilonjiang Province</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchuria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Committee issued an appeal for social workers to work overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So I got a job with the Joint, as 1t was known, and after a month's indoctrination or so, I was sent to Europe and I was member of the first group of Jewish social workers that came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work with the survivors of the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  When you arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Well, originally I understand my orders were to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I might say that when I got to Europe, we spent a week or so in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and nobody really knew what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> where I was supposed to work, but reports came in that there were hundreds of Jews in trouble and needing food, clothing, and so forth in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So I went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I found these Jews and they needed...they weren't registered with UNRRA‘. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So it was a question of getting them jobs, getting them food, and getting them registered and later on helping them to meet their needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So I began to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And slowly, I discovered Jews were living in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> so I began traveling to these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and there again I found an interesting thing that in a number of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , the handful of Jews living there were the survivors of the infamous, what I call infamous, death marches. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">The Germans at the end of the war marched thousands of Jews through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And at the end when they decided to leave, they killed half of the survivors and those that survived dug <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> and got into the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So as I got into these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> I found the Jews living in the old <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> , over <span class="DLF">manure piles</span> , and <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> and my job was to get them <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> and food and shelter, clothing and...I had Eisenhower's...General Eisenhower's orders in my pocket for the Germans to provide decent housing for them so I was able to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And what happened...what happened then when you started working with these people? </span><span class="sentence" id="41">What were some of your experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Well, I had many experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It should be noted that almost 95 or 99 percent of these Jews were Polish Jews and apparently they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> used to organized life, so one of the first thing they did wherever they settled, they formed their own organizations, so I worked through an organization so I had somebody to talk to, committees who wanted food, clothing, money; who needed help. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">They had trouble with UNRRA. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">UNRRA, with the United States Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Uh...I left my wife and two <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I'll never forget one of the first experiences was being from the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burglengenfeld</span> where I met a little, small child named Ruthie. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Ruth Fleischer, who had been in hiding...hidden with a Polish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Her father was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Her mother lived 1n this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">She went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and found Ruth. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And when I met Ruth, I'll never forget the little one said to me, "Mr. Levine," in Yiddish, "I am 10 years old and I don't know how to read and write. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Please help me go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="54">First thing the child asked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But at the beginning, as I said, we had Jews coming and going. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">There were Jews drifting in from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">There was always the question of * The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">housing for these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">At one point, not too long after I came, we had to open a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent city</span> ...tent city near the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cham</span> , C-H-A-M. I want to digress for a moment to say that I was...God was good to me because on the first day of my work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> , in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where Jews hadn't lived for...maybe never lived, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German town</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was built in the 1400s. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I met a young man named Moshe, M-0-S-H-E, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rechnitz</span> , R-E-C-H-N-I-T- Z. Moshe was about 21 or 22 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">He spoke a number of languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">He came from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and I employed him right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Moshe was my driver and my assistant almost like my son. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Wonderful young man, so I was...he...he was really my right arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And while I'm talking about Moshe, I might say that he himself spent...was in 5, 6 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">His mother was killed in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> , <span class="BUILDING">munitions plant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and he was on one of these death marches. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And one morning he and I were driving through these beautiful <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bavarian hills</span> when we came to beautiful <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">He stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and he asked me to follow him, went down a little...a little brook and there I saw shoes, odd shoes laying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and he told that he was...when he was on a death march, when they came to this little...this <span class="REGION">area</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stamsreid</span> , the Germans killed half of the handful of survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And he was one of the living on these people the survivors dug a <span class="DLF">grave</span> , there was a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> and Moshe was freed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stamsreid</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Now, I traveled from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because these where Jews were organized and these people needed money for food for programs that they ran, and the Joint really financed most of their stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I worked mostly with UNRRA, which provided food and clothing, and the United States Army, so I ended up being the spokesman for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I had a simulated rank of lieutenant colonel which meant nothing except that it gave me entree to top <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I dealt with the generals in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , general 4th Armored Division, so that I had no trouble there. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Now, many...of course, I have many memories of a lot of things happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I want: to describe some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">One morning I was in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> when two men came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">One of them turned to me and said, "Levine, you and the Joint are doing a good job providing food, clothing and shelter, but we need something for the Geist." </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I think this happened later in the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">At any rate, this incident happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I said, "What do you mean by Geist?" </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He said, "Something for the spirit of the Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I looked at the man and I said, "What are you talking about?" </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He said, "We need a Yiddish newspaper." </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I might digress for a moment to say that I was fortunate to have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , shortly after...after my arrival and was at that <span class="BUILDING">printing plant</span> when the first copy of the...called Unser Weg, the Yiddish paper, came off the press, and I brought a copy to give to the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So there's a man who wants a paper published in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So I asked who he was, and he says, "My name is Silverberg,and I was the editor of the Moment in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , which meant nothing to me, but I later learned that the Moment was the New York Times of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And he said, "What you need is a newspaper." </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I thought the guy was crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I had visions of, you know, what's involved in printing a paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So I said, "How are you going to print a paper?" </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So he then told me that before the war, he dealt with a <span class="BUILDING">firm</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> that supplied types for <span class="REGION">European countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He was confident that even though the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was bombed...1t was bombed, he knew where in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> he'd find Yiddish type. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Then the said, "If...1f you pay for this thing, and pay the expenses...this man introduced me, and now I will go around...we're gonna find hand typesetters." </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I said, "Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">What are you going to print 1t on?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="97">Oh," he says, "I've already found a local German printer and made arrangements where if we pay him, he'll print it." </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I said, "That's fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">What about a paper and ink?" </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He said, "That's where you gotta come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We already located a German who has a lot of paper and ink hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">You'll have to get the requisition to...through the United States Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I believed I involved Rabbi Gene Lipman in this deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">At any rate, the paper finally came out called Der Najer Moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And a interesting thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Shortly before I left for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I got...recetved a telephone call from an excited Jew, claiming that there were hundreds of Jews at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And that the commotion, couple of them were shot and there was trouble at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So I grabbed the man, Abe Cohn, he came to replace me and we jump in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and I had one of the UNRRA men drive the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and I don't think any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> ever cut across the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Lucky we weren't killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">When I got to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and found six hundred Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Apparently, these people were being transported I later learned from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> near the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> broke down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So when I arrived Jews are sleeping on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , some in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> , couple tried to make fires to light something. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">On the far end, there were railroad and German police surrounding young kids, and I understand one young kid was shot in the legs and now...a day later brought him back from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I learned that these six hundred people-this was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> --were given a couple hours notice to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">There were no chaplains on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">It was a shameful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">They were given a couple slices of meat and bread and no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And I learned that at night some of the young G.L.'s shot their guns in the <span class="DLF">air</span> so the Jews 1n each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> thought they were killing Jews so he told me this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">At any rate, as soon as I learned all this I had all my food I had in my litlle <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> sent over. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Emptied my <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Got a hold of the UNRRA, which sent me huge cans of soup and bread and they finally fixed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> , and as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulled out I wished at that moment that every [American] Jew could have been with me as these Jews, American Jews who made all this possible, as they waved, thanking me. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Then I went back to my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in order to get <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , spent a hour on the telephone just to be connected. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I reported this to my <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">A day later checked...I made arrangements and in the future no transports went out without a chaplain. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Now, I didn't get into my pajamas until about 12 o'clock at night when I received a telephone call from Silverberg, the editor of the Moment, asking that I come to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I was exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Said something very important happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I rushed to his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and he introduced me to two men who escaped from the transport who knew Silverberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">One was = Schlomoberl Berlinsky, who was supposed to have been one of the leading novelists in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and a man named Mendel Mann, who was one of the rising Yiddish poets in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">He introduced me and he wanted me to meet them because these men had no identification. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">They had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">To make sure the next morning I could take care of them so they wouldn't be picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">While we were talking, Silverberg told me that he would like to print something by these two men to let the world know that they are alive, but he said this presents a problem because I've got the paper set for publication. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And it would cost money to reset the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And I said, "Go ahead and do it.." Well, to make the story short, the paper came out and shortly thereafter, I was driving to Silverberg's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where outside I saw two young men, one of whom I recognized and he recognized me. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Was a member of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kibbutz Nahum</span> , it was a kibbutz about 20 kids, Ha-Shomer ha-Tsa'ir’, and I * Hebrew: "the Young Guard"; a collectivist and utopian Zionist youth movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Mostly active was like their substitute father. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And the kids rushed over to me, and the strange kid held the Moment like a hot coal in his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And the kid that knew me asked me, "Where did...where does the editor live?" </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Silverberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So I said, "What's the excitement about?" </span><span class="sentence" id="144">He said, "Let him tell you." </span><span class="sentence" id="145">This kid told me that before the war, he and his mother and sister and, I think, and father, lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> [or] in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> ; either of the two. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">At any rate, while his father was awlay seeing his publishers, he and his mother and sister were put in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="147">He lost his mother and sister, never saw his father, and he said that after the war he and another buddy decided to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to look for their relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They came to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamberg</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war, and from there they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">He told me how he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> looking for his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">He knew his mother died and sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">He came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamberg</span> and went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> that night, got up in the morning and found our paper, the Moment, which was distributed. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">He took the Moment, and there's an article about his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">He said, "Where 1s my father?" </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So that night we reunited father and son, if did nothing else with the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Well, at any rate, that's the newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">A number of other interesting things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">For instance, in '46 most of...for all these Jews, for almost all of them, it was the first free... mean it was the first time they could observe Pesach as free man. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">You know, the war is 39, 46 and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So for days, the Joint sent me in a shipment of matzoh and wine and I spent my travel money to make arrangements with communities to come in and pick up their requisitions. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And for a week or two Moshe and I spent time doling out matzoh and wines and Haggadot and they gave them money to buy fish. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And several things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">When I...after I got through meeting with the last delegation, I went up to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to call <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and I reported that everything was distributed. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They then asked whether I gave...distributed wine or matzoh to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Deggendorf</span> ...1200 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So I told them they hadn't sent it...they didn't send me anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I felt so wonderful and suddenly the bottom fell out. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">No wine for 1200 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So I called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deggendorf</span> and they were smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They made their own wine, and they baked their own matzoh. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Well the reason I tell this story 1s that at that tume the chief medical officer for the <span class="REGION">area</span> which had 300,000 DPs...there were only a very small number of Jews, like I don't know many thousands...4 thousand, 5 thousand, where the Jewish doctor, woman doctor from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> a Dr. Anna Monatov (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I remembered her. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I also had working with me a nurse sent by the Jewish Agency, Becky Lyons, who is still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">She is now...she has a doctorate, which she is now a world authority in hospital administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Lectures all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And then there was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span> major from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> , a kid named Badian. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And I invited these three to be my guest, you know, for seder to join the people I was with. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">After the service in the <span class="BUILDING">makeshift synagogue</span> , oh, yes, and the president of the Gemeinde, of the community was the man named Jacob Gottlieb, who unfortunately was my age but his hair was white because I was told he watched his wife and two children thrown in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">At any rate, so we went to the first seder...to seder with the kids in the kibbutz and it was heartbreaking for me because there were 20 kids, no mother, no father, no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">We had a comparatively short service. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">No meat of course, just simple seder, but what we lacked in food the kids made up 1n spirit in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> before Second World War and formed many kibbutzim in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> after the War. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">as they did all...every time I was with them, their singing and their dancing, and they singing like they're going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Wonderful singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">When I...we left the kids about lO o'clock at night, my guests and I walked toward the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Now, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> 1s a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> which has <span class="DLF">streets</span> like those in...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> is a thousand years old or more. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">So as we approached...it was a moonlight night, and as we approached the...the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Center building</span> which, incidently, was in the shadow of a hugh <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> built 4 or 5 hundred years ago, we heard noises coming from the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And came to the <span class="BUILDING">Center</span> and we found that they had a community seder on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">They cleaned out all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , put up these wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and as we walked in, they had just finished their meal and I saw a sea of men and women and this little child and they weren't happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">But as soon as they saw us, they began to sing and then sang another song. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Suddenly, they were not alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Within a few minutes four guys ran downstairs and they brought up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">This was a seder. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">The guy began...one of of the men sat at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , began to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">The other was singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Then two or three couples got on the top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and began to dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">While this was going on, I saw one man throw...they had huge <span class="DLF">windows</span> , <span class="DLF">German windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">He threw them out as if to let the world know that the Jews are still alive and they sang as loud as they could as if to let the Germans and the world know that they were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">At any rate, this seder went on til about another hour or so, then I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and wrote a letter to my wife describing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">That was the first seder. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I think it's important to describe the first Hanukkah. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">The first Hanukkah, this is in 45. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">This was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">The Jews had no <span class="BUILDING">Jewish center</span> there so I got a...I requisitioned an old <span class="INT_SPACE">beer hall</span> which...when the Germans stopped using a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , you can imagine what condition it was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">But the Jews cleaned it up, repainted the <span class="DLF">walls</span> , and had the section put up...the section for a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and the rest was for a <span class="BUILDING">social hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And I got military permission --there was a curfew-- for the Jews to stay out late that night, and we had our first Hanukkah light lit in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">makeshift synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">It happened that at that time...first I got to say that before this <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ...before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> , our service, I might tell you that I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> with a bunch of mail and letters and so forth, and while I was...came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> of the President Schwarzfuchs, I noticed a gentleman sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">He was a bearded man sitting like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">He suddenly turned to me and say, "Was fur ein Joint ist da?" </span><span class="sentence" id="208">The Joint is our organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So I turned to Schwarzfuchs, I said, "Who is this man?" </span><span class="sentence" id="210">He says, "He is a Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">He came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Survivors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So I said, "Was meint ihr? </span><span class="sentence" id="214">What do you mean?" </span><span class="sentence" id="215">He says, "Wo ist die Mikvah fur die Weiber?" </span><span class="sentence" id="216">You know the mikvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I'm in this stinking little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="218">Und wo sind die Hanukkah-Lichter ftir Hanukkah?". </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I didn't realize Hanukkah was in another week. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So I went down...so within a few days I went to a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , <span class="BUILDING">military warehouse</span> , in a place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Walhalla</span> , on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> , not from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And when the supply man wouldn't give me any candles...I figured I'd get candles and cut them half and distribute them. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">So he wouldn't give me that so I got the...called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Took me an hour to get through. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And the man in charge gave me...gave this guy permission to give me some cases of candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So my driver and I then went back and we were cutting candles in half when I got phone call from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and advising me that the Rabbi, Chaplain Gene Lipman, had been to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , brought back Palestinian candles, and holders, the Menorahs, and was on the way and within a short time Gene came with his assistant, Si Pava, and the four of us were sorting bundles of candles and we distributed them to the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Now let me go back to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> So the first Hanukkah light I thought I'd spend it with the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">It was my own...almost just like my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And this Rabbi was still there, so he gave a address. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">He spoke about a half an hour, and then there was joy and we had kegs of beer and we celebrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I spent...went a few other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> for different Hannukahs. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">But the Jast Hanukkah candle lighting and I attended the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> was not too far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And the head of the community was man named by Steven Schwartz, who was an engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Wonderful gentleman. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And I took with me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> , I think I brought the Rabbi, Joseph Glazer, who...later we gave him the title of Oberrabbi, Chief Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">He's alive and lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cedarhurst</span> , <span class="REGION">Long Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And we came to...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I walked in to a magnificent, newly painted <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I learned that during...the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was built in 1907. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">During the war the Germans turned it into a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">After a war, the young man appeared and told Steven Schwartz that he was a native of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">His grandfather, I think, built the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">That in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> they would find the original plans for it, and sure enough in a case they found the original, you know, architectural and drawing plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And there's a Jewish town major and they forced the Germans to redo the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> as it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So Steven Schwartz used that...used this oocasion of the last candle almost like a rededication of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> I'll never forget Steven had a huge Menorah built in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and he had huge candles 1n it. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Must have been stolen from some <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">On the Bimah, he had covered with velvet, he had this beautiful, little, hand carved Menorah I bought...you know, the Gene Lipman from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and Palestinian candles were lit. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Can you picture the scene? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">In the audience were the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> , a few Jewish GIs, and Schwartz arranged a program which included music by the first musical group in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Deggendorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And as I listened to them, there were tears down my eyes to think that thousands and thousands and thousands of Jews with that kind of talent were burned in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I was the last speaker, and I'll never forget looking into these sad faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And when I got through, it was like a wind came in and slowly they drifted out. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I sat down and wrote my wife a letter and I, of course, realized what do they have to be happy about? </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Hanukkah, the joyous moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So that was the Hanukkah. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I went one later on, but I missed my first great experience and I better tel] it now, and that 1s my visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">On October 6, 1945, the day before I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> , I heard there is a camp at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I didn't know too much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">The Joint at that time had a pool of two or three drivers so one of the men was assigned to drive me and it was obvious he was very reluctant to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">It was a beautiful morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">We parked the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> at the far end of the <span class="DLF">lot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">We didn't know what we're going to find. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">It was a large installation, <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">As it turned out that the first <span class="BUILDING">building</span> I walked into was the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And the driver, this man was in back of me...I believe there was a German guide. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I can't say for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">At any rate, we walked into what I learned was the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">The <span class="DLF">walls</span> were covered with blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Now, it's beautiful, painted white if you go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">It's a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">From the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , I walked into the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that had three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I recall turning back and looking at this man's face. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">It was green. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And mine...mine must have been the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I walked into a <span class="INT_SPACE">third room</span> , and the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was lined with shelves with small earten jars. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And I looked down and in front of me were two barrels of human ashes. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">My blood must have been frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I turned to my right and I wanted to grab the first thing I could and there was a barrel with these earthen jar covers, which I brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And by that point I wanted to get out into the sunlight. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And I didn't want to see anything of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And we walked to the far end of the <span class="DLF">lot</span> and we got to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And the man turned to me and said, "Levine, look what you got in your hands?" </span><span class="sentence" id="284">The jar covers were just almost like glued. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So we finally calmed down, both of us and I might say that as we were leaving, we saw Germans playing Fuball, soccer. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">They were guards who were prisoners of the United States army. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">They were being fed 4,000 calories a day as prisoners, while the Jews were getting 1700 calories a day from <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> and the military, most of it potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">At any rate, as we left, we got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We both calmed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And after 5 minutes or so the man turned...said to me, "Levine, did you notice that I was reluctant to drive you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I said, "Yes." "</span><span class="sentence" id="292">So, I'll tell you why." </span><span class="sentence" id="293">He says, "I was on the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> ...last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> that was brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">The Americans were approaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">They couldn't even talke us in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="296">They took us on a march about 30 kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I was on the march from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Almost half of the people dropped dead or were shot on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And before the Germans ran away...this was the pattern...they'd shot half of the survivors." </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And he said, "I was among the living and I ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">That's why you found me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Then he said, "Who would have thought that I who was brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> to be exterminated would walk through and come out alive." </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So that's; just one of the incidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I want to say something about my dear friend, Chaim Diamond. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Chaim Diamond was a young man who, with his younger brother, were survivors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Chaim was the president of the little community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eggenfelden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">He later became active and was a member of the Central Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And I left him in '46. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We renewed friendship in '56 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , where he is a successful businessman and we've been friends ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And while talking about Chaim, I can also talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eggenfelden</span> because this is an example of what kind of work I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">For instanae, one day I received a telephone call from the UNRRA Director, who was a gentlemen from <span class="REGION">Virgin Islands</span> named Johnson. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">He called me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I'd never heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eggenfelden</span> but he called me up and told me the story that there were Jews living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eggenfelden</span> under horrible living conditions and that there was a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> ...I thought he said it was owned by a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">At any rate, which is about to be turned over to the Germans by the town major, and he suggested that I try to come down and maybe try to get the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So I drove to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eggenfelden</span> and I had my notes <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I took inventory of how Jews lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Six people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , five people 1n one little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">twin bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">It was horrible conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So I talked to the Jews, came back, saw the colonel in charge of this department for the army, gave him the report at 9 o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">By 4 o'clock in the afternoon he sent over a message to me, "You can have the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So they arranged for the Jews to move into the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">That wasn't all. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">After the Jews settled, the delegation came to me, "We need a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish center</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So we found an abandoned <span class="BUILDING">building</span> not...almost a block away from the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and I got that from the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And the Jews again cleaned it up, painted it, so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I took some people with me for the...on the official opening, and what a joy it was to walk into this newly-painted <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">The fixtures were made by a man who was in the business in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war, and they made the fixtures from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> ...parts of parts of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> , and there were Jewish musicians singing and dancing until about 4 o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">That was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eggenfelden</span> where Chaim Diamond was one of the leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="328"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deggendorf</span> has to be mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="329"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deggendorf</span> was a camp of 400 Jews in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , mostly German Jews who were rescued from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and Chaplain Lipman had a lot to do with them coming there. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And I must say that I met Gene Lipman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and he said, "We'll get together." </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Two days after I was in the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwandorf</span> , Gene Lipman appeared with his assistant, Si, Simon Pava, P-A-V-A, wonderful Chaplain's assistant. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And he said, "Joe, what did you bring with you from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Can you take it with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="334">We're going to a birthday party." </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And, of course, I was there only one day, so I had stuff that I brought from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Canned stuff to give away. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Put it in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and we road to the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Terschenreuth</span> (ph) where there were four sisters whom Gene helped to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">He realled saved their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">We had a wonderful party. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">That night I slept with Gene in a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">At 6 or 7 o'clock in the morning I was awakened by Gene. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">He said, "Joe, we're going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deggendorf</span> ," which meant nothing to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And it was my first four hour ride in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Almost killed my insides. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">We got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deggendorf</span> and when people saw Gene and his assistant, it was almost that noise like a messiah came. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Hundreds of people suddenly began approaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">See, Gene was one of the saviors. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was well- organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">A woman named Kitty Rothschild ran it til the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">At any rate, what happened...I'm telling you the story of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deggendorf</span> because when Gene appeared he carried bags of mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">The Jews had no mail service, so Gene...and these people had a lot of American relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So Gene arranged with these Jews to address letters to Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">He sent them out in his own envelopes, with a note: Send your reply to me and I'll deliver it. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So he set up a mail service which I inherited. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And that was part of my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I did that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I might say that while doing that Jews came over to me to ask me to find their relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So the mail would come and I had an uncle named Jake Bernstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">He moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So some guy would give me a name Izzy Cohen, he moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Go find Izzy Cohen I didn't have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">copying machine</span> , damn it, but I cabled to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and got telephone books and with my boy and I...with Moshe and I would sit sometime most of the night copying all the Goldbergs like J. Goldberg from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , and I sent him a letter with a note that so and so comes from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">He's looking for his uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Maybe you're his relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Once in a while I got a reply. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">That was part of the mail service. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">My work, as I said, required providing food, clothing and shelter. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">We faced a situation where Jews after the Kielce Pogrom’, we had hundreds of Jews coming into the <span class="REGION">United States Zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We lacked housing for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">QUESTION:  Where was the Kielce Pogrom from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER:  What?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  Where was the Kielce Pogrom from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">The Jews returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and there was antisemitism and they killed a number of Jews, so Jews fled from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And this was already in '46 and I got to tell you a story how I was in...at the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span> , came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> tired, when I found a message. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Report to * The Kielce Pogrom took place on 4 July 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Forty-two Jews were killed, and the incident initiated a mass migration of surviving Eastern European Jews to the West. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">General Perkins, 4th Armored Division, immediately upon your arrival. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So as tired as I was, I jumped in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and went to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And when I came in...I'm not trying to impress you, but it's interesting that there were Colonels and Majors waiting to see the General, Chief of Staff'a man named Erzag (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I remember him. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">As soon as he saw me, he went into the <span class="BUILDING">General's office</span> , out marched a couple of colonels and I was ushered into the <span class="BUILDING">General's office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">There was another General with him, Robert (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">The General greeted me and he did something he never did before. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">He had a basket of cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">He said, "Joe, sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Have a cigarette." </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I smelled something. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I said, "You wanted to see me immediately on my arrival." </span><span class="sentence" id="390">So he said...he told me then what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">He said, "While you were gone, the General and I discussed the problem of housing for the Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="392">You see the Army was responsible for a lot of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And they wanted efficiency and they then told me...so he then said, "We decided we found a way to solve the problem." </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I said, "What do you have in mind?" </span><span class="sentence" id="395">he said, "Well in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pocking</span> (P-O-C-K-I-N-G) down near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Passau</span> , southern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> , we have a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where there are four thousand Hungarians and two thousand Poles now occupying that." </span><span class="sentence" id="396">He said, "We're going to ship the Hungarians out. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We'll take the Poles and send them to some other...there were thousand of Poles...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish camps</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="398">He said, "We'll turn that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="399">He said, "We'll take all the Jews who live in these little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and put them in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And I blew my top. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">When I walked out, I really pinched myself, saying "Did you dare do it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I talked to these Generals and I said, "Are you guys crazy or nuts?" </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I said, "Number one, you'll have to take every Jew and carry him bodily. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Secondly, I'll have nothing to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Thirdly, I'll let my <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> know in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> what you want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">You're talking about people who came out of...came out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> , and you want: to put them in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Well, they saw my reasoning, but they said, "Joe, we're still going to get rid of the Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">We'll still get rid of the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">We've got to provide <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for the new Jews coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Now, mind you, a lot of these people were not...caught in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="411">They came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , so he suggested that Gene Lipman, Rabbi Lipman and I drive down. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So we drove to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pocking</span> , and we found these Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">It was maddening for me to see these beautiful, well-dressed women with beautiful expensive fur coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">The Hungarians worked for the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And there were Poles there, but we found that this was a huge air base, used by Hermann Goring, with hundreds of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> that had been bombed Installation of lO or 15 thousand people were with <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">halls</span> , and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">The facilities that were there, many of them bombed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">To make a long story short, they got rid of the Hungarians, who I might say took very movable item that they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">They ripped the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">They took the pipes. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">They took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sinks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">They took light fixtures. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">The Army had to rebuild them. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">They got rid of the Poles, who took all the cut wood with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And then we began shipping Jews into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Shortly after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> opened, the General again sent a message to me: wants to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">He said, "Joe, we'll having trouble with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">The Jews are burning <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , which 1s presenting a problem to the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Go down and see what's what." </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So I went down and I...sure enough when the Poles left they took all the wood and the saws and everything else that the Jews were supposed to get, the GIs sold them on the route, and the Jews were freezing so they burned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And they complained; well, we took care of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I might say that two things happened during that visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  Joe, we have to stop right now temporarily because they're gonna take....they finished the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Tape #2
QUESTION:  Joe, we are ready now to recommence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  Can I continue?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  Continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  Now during this trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pocking</span> , I recall several things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Number one, if I haven't mentioned it, I want to say that I took along with me...I brought to this camp Becky Lyons, the nurse who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> sent by the Jewish Agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I called a meeting of all the people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to explain to them that I was working with the military and will see that they will get whatever they need to make life more comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">As we were waiting for this group to get together, I found myself sitting next to a man and little son, about 10 or 11 years old, and I got in a conversation with the man and he told me that he was a partisan. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">You know, through most of the war he lived in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> with his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">His wife was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And I turned to the little boy and I said, "What did you do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="443">He said, "I was a partisanchik." </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I was a little partisan. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And then he said, "The other two kids who were there with me used to join me and at night we'd sneak into the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to steal food." </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And then in Yiddish he said, "If we had to shoot, we shot." </span><span class="sentence" id="447">This was a little kid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  How old about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  About Il, 12 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And then his father said to him in Yiddish, "Show them where they shot you." </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And the kid picked up his sleeve, and he slowed me where he had been shot through the arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">This 1s a little kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">At any rate, I still remember standing on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> with Becky Lyons with me, and when I introduced Becky as coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , the symbol, a living person from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> where they wanted to go, I saw a sea of smiles as she said "Shalom." </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Just that one word, shalom, lit up the faces of the whole crowd. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Another thing that happened that day, I remember, was I found that: there was a transport of about 20 children, the first transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Later on there were hundreds of children brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I'll tell you where they came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And I walked into a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where these kids were sleeping on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattresses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I spoke to the leader called Amadrich, a young girl about 18 years old and I'll never forget when I asked her what I could provide that the kids needed most, and her reply was, "Get me paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Get me pencils. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Maybe books. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">These children have to learn." </span><span class="sentence" id="463">This was the first thing she asked me for. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Well, to end the story of Pocking, I might say that Pocking grew to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with about 6 or 8 thousand Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">You see, Jews were fleeing from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and other parts of Europe into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">United States Zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Since they had not been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , you know, this was better than sleeping <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Children appeared because the Jewish Brigade boys brought them. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">You know, people don't know the story that after the war, members of the Jewish Brigade in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> volunteered to go into Europe to find children, and they went into <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they found Jewish children that were living in <span class="BUILDING">monasteries</span> or whatever, and they brought them into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">United States Zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And that explains why there were so many children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pocking</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470"><span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> threw a large team into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pocking</span> , a Jewish member of the Joint named, I think the first name was Ruth, Fisher. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">F-I-S- H-E-R, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> was the Joint worker in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pocking</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">At any rate, that's the story of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pocking</span> , and at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I have the figures of population....I'll turn it over to the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> ...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pocking</span> by the end of the time I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And one unforgettable thing that happened...I don't know whether I gave it to her for...to show here, but I brought it with me 1s the story of the Barhovich siddur. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Now Moshe Barhovich was the head of the Vad Hadati, extreme organized Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I worked with Moshe. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">To give you an example of the kind of work he did, when a Polish young man whom I helped to become a director opened up a small camp in the middle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> where they took over the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where Hitler trained some of his toughest men for murder, a small camp was opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And I went on the day when the first transport arrived, and Tony did a beautiful job of fixing the <span class="NPIP">place</span> liveable, and within 10 minutes a delegation came to me, saying, "The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is fine, but where 1s the <span class="INT_SPACE">kosher kitchen</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So Tony, as a Polish Catholic, didn't think of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">The army didn't think of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and I didn't mention it. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So I had quite a job to convince the Jews that I'm going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> , and I'll see that everything was sent up within a day or two for a <span class="INT_SPACE">kosher kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">When I came back to my <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> , Moshe...I mean this man Bohovich, was waiting for me, and he wanted to know what about the <span class="INT_SPACE">kosher kitchen</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So I told him the problem I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I found there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , but we gotta go out and buy the pots and pans, and we'll do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">He said, "You give me the money and I'll go out and get it." </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Three hours later. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I looked out of my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and I saw a sight I'll never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">This fellow, Bohovich, and two men with him apparently rented a hugh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> , one of the big ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I looked out of my <span class="DLF">window</span> and there is Bohovich sitting in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , surrounded with pots and pans, came to tell he that he was on the way to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">That night they had their <span class="INT_SPACE">kosher kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">They made a <span class="INT_SPACE">kosher kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Well, at any rate, I think it was Purim, where I went to the services in the makeship synagogue. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Moshe showed up with his two young boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">He had maybe 13 or 14 year-old boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">We had few siddurim, prayer books, and as the service started, Moshe pulled out a siddur, a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And I was sitting next to them, and the three of them, all of them doven, prayed, from this one book. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">After the service I examined the book and I found that it had...I later counted them...148 pages of a hand- printed siddur. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So as to the story of the siddur, which I asked him later to write out, which I have here in Yiddish and I ought to translate into English. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And the story was that he and his family lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zelechow</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">The Germans entered....captured the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and the Poles worked with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">He recalls how the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was destroyed, Torahs they ripped up, and how....he describes in this letter how his daughter and wife and sister and children were killed, mentioned to me that he thought he was among only a handful of survivors of 15,000 Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zelechow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">He had been a partisan, but when the wrote the siddur, he said he was living in hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> of a Pole, who also took advantage of him he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">At any rate, being a former..a pious Jew who worshiped three times a day, fearing that he may die and his boys would not have prayer book to doven, he said I didn't even have <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to stand up because I got...somehow he got paper and ink well and ink and from memory he wrote this siddur, Bohovich siddur. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So I cabled <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and I got the proper paper and I got a hold of a German who made several copies. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I have one copy. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I gave Rabbi Lipman the small copy which the German first experimented and I had another copy which I gave to the archives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , so that it is now in the Yad VaShem. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">My copy was taken by Rabbi Lipman to the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew Union College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">They copied it and it is now in their collection of rare books. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Now this was all in.... Now, after the war when I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I made efforts and I contacted a number of these people: Americans, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I kept on a correspondence and I began looking for Moshe Bohovich. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And one day I wrote to Yivo, you know, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and asked them if they heard about it, and they told me that in the memorial book on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zelechow</span> , you know, after the war there were hundreds of memorial books published by groups to memorialize their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> ...the pictures of the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And they told me if I went to the memorial book on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zelechow</span> , there is something by Moshe Bohovich. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And then they said...they suggested I write to a guy named Kaplan Cohn in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So I wrote to Cohn, and within a week I got a letter from a guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">He said, "I'm Moshe Bohovich. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I understand you're looking for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I live at <span class="DLF">233 Grand Street</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Within a short time, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I met Moshe. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Now because he had two chiLdren, he was among the earliest ones I helped to get the heck out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Of course, I...when he left I assumed he was going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">When I met him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , he told me that he and his children ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Jose</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">He started an <span class="BUILDING">export business</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">By that time, his two sons were grown. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">He had a son with 4, 5 children who was running the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">He spent 4 months in <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span> , 4 months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> , and 4 months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Goodness. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">His other son, Bernado, graduated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , got a degree from <span class="BUILDING">University of Barcelona</span> , was one of the leading attorneys in <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span> ; still practices under the name of Baruch Bohovich Abstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">In <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span> , was represented <span class="COUNTRY">Costa Rica</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">UN</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  We're going to have to hold it for a couple of minutes. [</span><span class="sentence" id="532">Technical pause]
QUESTION:  Hold it. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">We're almost ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Allright:. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Come back to 1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Okay, Joe we are now back on. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Come back to 1950.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">ANSWER:  Now as I say, in the 50s, I met Moshe Bohovich. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">We corresponded. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Since early 70...1n 73, when I first...after I retired, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> and I met him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> where he was living with his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">For a number of subsequent years I'd see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I have this wonderful story about his siddur, and as a Federation Director, I brought many outstanding writers and other peoples to lecture in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Wayne</span> and when they heard the story, their answer was, "Joe, write it. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I'll help you print it in a magazine." </span><span class="sentence" id="546">The old gentleman refused to give me permission until a few years ago when I last saw him and he finally told me why. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">He said that when he was a partisan, the Germans put a price of 100,000 Marks on his head for capture. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">He must have done something to antagonize the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">To make a long story short, he said...told me that he didn't want anything written about him, so that anybody who know where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">At the age of 87, when he knew he didn't have long to live, he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ipala</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , where he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And after his death, his son gave me permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And I wrote the article which was published in the Jewish Spectator. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">The editor, Trudy Weis, who died shortly after the article was published. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So it was the last thing she did was include the article about the Bohovich siddur in the Spectator. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I published the story in the publication of our Indiana Jewish Historical Society. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I didn't mention that I'd been directing the work of the Indiana Jewish Historical Society since 1972. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">So that's the story of the Bohovich siddur. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I brought a picture of the Slota, S-L-O-T-A, family. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">It's worth mentioning because I was in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> when I got a call advising me that there was some Jews from a transport of Germans that were brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I located where they placed these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">It was in an old, abandoned <span class="BUILDING">school house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">When the Germans abandoned <span class="BUILDING">school house</span> , you know, 100 years old, you know, the <span class="DLF">walls</span> were thick and damp, it was cold, and I found 10 Jews in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , where one double <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Slota and two children, Mita and Yana. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">They must have been about 11 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I remember I helped the others and I took this family and got them an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , clothing for the children and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And on my last day...and this was before I left that all this happened, I went to say goodbye to the family and by that time we had a little <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I'll never forget I went to the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> and there were these two little girls with starched dresses, ribbons 1n their hair and they turned to me like a record, both of them, says, "You love me. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Yes?" </span><span class="sentence" id="568">So I bought a picture of this family. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Both of these girls are now mothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">One has 5 children and is a grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">The other has four children. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Leo Slota died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">There is a third beautiful daughter that they had in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and I been in touch with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I want to mention that family because again similar to other stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I had a experience in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Furth</span> , F-U-R-T-H, which is outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">This was just shortly after I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I found that there was a transport of Jews arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Furth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Furth</span> had a...apparently there was a collection of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> used by German slave laborers and I remember being there as these Jews arrived, doling out a cup of soup and potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">The Jews moved into these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Later on, we found that they were in a very unsanitary, unhealthy conditions, so the whole bunch was moved to a place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamberg</span> , camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamberg</span> where the Jews lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I mention to you because an interesting thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">In the '50s, Becky Lyon whom I mentioned, Israeli Nurse, was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I arranged to meet her in a <span class="BUILDING">Greenwich Village Hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">When I called her, she told me that her sister, who was a well known writer, was going to have dinner with us and she said, "I'm gonna have a friend there." </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Well, I came there, called her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and while I was waiting, a gentleman walked up to ne and he said, "Mr. Levine, do you remember me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I looked at the guy, and he looked like a thousand other Polish Jews, and I said, "I really don't." </span><span class="sentence" id="587">He said, "My name is Ignatz Eichler, E-I-C-H-L-E-R. |He says, "You gave me a cup of soup and a piece of bread in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Furth</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Well, he finally came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and he opened an <span class="BUILDING">electrical appliance store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Becky had helped him and tn gratitude he shipped over a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">appliances</span> and we were joined by the two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">We went to a wonderful <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> on <span class="DLF">14th Street</span> ...no, <span class="DLF">12th Street</span> , where there were these singing waiters and the chorus from the Metropolitan Opera was there, and there was wonderful singing and Ignatz insisted to pay the bill. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">After that dinner, then we went to...I forget the name of a well known <span class="BUILDING">nightclub</span> where Molly Lyons Bar David, Becky's sister, met a well known American writer. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">He was crippled and in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheel chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I forget his names. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">We were there til 3 o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Ignatz insisted on paying. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I was glad that he was able to do it, but... That's the memories of Furth. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Uh...As I said, most of my time was spent traveling with the problems of the Jews and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I am just giving you some of the highlights of things that happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Uh...I talked...I talked about the death marches. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I should mention that I have photographs for myself dedicating monuments. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">After a while, the Jews, under some law, had the Germans erect monuments. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">So I brought a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">You will have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">How they placed...that's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I have pictures of a place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ergoldsbach</span> , a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where the Jews put up a series of monuments and this was the dedication service. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I was one of the speakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Another one was a professor from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , Jew who had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">This was a dedication of 78...where 78 people were killed on the last day before the survivors walked into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ergoldsbach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And this happened in a number of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Now...
QUESTION:  You mentioned something about...wanting to talk about Nuremberg Trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I will talk about Nuremberg Trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I want to say too that the Jews, as I mentioned earlier, came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where they were highly organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> , they already formed a Central Committee to work with all these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">The Central Committee also worked with the large committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">See, there was a Committee of Liberated Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> , they had the Central Committee of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niederbayern</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oberpfalz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">That was the name of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">From the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">It's amazing the set of committees, they had assignments made. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">They had a lot of battles too. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">There were a lot of fights for power, because if you are committee man you have power to distribute funds and food which the Joint provided. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">So that there was a lot of times spent through the local committee, some sad things happened as well as good things happened, working with them.. I want to...Let me close with two stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Number one, I say I got talk about the Joint Distribution Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">The people should know. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">The Joint Distribution Committee was a Jewish American relief agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">The major food did not come from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">They came from <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> and the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">We supplemented. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">We supplemented with money to enable...enable the people to buy stuff that they needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I think to illustrate the meaning of the Joint people, I want to tell a story how in January of 1946, there was the first Conference of Liberated Jews in Europe, called in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Ironically, it was held in the <span class="BUILDING">Rathaus</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Everything around it was kaputt. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Delegates from <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , French, <span class="REGION">American zones</span> lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">straw mattress camps</span> came to this conference, and the great of the world came. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">On Sunday morning, I was way up on the top of the rafter. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I wanted...I didn't want to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> from these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">A little man appeared on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> I wasn't an ardent Zionist; I was interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I didn't know the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And speaking in Yiddish at one point, he turned to them, he waved his fist, and his white hair flew around and he said in Yiddish, "You cannot remain, nor will you remain in this hated <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">You cannot return to blood covered <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> where the millions have died. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Or <span class="COUNTRY">Rumania</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And he waved his fist and he said in Yiddish, "There's one little tiny piece of <span class="REGION">land</span> in this world where," in Yiddish he said, "your brothers and sisters are willing to share their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , their food." </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And he waved his arm again, "If we have to fight and die to bring you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eretz</span> , we'll do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="645">This <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> was electrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Electrified! </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And as I drove...we drove back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> in that cold and in an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> , Moshe drove me back, I tried to analyze what happened there and I decided that the most important thing that happened was that Ben Gurion let them know they're not alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And I'm using this story to point out that that was the role of the Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">We Were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">There was somebody represented American Jewry to help, and that was exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Just one or two other things, two stories and I'll quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">My experience in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> at the Nuremberg trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Streicher’, the worst...one of the worst of the Nazi had a magnificent <span class="BUILDING">mansion</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">It was taken over and made into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And I should say that before long young Jews began to marry, as if they're going to let the world know we're going to make more Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Interesting, there was a number of marriages going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And there was a wedding in <span class="BUILDING">Streicher's home</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> and me being the Director of the Joint...they had no father, so I was...you know like the...whatever it was...the guy...the substitute father. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">So I attended that wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">The next morning we drove to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and two things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">We came to an <span class="REGION">area</span> where we saw blocks and blocks with piles of cut marble. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">We suddenly came to a...what looked like an <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to a huge <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">We drove into this <span class="DLF">field</span> that we drove around, just two Jews 1n a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I learned later that all that marble was cut for Hitler's monument he was going to erect to last a thousand years. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And later that I learned that we were on that <span class="DLF">field</span> that you've seen on television where Hitler addressed a quarter of a million Germans, in that <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="665">That was one thing that happened that morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Then we passed, what I discovered, was the <span class="BUILDING">Court of Justice</span> where the Nuremberg Trial was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">So I said "Moshe, stop." </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I was in uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I had a revolver which I carried all through my time, walked in and I talked to a Colonel at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and I asked whether I'd be admitted into the trial and he said, "Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Of course, you could." </span><span class="sentence" id="671">So I went out and gave my gun to Moshe. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Oh yes, took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> in the front row. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">On my left, incidentally, when I went 1n I bought a chart how they sat, was where the prisoners sat on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">When I got there, they were still standing around with briefcases, papers, I think it was the board of directors of the <span class="BUILDING">Chase National Bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">In walked Hermann Goring and Hess. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I saw a little Beispiel’: one or two guys turned their back to Hess, to Goring. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Others clicked their heels, bowed and shook hands with Goring. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Five minutes later, <span class="BUILDING">court</span> was called to order, so these men took their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Hermann Goring who sat in the front row facing me, took a huge blanket and wrapped it around his big fanny, sat down and dropped his head and throughout the Trial looked like he feel asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Sitting next to him was Hess, and he had a lot of papers and he kept on writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Nobody was paying any attention to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I remember Schacht’ staring at something at the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> all though this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">You know, the top, except Bormann and Hitler and the little guy, whatever his name was..
QUESTION:  Gobbels.</span></p>

one little thing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weiden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I talked about a Nuremberg Trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">At any rate before I left, I was told that they were going to have what 1s called a banquet to say farewell to Joe Levine. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I forget where it was, but when I came to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> where delegates from every community came to say farewell to Joe Levine. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">It was like my living wake. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I sat through hours listening to the Rabbi, to every President of every community had to get in the act. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">You can't ignore them, president of the committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">The chairman of the cultural committees started to get in the act. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">At any rate, we had lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">We continued and the total length of the affairs, Chaim Diamond whom I mentioned...he was the president of the Central Committee at that time, bent down an picked up a piece of paper, cardboard. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I brought it. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">You have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And he turned to me and said, "Levine, you...now you know about...appreciate...how we feel about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">We want to give you something as a token of...to remember us. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And he gave me this diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">They went to German and in a broken English expressed their appreciation and made me what I think the only non-Holocaust survivor a honorary member of the Central Committee of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Niedrbayern</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oberpfalz</span> , typical German with four signatures and stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">One name was Chaim Diamond; the other was Silverberg, the editor of the Moment; the other name was Steven Schwartz from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Straubing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">These were officials from the Central Committee, and a man named Schachler. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Years later...I don't know if I described how I met Chaim. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Did I?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">ANSWER:  Well, in 56 I learned that Chaim Diamond was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I was at a meeting on <span class="DLF">38th street</span> and Rabbi Lipman gave me a note: "had lunch yesterday with Chaim." </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I said "Where?" </span><span class="sentence" id="743">He said, "<span class="DLF">545 Fifth Avenue</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Two minutes later, there's Levine running up <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I had a wonderful reunion with Chaim. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">At that time he was married and his, brother was with him, he had a successful watch business. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Chaim and I have been friends ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Now what was I talking about before? </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I forget.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">QUESTION:  You were talking about the certificate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">So Chaim opened his <span class="INT_SPACE">vault</span> during our meeting and he showed me copies of all the letters I wrote and he was arrested by an American town major because he objected to the anti-semitic signs. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I had to go to General McNarney's <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to get him out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">At any rate, we were talking about papers and he came...we talked about the diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So he said, "Joe, I want you to know that before the meeting I met with the Committee and we discussed what can we give Levine as a token of appreciation?" </span><span class="sentence" id="756">So one man suggested, "Let's give him a diamond ring." </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Now some of the Jews...I didn't say it, but were on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and doing very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">A lot of these Jews were in the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> business in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war, so it's nothing new. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Another one said, "Let's give him a Leica with all the lenses." </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Another said, "Let's give him money." </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Finally, somebody said, "Let's give him something that no money can buy that he can hand down to his children." </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And how right he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">So that diploma which you have here...I gave you a copy of it, 1s what they gave me, which I treasure as a memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">QUESTION:  Okay, we have about 5 more minutes if you think of anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">ANSWER:  Well, while I'm here I want to talk about the fact that I'm delighted that the United States Memorial the United States Holocaust Memorial is being built. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">The world shouldn't forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I'm deeply appreciative of the fact that I was asked to make what little contribution I cam make on this program. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I hope to turn over... turned over some materials...some more materials for the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Uh...The world has to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">The world shall not forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And I certainly feel that the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> will render an important...make an important contribution to the world in the coming years.</span></p>
