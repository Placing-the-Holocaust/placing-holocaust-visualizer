<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  It's Beno Helmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I was born August 21st, 1923, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Teplitz-Schénau</span> [Czech: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Teplice-Sanov</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">It's in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Actually, it's in Sudetenland. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">You know, it's... And I come from a family of three children, my parents, my grandparents, bunch of aunts, uncles, lot of cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">As a matter of fact, my mother's family--all of them--settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Teplice-Sanov</span> after the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And my father was a poor refugee who just happen to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Teplice</span> , just to look for a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And fell in love with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And the rest of this is history.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Tell me about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Teplice</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Teplice</span> was a very good <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I mean, I grew up there; went to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And what's amazing about it is, I never encountered anti...antisemitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I mean, I never knew, even... Matter of fact, I never even knew I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Because I didn't know Judaism is a connotation with a religion, or anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So I was Jew by religion, but it was not part of my personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I must have been, maybe, 11 or 12 years old and my best friend ... His name is--I shan't forget--his name was Egon. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And as we playing in our <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> ... Because I...my father build me cages for rabbits. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And I had so many rabbits. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So during this play-thing, or whatever it was, he says to me, "Beno, my father says this you are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Are you Jewish?" </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And I said to him, "I don't know." </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Because I never realized, as he asked my religious affiliation, or 1t was a part of a playing thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And 1s the last time I saw Egon. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And never saw Egon since; and he was a very good friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And I always asked my parents what is the reason, how come I didn't see Egon. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">They never told me why. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And I lost Egon. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And this was...and as a childhood was quite a good one until it was getting bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , I couldn't go to anymore; so I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Tell us about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and what you did there as a young man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  At...at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , this was at that time the capital. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">It was almost like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">It was a very lively, very vivacious <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Not for me, because...uh...fmancially, I couldn't afford anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But it was fairly good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Even in poverty, it was fairly good enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And through...I don't know...circumstances, I got a job in the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I played in extras. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I met S. S. Cuddles. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I think here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , they called him S. S. Cuddles. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Actually, his name is S. S. Sagal. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I made two movies with him...with him; and a actress at that time which was very, very popular in Europe--[Barsa Nirosi (ph)|. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">By the way, the reason also I got the job 1s because I was at that time bilingual. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So the movies, at that time, were made in Hungarian and in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So I could speak both languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So when we took one take, I didn't have to change roles. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I could stay in the same role for the German take and for the Hungarian take. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And...and plus we played with Hans Virbis (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He's supposed to make a picture with Martha Eggar, except at that time she fell in love with Jan Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And she came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and she left the Jan Kippur in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And...and this was my youth, 'til my parents came...also came to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ; and it was getting... because <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> became very unpleasant at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And...uh...
QUESTION:  What was happening to your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Uh...My parents came and tried to settle in..in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">They felt this maybe in Hungarian, because at that time Horthy was more fascistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So they felt that maybe Hitler's gonna spare <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And plus, my father had a older brother living in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And he couldn't get any...in that between <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , it was not very pleasant circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">There were already talking about war rumbling. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So...uh...1t was very rough, and my father couldn't get the papers to, uh...couldn't get papers to become a citizen or...or allowed to be stayed...allowed to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So, through some acquaintances, my mother knew Mr. Beck. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I think... think Beck was at that time Foreign Minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> .’ </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And she went to his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and she bribed him quite--I don't know, let's call it bribe--when she gave him a tremendous amount of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">At that time, this was a big money for us; because it's all what my parents almost had. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And after this, she gets an invitation and my father gets an invitation to a dinner which is in honor of Mr. Beck. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So they were very elated, because they thought this gonna be the chance that he'd finally...he'd gonna give a...the papers which they needed to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So during the conversation... During this dinner, he knocked on the glass; and he says, "I have another question to ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I want to ask Mr. Helmer how come he gave me this tremendous amount of money." </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So it's a good thing that my father said, "I'm giving it to the Hungarian Red Cross." </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And with this sentence, he lost all his money. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Because Mr. Beck didn't take the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">The Hungarian Red Cross got the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And my parents were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And it was my parents, my brother and my sister; and they were deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Because they had a chance to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">You had a chance to go to any <span class="DLF">border</span> they choose; and they choose <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And shortly after this, I was deported also. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Matter of fact, I shall never forget; I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from a movie which I saw--Modern Times, with Charlie Chaplin. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">This was the movie I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ; and they woke me up during the night and arrested me. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And they deported me to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And I wound up in the city of od_. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Always almost exactly the Friday before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So we stayed in somebody's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I don't know who it was, where it was <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">By that time, the German war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I think it's October Ist, 1939.” </span><span class="sentence" id="92">The occupation was immediate. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We couldn't escape anyplace, anyways. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And, uh...because of financial difficulties, at that time was nothing left. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So...because a lot of people escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So we found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in _6d_ on...in a <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Matter of fact, it was...the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> was so low that I don't think we ever...
QUESTION:  I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I can't hear you. ' </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Istvan Csaky was Foreign Minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> from 1938-1941. ; </span><span class="sentence" id="100"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in September 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  The <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> was very low. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">This was on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , underneath the <span class="DLF">roof</span> ; so we couldn't even stand up. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So we only could stand up where the pitchwork came together. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Otherwise, we always had to hunch over. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And it was...the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> consisted of one double <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and a big basket--like, uh...like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamer trunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And this where...all our possessions were in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamer trunk</span> ; and that's the place where I slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Because all four of them slept in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And just when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed, this was part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">This <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> was part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , od_ <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So we didn't have to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We stayed there, which was uh dire circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , which was four story down in...in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">No water, which we had to carry in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pails</span> all the way up to...four flights. </span><span class="sentence" id="114"><span class="INT_SPACE">Bed chambers</span> [NB: chamber pots] at night time, and emptying. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It was horrible circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And couple of weeks after, my father was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">No, I'm...I'm... I have to retract. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I have to retract a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Before we went in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , before the Germans came, my father went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And he was joined the underground in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ; and got himself a job through his brother-in- law, through my uncle, in an <span class="BUILDING">insurance company</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">In a big <span class="BUILDING">insurance company</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And he changed his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">He got papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">His name was Pollack. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Mr. Pollack, a widower with two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And he...he was quite active in the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">In one of the newsletters--the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> newsletters--there was a letter written as...as...a letter to the newspaper, or a letter to the editor. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It says, "How come there is a man here with allegedly two...a widower with alleged two children, but we feel he's here under different circumstances?" </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So he felt this letter was written about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So he packed up; and through the underground he... They gave him money to smuggle it out of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , to bring it to...to smuggle it out of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Smuggling what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  Money. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Cash for the underground, to be...underground in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So they gave him money. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So he got money belts around him and he... Plus the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">The shoes was...instead of leather, the...they stuff--all the big denominations they stuffed in in the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And plus, wherever they could, they taped money to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And they smuggled him to back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Except, on the <span class="DLF">border</span> they caught him. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And they caught him...and not only... This was not the German who caught him; it was the Polish who caught him. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">They took all his money away. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Everything take his money away from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Only thing they didn't find was the money in his shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And they sent him back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So when he was back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , he smuggled himself back--finally lucky--back to...to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Because of this...all this walking what he did, he rubbed his soles through. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And matter of fact, the cash he had had holes in it because of...of the walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So, actually, the money was...was worthless, or much less worth than 1t was supposed to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And he stayed in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krak</span> ...uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And after this, there was a struggle between the fraction [NB: faction] of the underground; between the Russian fraction and the English fraction. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So anyways he came and joined us in_6d_. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And this where finally the war caught on. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We wind up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , which was 28
QUESTION:  Tell us about...tell us about life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , in addition to the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">What was your daily life like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  Now, our daily life was...uh... I mean, the daily life was...uh...the daily life was--not only us and everybody else--was to...to find food. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">The struggle was to find food; because we were constantly hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I mean, hunger was the pri...primary requisite just of survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And...and the only thing...I mean, to compensate hunger, we were drinking water. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I mean, water's fine, fills the stomach; but you're still hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So Father got a job to supply groceries. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">You know, whatever was there, to certain outlets which was giving the...the...which were giving out. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So...so sometime he gets a little bit more flour; because that's all what he was delivering-- flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So we had a little bit more flour; so Mother used to make a paste and make something like a Matzah or something out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I don't know what she did about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I left quite early in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I already got a job...or 1942, I got a job from a man--name is Goodman. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And he got me a job outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I was working for...for...for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So what was...I was working in a...because I was studying architecture. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So they needed some kind of <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">So they took a forced labor out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so we should work 1n the...in the...in the construction there. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Since I had a so-called background of two days, so...so (laughing) so they made me in charge of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">But what's only good about it was this: they gave us a half a loaf of bread coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So we sustained ourself, at least, with this half a loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Mother sliced...sliced it very thinly, or she made bread...uh...soup out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">She boiled water and put the bread in it; and that's all what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It's bread soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Except it was expanded so much, it became more filling. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And it was...I mean, uh...plus I mean that what's bad about it was 1s also bodies...lot of bodies all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Wherever you went, you saw bodies dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And it's becomes part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">You know, [the] first two, three or four, you find them as a shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But later, you find them...it's...you gets quite used to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It's...it's...1t's like part of your nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I mean, you just see a body and you disassociate yourself completely from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It's...1t's...1t's...1t's completely somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">It's...it's has nothing to do with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Filth was also tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Filth. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">It was filthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">It was filth even the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I mean, in the winter time. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I mean, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> was...1t was...1t was ice. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">It was all ice; and then the feces and the urine all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Was overflowing...overflowing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And...and sometime, they took you to forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I mean, one incident happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They...they took us into a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">The German came and they...they lined everybody up. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">They lined everybody up. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And there was...you know this was like in a semi-circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">You were standing in a semi-circle; and there was a lady there with a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And, uh...(deep sigh) (deep sigh) And he ask, "Whose, this child?" </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And the woman who was the mother, she did not admit the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So he took the child by the legs, and he swung it against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And he killed the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And I looked at the mother;

So he threw me. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So he kicked me into this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">This was, oh...uh, he kicked me in the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Only because I forgot to say, "Thank you." </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Coming back to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> at that time, I don't know what, he made me his cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I don't know anything about cooking at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">But he had provisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">He got potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">He got extra this--not what we used to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Not the food we used to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">So I don't know anything about cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">So only thing he said, he likes sauerbraten or some kind of vinegar. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So whatever soup--I only made soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">So whatever soup, I finished the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Before I served him, I took a tablespoon full of vinegar and put the vinegar into the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And he thought I was the most gourmet cook in the world, (laughing) because I made...I added vinegar to his...to his soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And I always looked for details, details where I could get out of this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ...camp site to go to other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ; because I was looking for my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And specially, I'm looking for my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I thought he...if anybody gonna survive it, it's gonna be my brother gonna survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So I got details...uh, cleaning toilets. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I got a detail becoming--whatever gypsies were left, I became interpreter to the Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Only because I spoke Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I faked my Hungarian, they faked their Rumanian; so we somehow understood each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And I always gave the answers--which I felt 1t was good--is what the German wanted to hear, instead of what the Gypsies said to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">But there were few of them left, already; because most of them perished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  Tell us about the Gypsies you met. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">What were they like, and what were they doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">ANSWER:  Now, I met Gypsies in the...1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> , they were bewildered. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">They were bewildered. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Not only...they felt themself a minority of a minority. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">So...so ...so they felt alienated, even among the camp survivors--uh, camp prisoners there, they felt alien. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So they kept as a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So they tried to shut their personality as much as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ladies camp</span> --this was a phenomena which was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">They became--some of them became--in charge of...of the block...charge of the...the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> in itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And it's amazing thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">They assumed a manly personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">They used to do like this (rubbing chin), which a woman very seldom does. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">When they stood, they stood feet spread, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">They...they became...they became a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Maybe they...through being this manly personality, they became more assertive, or more... Became leaders of their particular group. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So...so I think the men behaved more passively as...as the Gypsy ladies. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">The men became more passive than...than... than the women were. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Anyways, I went and I never found anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Never found anybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>

"</span><span class="sentence" id="636">I should...I went left, but they told me to go right. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I should have gone right, because maybe right would be better than going left." </span><span class="sentence" id="638">This way, matter of fact, I dropped personal responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I dropped my responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I don't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">They tell me, I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">So one day, he comes in and the people come there with thing, and they stamp me. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">The stamp is right here on the chest; with a big black stamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">So it gives stamp; the stamp, I don't know what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">So he says, "Anybody who's stamped has to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buna</span> , to the <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I said, "For coal mining, I don't... gonna test fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I'm not going where fate's going to send me." </span><span class="sentence" id="648">So I went and I tried to rub it off but I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">The stamps seems like were very quite embedded, so I couldn't rub it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">So I went behind a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and I got dirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And I rubbed my chest with dirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">So problem was this: my chest became, you know, raw. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">It's became here raw. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">So I was scared they should recognize that I...[ have a raw spot, that I rubbed off the stamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">So I rubbed all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Wherever I found a little <span class="NPIP">spot</span> , I rubbed this dirt into it, too; that I should have the same blotches which I had here, I should have it all over my body. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And I met a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Not a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I met a man--by his name of Monyek Ravel, the same as the composer-- and we became friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And we decided whatever [we] do, we shall try to do it together. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So whatever happen, let's...let's stick it together. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">At least I...1 had somebody, I had a human being with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">It was the most bewildering thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I was quite young at that time, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I was not the old...youngest one, but I was not one of the masses that were older than we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And...and because it was getting very rough...
