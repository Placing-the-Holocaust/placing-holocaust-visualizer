<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">QUESTION:  And tell me, did you meet up with survivors when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  No, no, because I, | stepped into Jim's kind of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Jim worked for NBC, | worked for, for a company on <span class="DLF">Madison Avenue</span> , you know, a <span class="BUILDING">French office</span> and most of the people we saw were Jim's friends or the people we made friends with at work. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">By and large it was a crowd of reporters, television people, radio people, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Advertising people and mostly people like that and maybe some people whom Jim had known as a child, because in fact | had met a couple of, of people he had gone to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> with and | became extremely friendly with one young woman who had gone to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> with him, who stayed my best friend until she died a couple of years ago, you know, they lived in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> , but that was a couple who was extremely close to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">So | started making friends amongst the Americans, but | did not see any survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">| don't think survivors search out other survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">| think, particularly in my case, | wanted a normal life and | wanted to step into a normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">| didn't want to live in the past, | didn't want to talk about what happened to me and in fact | very seldom talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Most of our friends didn't know | was a Holocaust survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">As far as they knew | cam from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and that was it, | was learning the language, | was learning the customs, | was becoming Americanized, but they did not know | was a Holocaust survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">In fact Jim knew very little about it, he knew, but | never talked about it and he didn't quiz me about it, so | very seldom talked about it and | did not search out any other Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">However, a very funny thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Jim was very politically inclined always and | began to get, to take an interest in politics and we went to a Stevenson rally once in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span> , a huge rally and | looked across the <span class="BUILDING">arena</span> and | saw a young girl and | said, | know this person, | knew her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So we went up and | said, "Are you Blanca(ph)? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Blanca Bruner(ph)?" </span><span class="sentence" id="17">and she said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">| hadn't seen her in like what, 10, 11 years and she was just as amazed as | was that | had recognized and she recognized me too, so we sort of started contact and | wanted to see her and she called me up and she told me that her father forbade her to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And | said, "Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="20">He doesn't know me." </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And she said, "yes, that's just it." </span><span class="sentence" id="22">They were very Orthodox Jews and they didn't mix with any other Jews and she was not allowed to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So the only one | could have had contact with, her father cut it off, he absolutely forbade her to see me, because | was not a practicing Orthodox Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So that was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So to answer your question, | did not see any Holocaust survivors, | did not talk about it very often, | didn't read about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">| really concentrated all my energies on adapting myself to a normal life in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and | think | succeeded pretty well, so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Did you ever, at any point, feel that you were missing something, or was it just kind of, you just wanted to put that in the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Was there a part of you that was curious, wanted that sort of bond or was it lonely? </span><span class="sentence" id="29">| was just...
ANSWER:  Yes, there were times when it was lonely, but it was also amusing, like | would have a friend who would sit over coffee with me and cry that she had an identity crisis and here | was, | didn't know my name, | didn't know my age, | didn't know where | came from and | felt, well, I'm not any worse off then she is. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">She's having an identity crisis? </span><span class="sentence" id="31">| don't think, you know, | don't think I'm any worse off. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">At least | don't know, you know, it's a clean slate. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So yes, | did feel at times lonely, because nobody | knew could share with me what I'd gone through, but at the same time | thought, it gave me a certain perspective where more trivial things didn't bother me the same way as they seemed to bother my friends, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Many of them were bothered that they didn't have, they were hoping that their careers would have been more advanced and they were busy at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the kids and they couldn't do this and they couldn't do that and they were very bothered. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It didn't bother me to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">It's true that | worked until the kids were born. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">| tried, | had a very good job when | was pregnant with Laura and | would have liked to go back to it, but by then | was working for the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> and | had a very good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">| was working for the ambassador from <span class="COUNTRY">Laos</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> , you know, one of the IndoChinese countries, French speaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">| had a very good job, | mean | worked until two weeks before she was born and they wanted me back and | started negotiating and they wanted me full time and | knew | couldn't walk out of there at five o'clock and yet | had a child and | couldn't see myself leaving the child, so | decided not to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So | made the decision voluntarily and | somehow didn't feel that | was being penalized in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So | had advantages that others didn't have, in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And then, before | even had time to turn around and feel that oh my goodness, what am | going to do with my life now that the children are going to start <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , Jim said, "We are starting a business.". </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And so when my son went off to <span class="BUILDING">Kindergarten</span> for half a day, | went off to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">In fact | had to rush back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to greet him because he only had half a day of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So | never had some of the problems that | could see my friends had. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">| had my set of problems because | had hang-ups because of my past, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But, like for instance, you know, taking care of the children, | was always very concerned that they should not catch cold and when they were sick | felt sick and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I'm sure that my American counterparts didn't feel that to the same degree as | did. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The anxiety over children, particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">But on the other hand, they had other anxieties which | didn't have, so | felt I'm not doing too badly, okay, so that's how | felt about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  You said earlier, in another interview, that you didn't tell your children, so?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  No, | thought that and | think probably | made a mistake, because | didn't speak about it, they knew | was foreign, yeah | was French, but then, when our kids were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , there were several kids in classes that my daughter had, who had French parents, so that wasn't an oddity, that much of an oddity for her and | didn't feel | wanted to burden them. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">First of all, | felt uncomfortable myself talking about it and secondly | was very concerned not to overburden the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So | didn't talk about it and it's only when our daughter was going to <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> , she came back, want to stop it? </span><span class="sentence" id="55">She came back one day and apparently they had been discussing the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">You know there was a period where the Holocaust wasn't discussed to the same degree that it is being discussed now. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">There is an awareness now which | don't think existed at the time when | came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> and she asked me am | a Holocaust survivor and | said, "yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And she was so upset. "</span><span class="sentence" id="60">Why didn't you ever tell me anything about it, why didn't you say anything about it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And | realized that | had made a mistake, she was truly upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And from then on she just kept on digging and asking questions and this and that and | realized that | had to do an about face and face the past and come to terms with it myself, but particularly for the sake of my children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  How old were you at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  Well, let's see, Laura was born when | was 25 and at that point she must have been 11. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">About 36, 37.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  How did you, in your own way, come to terms with it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  | started reading about it, because | started, | started to, trying to put some chronological order into my memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And that's when | started talking to Jim, but mostly to female friends, | had always very close female friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">| had a couple in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> who were very close to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And so when | was ready to talk, they were listening, you know and they were always ready to listen, so | would discuss certain matters. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And with Jim, too and try to put some chronological order into my memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">At that point, Jim became very helpful because he started getting me books and | would tell him recollections and then he would find books and he would say, "Your recollections are correct." </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Like | would have recollections about what happened in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> after we escaped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and he found a book, | don't remember what it is, we have a library of them by now. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And sure enough, it described almost the way | had described to him what it was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Those bands, you know, of deserters and Jewish people hiding and children and this and that and it was very accurate, so | knew that my memory wasn't playing tricks. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">That's the way | was trying to, you know, to deal with the, and | was able to sort of make some order out of what had happened, by talking about it and then reading up and confirming that my memories were actually accurate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Did you ever join, were there survivor groups, did you ever, after that experience in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , did you meet up with anyone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">As a matter of fact | have a very good friend who lives in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , who is also a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">She had a somewhat different path than mine, in that she was with her mother and her brother all through it, and then emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Venezuela</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">When they left Europe, they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Venezuela</span> , so she is sort of Latin American in her outlook because she went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and then she came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and she called me once that there was a group of hidden children that was meeting and | should join them and | wasn't ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">| just absolutely refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">She went to this meeting, they had written, they wrote a book, somebody at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , | think a woman at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , who does a lot of research in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , put together a book of the recollections of the hidden children and my friend was part of it and she sent me the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">You know, | read her part, | couldn't read the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">| just didn't feel | wanted to go back and dwell on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">| just couldn't read the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And so | understood that | really wasn't ready to join that group and to share in great detail and just dwell that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">That's not my, my nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">My nature is to look ahead and | can't look, | only looked back as far as | needed to to put some order into it and to sort of present it to my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But | don't think | want to dwell any more on that than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  When you say dwell, is it some of the pain and the experience of it that scares you to go back? </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Describe sort of what's going on in your head.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Well, of course there's pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">There's pain, there's fear, you know, there's an enormous amount of fear and you start thinking of how, what a terrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> the world is and it's very hard to get up in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">In fact | had that experience when the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> opened and my husband Jim thought that it would be a good idea if we went together with our children. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">By then both our children were married, so there were six of us going over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">| think for my kids it was a good experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">For me, | came back and it did something. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">For a week | couldn't function. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">| couldn't get up in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And | didn't really Know why, except | kept on crying and | was having myself a depression, which | am not prone to usually, | try, you Know, whenever there are things that used to bubble up to the surface, | would always, either call a friend, or do something constructive or read a good book and get myself away from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">But going through the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> put me into a depression where | had difficulty pulling myself out of. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So what really scares me about dwelling too much on the past is that it does create a bitterness. [</span><span class="sentence" id="104">end of side one of tape one]
QUESTION:  So, where were we? </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Okay, you were saying why you didn't want to dwell on it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Yeah, | think it's depressing to dwell on it, it's very depressing to me, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So | would rather not dwell on it, | would rather look at the life I'm leading now and to my future, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So | guess I'm finished with that thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  How did you pull yourself out of it at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  | think | got the help from friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">| have, | have the most incredible circle of friends and they were calling all the time and they were checking up on me and they were suggesting things we should be doing and they were bringing me books and | started reading again and | started getting involved in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">You know, life is irresistible, it's, if you start getting involved in it, it just carries you along and that's what you need to do and that's really what | did to pull myself out of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  All right, let's go back for a moment, you were talking about the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We had gotten to the point where | believe you were going to sell it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  Yes, sell it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Okay, so let's start up at that point and then the following years after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Right, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So we decided to sell the business mainly because my husband, my husband's health at that point was a little shaky and he, it was, he was really suffering from extreme exhaustion, so we decided to sell the business, but it's not so easy to sell a business like that and it took about a year to complete the sale. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And then we were staying on for awhile because it was part of our contract, so we stayed on for awhile, but then we, Jim just wanted no part of it any more, he wanted to get out of it, so we renegotiated out, we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> to renegotiate his contract and we left the business in very good shape, you know, with very good people are there running it and it's still in excellent, it's a very good business that they bought themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And then we had about a year to decide, you know, to clean up all the paperwork from the sale and the distribution of, to all the employees and all of that and then we decided to do a little bit of traveling and | think just about that time, our son went off to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , so the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">nest</span> was really empty and he teases us, funny because for my 60th birthday, he gave us a whole speech, you know, they gave me a party and he made a speech and he said when he went off to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , he had the impression that this is the moment we were waiting for, really, because our bags must have been packed, because the minute he went off to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , off we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And we did a lot of traveling, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I'm trying to remember, | know we made a trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , but that was still for business, this was, we did one last piece of business for the, for the company which we sold and we had some contracts with Japanese publishers and we had to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , so we did that, which was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And we went to Europe, we traveled with friends, with our friends from <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> , you know, whom Jim has known since <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We went to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> with them, we took a trip to the south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We had other friends we were traveling with. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We went to, we went to <span class="REGION">Alaska</span> , we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">New Zealand</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">We really did quite a bit of traveling and | love to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And we enjoy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We usually go with friends, one or two couples. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We went to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> just recently, we went to <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> last May. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So we have done quite a bit of traveling, but the first year we really did a lot of traveling, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you know, going to the <span class="REGION">west coast</span> , doing just more, <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , more local things. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And then we decided to open a different kind of <span class="BUILDING">publishing house</span> because Jim's ambition was always to be a publisher of books, not of specialized material like we had just sold, but of trade books. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So we started Adler and Adler publishers. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And we ran that company for a couple of years and we published some 46 or 48 books. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And that was entirely different ball game. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It was very interesting because | started doing editing, which | had never done before and | really liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But after awhile, you know, we noticed that the book business, the climate had changed, it was very difficult to sell books and particularly the kind of books we liked, you know, literary books, serious books, they weren't selling easily, it was very difficult to market them. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So we decided to phase it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">But by then | had become involved in community work. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">| became associated with the Arena Stage, | don't know if you are familiar with the <span class="BUILDING">Arena Stage Theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">| got on the board of the Arena Stage and | was very active there. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We, both Jim and | joined Jewish organizations, like American Jewish Committee and we became very active, in fact Jim is now President, just became President of the Washington chapter of AJC. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And | got on the board of the Capital Children's Museum, | became very friendly with the director there, Ann Lewin(ph) and for awhile | was quite active there, although I'm not active now, even though they still Keep my name on the board, | hardly go to meetings any more and | really sort of became very much involved in community affairs of that sort, you know, particularly in the arts. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I'm also on the board of the opera, so you know, | go to the opera a lot, | go to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> a lot and as a consequence of being on those boards, particularly the Arena Stage, we made a lot of friends who are similarly inclined, who love the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , you know, so there's a whole group of us who love the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and who play tennis and we play tennis and travel and we travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We just went with two of the couple to, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So we, we really have become more involved in the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We still have an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and some of the books are still being sold, but | don't need to go in there because my <span class="REGION">area</span> was more acquiring books, dealing with agents and editing and we are not acquiring new books, so it's just a matter of running the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and make sure that some of the books that are still selling are being reprinted and sold. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So my husband goes into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , but | do not. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And we're very much involved in the community, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and such. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So that's really what our lives are like right now. (</span><span class="sentence" id="151">pause). </span><span class="sentence" id="152">All right, we have two children, yeah | think we should, | want to talk a little bit about the children now, we have two children, we have a daughter Laura, who is 35 years old and we have a son Eric, who is 31 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Our daughter lives in this <span class="REGION">area</span> and she is married and she has two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">| have a six year old granddaughter and a almost two year old grandson and they live in this <span class="REGION">area</span> and | see them often, so, you know, | also, this is something | really enjoy, seeing my grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">| think probably my past has affected my children, but it is very hard for me to evaluate in what way. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">When | look at our son, who was married, is divorced now, who came out of, from <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , he went to Swathmore(ph) and started teaching because he got married like three weeks after he got out of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and he needed a job so he started teaching and who has just changed his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">He decided a year ago to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so he is now at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wharton</span> and he is going in for a business degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">In fact, this weekend, we were in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> visiting with him because he had asked us to come and sit in on a day of his classes, which is extremely interesting, it's some <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wharton</span> , it really is. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Very high-powered and the people, the young people, they are very bright, very quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It's really, it's satisfying to see so many intelligent and quick-witted people who are going to be, you know, running our business world. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">| think it's sort of satisfying. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">He seems, | don't think anybody could tell that he is a survivor, that he is the child of a survivor of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">| don't think he was affected by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">He has his problems like everybody else has their problems and he has his areas of tensions, I'm sure, but | would say that, touching wood, Eric functions as an extremely well-adjusted and happy individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Our daughter | think, bore more of the brunt of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Maybe it's because she's more sensitive and she digs around in the past more. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">She's very interested in what do you call it, in family trees and things like that and | could not provide her _____ knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">| could not provide her with a family background, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">| think it bothered her always, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="170">But she married somebody from the midwest, who has a very long lineage, which can be documented and goes all the way back to <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> , he's a Scotch man and so she's perfectly happy and she digs around in his <span class="ENV_FEATURES">family trees</span> and that keeps her happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">With her | think that she, she bore more the brunt of it because, first of all because she was older and secondly because she takes things harder than our son does and | think she's convinced that my having been a Holocaust survivor, in spite of the fact that she didn't know about it for the first 10 years of her life, had a big effect on her because | was too protective, | worried too much about, you know, that she shouldn't catch cold, that she should eat the right things and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But then | point out there is plenty of American mothers who do the same thing, so | don't know whether she's right or not and | think it's futile to even spend too much energy discussing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">If that's what she wants to believe, that's okay, but Laura hey, there's nothing | can do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">My past is my past, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You're just going to have to accept it the way I'm accepting it. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">| think she has more difficulty accepting my past than | do. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">However, maybe with age, that will fade also, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="178">| think one of the things that bothers her the most is that she is fearful and she is scared, but if she had to be in my shoes, she would not have survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And no amount of my telling her, "Laura, nobody knows what they can do when they have to do it and nobody can, with certainty predict that if | do this, this or this, | will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">It's a lottery and you have to take it the way it comes." </span><span class="sentence" id="181">| don't think she quite buys it and she feels ill equipped to have survived the same things that | survived, which, you know, no matter what | tell her about it, that | don't know how | did it either and if you had to do it, you probably could do it too and nobody knows in advance. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">It doesn't matter how much | reinforce that, she has her ideas that she is not quite up to snuff to survive in something like that and finally my answer is, well | hope you never have to and that's it, you know, because there's nothing else | can do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So | think she has been affected by it in that, in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">| don't know what it's called, . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">| think maybe she should join a group of children of Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">In fact, | have mentioned it once, but | don't know whether she will or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Right now she's much too busy, she has two children, she just finished her Master's degree in counseling and she's going to do art therapy. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Right now she has, she works two and a half days a week with disturbed teenagers, where she does art therapy and she has two small children. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">| don't think she can take, take on anything more. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And she's, also she joined, even though she is married to a Quaker, a non-Jew, she joined the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">local temple</span> where they are members and she's very active in the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , so | think she has plenty to do right now and I'm not even suggesting any more that she should do anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">As a result, we have joined their <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> too, which is in <span class="REGION">northern Virginia</span> , because we felt that, since our son was out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> right now anyhow, we might just as well spend the holidays and go to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> where our daughter is. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">In fact, she's much more observant than | ever was. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Every Friday she lights candles with the children and she says the prayer over wine and bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">At least once a month they take the kids to what they call Tutshabat(ph), you know, services for the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">She goes to all the functions at the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and she has joined a group, | forgot what it's called, they are young people who are studying Judaism and how, what Jews now can do and expect of Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And she committed herself, she went to several seminars. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">You have to commit yourself, | think it's an arm of UJA who is doing that and it's, she feels very Jewish and she feels very proud to be a Jew, because there's so much intellectual accomplishments amongst the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Our son is non-practicing, however he surprised me greatly, he got married, when he got married, he married also a non-Jew, but the, a rabbi married them and she accepted to raise the children Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">In fact she committed herself voluntarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">But that's immaterial at this point because she's divorce, even though we still continue to see my former little daughter-in-law because | mean, she was part of the family, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So we still are in touch with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">He's not, but we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">He is now at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wharton</span> and he is very much career bound now, to make his way, what he's doing, but he surprised us, he called on Yom Kippur to say he was fasting. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So, you know, | guess he's not a practicing Jew, but he's a Jew and | think he knows he's a Jew and | think he will continue the tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So that pleases me. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Anything else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  What kind of role did Judaism play with them growing up and with you and your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  They went to, well when we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> they went to, my daughter went to <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> , my son was too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">She went to <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> , she's a very quick study and she's very bright, so she was learning Hebrew and she was learning all the songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And she still knows them. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Then, when we moved here, we joined a congregation, which was <span class="BUILDING">Bethesda Jewish Congregation</span> , which was a very strange congregation and not too successful for us, because the kids hated <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> so much, it was so poorly organized and so poorly done, that they absolutely refused to be bar mitzvahed. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And we decided not to force the issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Now my daughter is, has voluntarily come back to it and I'm hoping that my son will do the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">When he was getting married and he married a non-Jew, | said, "Just don't forget where | come from, that's all I'm asking of you." </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And he said, "Mom, | promise | won't." </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And | think that's good enough for me, so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">QUESTION:  What about you personally and how your ideas changed about Judaism, after?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  Yes, yeah, well | must say, | was a very reluctant Jew, if you go back in my history, the way the Jews grabbed me away from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , | was a very reluctant Jew, but | have slowly come back to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I've never denied it, but | never practiced it. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">| think I'm somewhat more Jewish oriented now, | realize that we are a small minority who has accomplished enormous things in spite of all the difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">| think the climate is changing also and that Jews are going to be more, treated with more respect, at least | hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">We are very much identified with Jewish causes in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and we do belong to a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , where we feel that, we don't, we go there because Laura wants to be more practicing and we go for the holidays and we take the children there, you know, for Sukote(ph) and and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So | think, plus the fact, oh there was something else happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">| went, a friend asked me to go to <span class="BUILDING">bible class</span> with them, given by a woman in her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , Naomi Rosenblatt, about whom you might have read about because she just came out with a book, Wrestling with Angels? </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Well | took some bible classes and | think that sort of also helped me along a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">It sort of portrays the Jews as a mixed lot, you know, it doesn't try to gloss over the imperfections and | decided that they are people, like everybody else and you have to sort of identify yourself with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So it has helped me to sort of get back into the fold also, the bible classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Okay, | just want to go back for a moment and talk a little bit more about some of the difficulties in making the transition to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  Well the first difficulty | had to grapple with was language, when | came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you know, how to learn the language quickly, because even when you speak a language, for instance, you don't think of stupid little things like, we would go out in a group together and they would say, tell jokes and | wouldn't understand the joke, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So you sort of feel out of it, you feel like the outsider and | must say that, even in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , which has greeted me with such warmth and accepted me, you know, people accepted me everywhere, | very often do feel like the outsider. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Like they reminisce, with a great deal of nostalgia about the good old days of certain songs, or the big bands and I'm looking like, you must be kidding, what are you talking about, you know, | can't even figure out what they are talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Oh, | remember when we were in, living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and a group of us, eight of us, went to see Judy Garland, was singing at one of the, the big, the big theaters and we went to see her and | thought she was awful, she was drunk, she couldn't sing and everybody was clapping and standing up and giving her. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">It's the nostalgia of the past which | am not sharing with anybody, even with people who are very close to me, like my husband, | am not sharing the nostalgia of the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">| know | am an outsider whenever they talk about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> days or songs or music or the <span class="BUILDING">musical theater</span> , I'm the outsider. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">But that's one thing | have to accept, | mean it's not so bad, actually, to have to accept that. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So that's one <span class="REGION">area</span> where | felt out of it, plus the fact | had to learn the language very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">There are other ways, you know, which, there are times when | feel, when | read about what's going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> for instance, | feel such, | have such a desperate feeling that, why are people doing that to other people? </span><span class="sentence" id="239">You know, | still am trying to understand the cruelty that men are capable of. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">It's, | think it's affecting me more than it's affecting other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">| have reached the point where | can't, | simply cannot, couldn't read about what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> , or about what was going on in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> and <span class="NPIP">places</span> like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I've, it, | took it too personally, you Know. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Probably much more personally than Americans by and large would take it because | lived through something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">It's still incomprehensible to me and | cannot understand that it's still going on, that people are still doing things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So that's an <span class="REGION">area</span> where it's giving me a great deal of difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">| sort of, | protect myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">| don't read about it, | don't want to know the details, I'm staying away from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">It's cowardly, but it, that's the only way | can work it. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">There are ways also that, you know, there are times when | have a lot of self doubts, you know, | haven't, I'm not always, I'm pretty well assured and | am very self reliant, but there are times when | feel I'm in situations where | feel | haven't been equipped right for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">For the longest time, although that's less and less, | had the most tremendous gaps in my learning and knowledge, you know, like history, | didn't learn about it, | didn't start until | was 11 years old to learn how to read and write, so consequently | have enormous gaps of knowledge in <span class="NPIP">places</span> which most people feel very confident and very comfortable in and I'm not, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So then | have to pedal back and say, "Oh, | have got to inform myself on this." </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So | am always playing catch up. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">No matter what I'm doing, I'm playing catch up, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But at this point I'm quite comfortable because | have noticed that other friends of mine, who have had a pretty normal life, playing catch up in many ways too. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So, but it took awhile for me to feel that I'm not the only one who has to play catch up. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">There is no such a person, who has an enormous amount of knowledge in every <span class="REGION">area</span> and they can feel confident in every <span class="REGION">area</span> , you Know. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Most people have <span class="DLF">gaps</span> in <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So that's another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">When I'm feeling disturbed, when I'm feeling upset or things like that, | can very well go through very disturbed nights where I'm dreaming and most of the time I'm dreaming that my life is in danger, which | don't think most people who have had a normal life, do dream about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">My life is in danger and I'm running for my life, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">It's a very uncomfortable feeling to have, but | have to deal with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">It's not uncommon for me to wake up in a sweat because somebody has been chasing me and has been shooting at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">| have to get over it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  Have you had, because | remember dreams played such an important role in your survival in a way, have you had even dreams about people from the past at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  All along my life, yeah, | do dream about people from the past, people in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> | have known, occasionally a person will surface who | think is either my father of my mother, but it's not very coherent and it's not very clear, but | do, yes, | definitely do dream about people in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  Another thing that strikes me is, and you sort of touched on it earlier about how difficult it was for you to, your husband had to convince you to actually buy a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  How do you look at even, <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and how was that transition, it seems that it would have been a difficult one. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Maybe you can talk about that a little bit more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  Yeah, I'm not very much attached to material objects, you know, it's, it's sort of, it's almost like they are on loan to me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">So | have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">It took mea long time to get, acquire a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , but it's only an object and it's on loan to me, somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">My <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> have always been like that, you know, they are on loan to me, they are not part of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">| know that many of my friends, their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> are so, or their possessions are so important to them, you know, it's a great comfort to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">To me it's not really that much of a comfort, possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Yes, diamonds, because | can pack them in and run. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So you know, a diamond is to me a prized possession because it's something | can take with me and it will feed me for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Not because it's a diamond, but because it's going to feed me for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Other things don't really count. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">My son always teased me, he cooks, he likes to cook, my son and he is the one who always had to go out with my husband and buy all the kitchen gadgets, because | never had the kitchen gadgets. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">| cooked, but | always make do with what | had, | never needed a million gadgets like most cooks | know need, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">They provided me with the gadgets. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Otherwise they knew | wasn't going to go out and buy the gadgets. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So, it's sort of that and also when we had children, you know it's funny to mention it because | don't know whether people think of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">| had a hard time having more than two children, because | only have two hands and if | needed to run, | was going to grab a child with each hand and run. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So for me, more than two children was out of the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">How could | have run with three children? </span><span class="sentence" id="288">That wasn't going to be feasible. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">So that's why we have two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">| happen to like children a lot, it's just that, that thing, that fixed idea that if | had to run, | only have two hands and two children | can manage, but more than that | can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So that's another, you know, there are little things like that which you don't think of. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">| used to drive my kids crazy if they had a rash, | was always there with the powder, you know, the Ammen's powder. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">| just drove them crazy with that, because to me having a rash was dangerous, because if you had a rash, you got yourself shot, because it meant you had, you had contact, contracted some disease and they weren't going to fool around, to have the whole <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> infected, so they were going to shoot you. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So to me arash is an ugly thing, life threatening, absolutely life threatening, so that's another. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">You know, you have those things that are very, come out in small ways, you know, very unexpected ways really, that they come out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  Do you have to sort of catch yourself doing this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  Yes, oh absolutely, yeah and in the end | made a joke of it, you know, that's the only thing you can do about it, make a joke of it really, so. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Also | think it has affected my friendships. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I'm only, | will not be friendly with somebody on whom | cannot have confidence and count on. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">| have to be able to rely on somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">If | have somebody who | notice is not reliable, they do not, they are not amongst my best friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">You know, they are acquaintances, but | will never make a good friend of somebody who is not a very reliable person. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Most of my friends are extremely reliable, so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION:  Tell me some other ways you think the Holocaust sort of played into your life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  I'm very self-reliant. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">| think for the longest time it drove Jim crazy that | would never take anybody's word for something, you know | would listen and then | would usually try to make up my own mind and it's very difficult for me to follow somebody else's advice unless | have really given it some thought and decided that it was very good advice, that it made sense and that | have internalized it. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I'm not a follower, | can't follow, because following would have meant death to me, | had to make up my own mind whether | was going to go on the right or the left, because the right might be death and the left might be life. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So it can be difficult for a soouse, you know, that you have to make up your own mind about everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">| think | have somewhat softened it, you know, because if person, if people have proven themselves to have very good judgment and to give me very good advice, I'm more likely to take that advice now. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But when | was younger, nope, | wouldn't take anybody's advice, | wouldn't take anybody's word for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">| had to really make sure for myself that where | stepped was safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And it can be unnerving for a person who has lead a normal life to come across somebody like that, it was very unnerving for my husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">QUESTION:  How did it affect your marriage, because you said that you didn't tell Jim initially about it, so if you were to act like that, | was wondering how he would figure out that that was where it was coming from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">ANSWER:  Well, he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">End of Tape 1 Tape 2
QUESTION:  Okay, let's start again with how the, your experience affected your marriage, your relationship with Jim.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  | don't know whether my experience, well it probably did in one way and that is, having been a survivor, | realized that surviving meant helping each other, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="317">You didn't survive unless you got help and consequently | probably was of much more help to him than an American wife would have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Jim had his problems getting adjusted to work and working for other people, he never could work well for other people and | was always a partner to him in that respect because first of all, | understood very quickly what was bothering him and | was able to, he was able to talk things over with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">He never made a move in his career without talking it over with me and without getting my help. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">| think that Holocaust survivors, at least my impression is, have an enormous amount of empathy for others and for their problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Maybe I'm generalizing too much, maybe I'm just speaking, | have an enormous amount of empathy for other people and their problems and certainly for a spouse's problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So, consequently | think | was more helpful to him than | think an American spouse would have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So in that respect, he got the benefit of my having been a Holocaust survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">The same time, he probably got some of the drawbacks, like | was much more cautious. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">But | wasn't cautious to the point where | could, | would call him back, because as a matter of fact when he went into business for himself, | remember sitting with friends and a friend saying, "How could you let him do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="326">| would never let Les go into business for himself, it's too threatening." </span><span class="sentence" id="327">| could do it, because | knew how important it was to him, you see and | knew that it was important for him to do work that was satisfying and where he was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">So | could, you know | could help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">In fact | help him very much when he went into business for himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">In other ways, | probably had more patience than most normal people, quote, normal people would have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  What about the self-reliant part you were talking about before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Well that annoyed him very often, that | wasn't more dependent on him, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Our generation, women were much more dependent on men and men liked that. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">| think Jim missed it to a certain extent, that | was so completely self- reliant and didn't depend on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">| had to learn to soften it a little bit, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">QUESTION:  When you say self-reliant and not dependent on him, do you mean emotionally, or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">ANSWER:  In many ways, different ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Emotionally, opening <span class="DLF">doors</span> for myself or doing things for myself, you know and emotionally too, you Know, not being, not being that reliant on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Feeling | have to make my own way, | have to, you know, | have to stand on my own two feet, | can't, in a way, probably without him knowing it, that was good for him, because it allowed, it liberated him to do his own thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">But | think there were times where he was annoyed because | was so independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And | softened it and he got used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">So | think what it sounds like is like a normal marriage, doesn't it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  | don't think there was anything abnormal about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">How long have you been married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  40 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">It will be 40 years this June. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">That's a long time, yeah, that's a very long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">| don't Know. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Well, another positive fallout from my past is that I'm very observant, because | had to learn, my life depended on it and that stood us in very good stead when we went into business together and in other ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">| could read people's reactions very quickly and many a time we would go into negotiations and | would be sitting there and men were wondering, "What is he doing with his little wife there?" </span><span class="sentence" id="354">You know and | would listen very carefully and then | would play back to him what happened and tell him that we had to do this or that because this is what | observed. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">| don't think he would have observed that and as a matter of fact, he said so, he never would have observed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">It was sort of uncomfortable, here | was, a whole <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> full of men and me, you know and sometime everybody was looking, | am supposed to get up and get coffee only I'm not getting up to get coffee you know, I'm sitting there listening. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">But after awhile it became normal for us to operate as a team like that and even the Japanese got used to it, they didn't know what to make of us when we got there, you know, who goes first, me or him? </span><span class="sentence" id="358">When we have to march into the <span class="BUILDING">president's office</span> , who goes first, Jim or me? </span><span class="sentence" id="359">They were completely confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">| think it brought more advantages than disadvantages. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I'm sure there were disadvantages, I'm sure that | was much less spontaneous than normally brought up people would be, but on the other hand, | brought all the advantages.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">QUESTION:  What would you observe when you were sitting there? </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Give us some examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  | would observe people and what, how they reacted, their facial expressions and how they reacted and | read people pretty well. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">My survival depended on it, to read people well. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">So | can, | can make a pretty shrewd guess, usually, about what they wanted out of a deal or what they weren't going to give up and, you know and be helpful in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">QUESTION:  Was your observations usually correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Yeah, he learned how to rely on them completely because they were usually pretty correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">My readings were pretty correct, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  It sounded like you have this, it's almost | guess a gift, in a way, of seeing things, or sort of perception that's very sharp.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  How else did that work into your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">ANSWER:  Maybe being more understanding, you know, understanding more when somebody was having difficulties delivering on times, you know and doing things like our employees, | was, rather than firing them, | was more apt to moving them around from <span class="NPIP">job</span> to <span class="NPIP">job</span> to see if we could find a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> for them, you know what | mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="375">| did a lot of that and that was usually on my advice, you know, let's not fire them, they're not working well, but let's try to see if we can fit them in somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">So that's another way it would work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">QUESTION:  What about your children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">ANSWER:  Well they claim that | was a very strict mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And at the beginning Laura would say, "That's because you're French," and | said, "You're right, that's fine." </span><span class="sentence" id="380">You know, it didn't matter, | would be very strict, she had to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by a certain time, she didn't like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">We had to eat our meals as a family, you know, they wanted to, to eat on the run and run out and we'd, why did we have to eat dinner together, you have to eat dinner together, because that's when we are sitting down and talking together. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So, and the other thing is that we never went off on too many vacations with our children, without our children, you know, friends of ours would go off and leave the kids, you know, either with a grandparent, we didn't have a grandparent to leave them with, or with a maid and | never did that, | never had a full time maid, you know, | only had help, but | didn't have a full time maid taking care of children, | was always there and consequently our children always came on vacation with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">We had to travel without them on business and that | had to and | had no choice, but if it was for pleasure or vacation, they always came with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">As a matter of fact Eric and Laura came to Europe when he was seven years old and she was 11, because | went to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And we made many trips together, to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">By the time they were teenagers, they had already traveled and they were always traveling with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">As a consequence, our kids spent a lot of time with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">| think that's probably why. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">| know that my friend complain they don't want to go with them anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Our kids are the ones who suggested, we have made it now a family tradition that for Memorial Day we all go away together, with all the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">We used to all go away at Christmas time, between Christmas and New Year when Eric was still in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and Laura was already married, until Laura had a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">We always went away for a week to <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> , together. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">We spent a lot of time with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Birthdays are always a big celebration, you know, it's like a three, it's like a Polish wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">From the time they were very little, they had a party where they invited all their friends and they played games, they had one day when they wanted to go to the favorite <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> for dinner, just the family and one day where | had to make their favorite dish at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So it's was always three celebrations for each birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Our daughter complained that when she went off to and! </span><span class="sentence" id="398">was ____ too, when she went off to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , nobody made a big deal about the birthday and she felt very let down, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">So I, so they were, | was sitting there, getting reproaches that we made too much of a big deal about birthdays and so when they went off to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , suddenly the rest of the world didn't sit up and take notice of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">| said, "Well, you will forgive me, | hope, you know, that | made a big deal about it." </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Jim didn't have a very happy childhood, he can't ever remember a birthday party, his parents haven't given him, so consequently his birthday is always celebrated with a great deal of fanfare. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">So we have those big celebrations, the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">We are a small family, but we always have lots of celebrations. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">So that's a way of, of . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Another way that | can notice now with my grandchildren is, and that's not too good, it's almost like | see in my little granddaughter, me as a child and | am so protective of her that | am driving her mother crazy at times. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So | had to take a step back and say, "Cool it." </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="408">| am very protective of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">| will notice much faster than her mother when she is not well. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">You know, when she has a cold brewing or something and | will say, "Laura, | think she's coming down with something." </span><span class="sentence" id="411">You know, because | am so, I'm like a hawk over her. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">It's not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">So | am sort of trying to step back and not, my daughter's much more laid back. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">She had a cold, she has a cold, she will go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anyhow, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">| would never do that, but | have to step back and say well, that's her way of running things, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Well, | told everybody | was from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> because it would have been too complicated an explanation and telling my life story to everybody who asked me where | was from. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">It was easiest to say | came from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> because | spent quite a few years there and | went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, so consequently, and | liked <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , | really liked it, so it was very easy for me to say, | grew up in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , but | was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and that's usually what | tell people and it's pretty accurate. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">You know, because | don't have, | cannot tell them all the detours | made, it's just too many and it would tell that, you know, when you start with one ... so how come you were there and how come you were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">It would be very difficult for me to explain that without telling my story to everybody and | don't like to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">| wanted to make a point, what was the point about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">QUESTION:  Considering that you're not from anywhere, you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">ANSWER:  | don't, | feel like I'm a visitor everywhere, I'm not American, however | have lived in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> longer than in any other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I've lived in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for 40 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I'm not a typical American, but I'm not a typical anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">| consider myself a little bit like a visitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Maybe a permanent visitor, but I'm a visitor none the less because | didn't grow up here and | don't have all the costumes of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">| felt the same way in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , even more so because | was still learning French, | wasn't an adult and | was much more self-conscious about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Here, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , there are so many more foreigners and so many more strangers, | mean the whole <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> is sort of an amalgamation of strangers, | feel more comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , if | lived in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> now, | probably would find my own level in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , | probably would find people with a variety of backgrounds and | would fit myself in there too, but | don't feel like <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> is my home country, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> definitely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Any of the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> | went through, like <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , not at all, you know, they are foreign countries to me and | think the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> is where I'm feeling the most comfortable, really.</span></p>
