QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1664">ANSWER:  — originally with Georgine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">So Georgine came to visit me, how she got there, I don’t know, most likely by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , because we didn’t have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">Have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was aMay 4, 2013 luxury in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">So she must have come by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to visit me, and naturally there was a question of money, because when you are in the military, you don’t make — what do you make? </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">So there were some difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">Do I remember what difficulties? </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">Somehow we made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">You know, maybe some money was left over from the father — her father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">But you know, the — during that kind of a situation that’s happening here to someb — not want to touch that that base, but when people — my father-in-law, when — when they heard that this one was transported to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and this one — so, as a precaution, they gave — they had a housekeeper of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was living in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">So they gave her some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">How much? </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">No idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">He had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">Remember, the time goes back now, 60 — 70 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">So plastic was a novelty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">So, in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , when you had — when you bought a drink, let’s say like a Coke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">Was not a Coke, like a Coke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">So it has a top that you closed, you know, but it was the old-fashioned thing, which was very difficult and maybe not nice looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">So he did a lot, with a partner, plastic — you know —
QUESTION:  Screw top.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1685">ANSWER:  — th-the tops which we today take for granted, you know, and [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span><span class="sentence" id="1686">May 4, 2013
ANSWER:  So it was a novelty, and he was doing extremely well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">So he gave his housekeeper X — no idea how much — dollar, but you keep it, and then they come back — you know, you give it back to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">Well, there are lots of people who didn’t come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1689">In that connection, I would like to refer to a story which appeared in “The Wall Street Journal’ not more than maybe two weeks ago, and I gave it to Elise to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1691">Because it turned out that <span class="REGION">New York state</span> , there are unclaimed insurance policies, monies which were left around in <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1692">In the bill — b — in the billions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">And the story was that <span class="REGION">New York state</span> can get this if it stays unclaimed, because there is a law, if you don’t claim X after so many years, it becomes the property of the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">So naturally, <span class="REGION">New York state</span> , I can imagine if they could get a couple of million, perhaps billion, oh my gosh, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1695">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1696">ANSWER:  So that was the story, and I have no doubt, insurance companies, <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> , and I’m telling to you out of experience, Georgine knew that her father had the life insurance policy with X — I forgot the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">So when we came here, we tried to get in touch with those people, we found some document showing that he had this, and he had that, and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">So the answer which we got, if I would look for it, I would find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">I’m not going to take the time now —
QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah.</span><span class="sentence" id="1700">May 4, 2013
ANSWER:  — and I will not take the time then either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1701">But they responded that we have to produce a death certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1702">Now, to get a death certificate for somebody who passed away in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , is like — I don’t have to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1703">So nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">But that means that that policy was never consummated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1705">So, if he was entitled to those benefits, 10,000 - 100,000, whatever, that was never paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1706">So really, the unclaimed amounts which are there, must be in the — well, I’m telling you, the story was — they mentioned ski — I think, two billion dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">Because I’m sure my father-in-law wasn’t the only person who did this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1708">QUESTION:  But you’re talking — when you’re talking about where they were unclaimed, it was in the — <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> where it was unclaimed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1709">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1710">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1712">ANSWER:  Yeah, but there’s — if the money would have been somehow, say inherited by Georgine, or — or somehow —
QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1714">ANSWER:  — it would have come —
