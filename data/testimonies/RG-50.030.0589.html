<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  Well, they — we — we just kept — kept fighting them, that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And they — they finally gave in, the enemy did. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But wha — I always remember one German lady, she come out on the — on her <span class="DLF">porch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We just chased the — the German soldiers out of this here one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And when we were going into it, and we stopped for a — a — like a rest, why this lady come out and she says, I want 12 of you men to come in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Well, we didn’t have any idea why she want 12 us men in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So 12 of us [indecipherable], we went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And she sits us around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , she goes over to her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">In them days the Germans had put in all <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal stoves</span> in their <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And she opened up the — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> , and there’s 12 apples in there she baked, just for us guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And she — she gave each one of us an apple. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And I’ll always forget — I always remember that woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I — how I wished I would have got her name and address, because she was so good to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Then she took me around, I don’t know why she picked on me, but she took me around her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , showed me all around in there, her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And she had three sons that was in the army, German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">October 8, 2010 But they were all prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We had one, and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> had one, and the Russians had one. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I said to her, well, I said, Pll tell you, I says, you’re pretty sure of getting those two — two of them back out of those three, alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And I says, now the one we have and the one the — the — at — let’s see what a — well, we’ll say <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and the one they have, the British, th-the — I said, the one the British have and the one we have you’re pretty sure of getting those two back. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">But, I says, the one that the Russians have, I says, I can’t tell you about them, I said, those guys are nuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I said, all they want to do is kill everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And so that’s exactly what they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">QUESTION:  Were the Germans good soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  You bet they were good soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And when they were shooting those guns, they were dead shots, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Now I had one shooting at me with a machine gun, cause we ran a — he-here’s the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I don’t know whether you know any — you know how ya — how the army when they’re — when you’re tra — going into a battle like, well, we’re go — we’re going along, coming up — up through this <span class="DLF">field</span> that, and someone says that — that the Germans are up ahead somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Well, we always had scouts out, two scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They’d be about oh, say, 200 yards ahead of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Now, they were not supposed to shoot any bra — any Germans that they seen, but they were supposed to give us the silent signal. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">The silent signal was a — y-you laid your rifle down, you grabbed ahold of it and — by the barrel and by the — and by the back October 8, 2010 of it, and you put it above your head and go like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">That 1s your signal that the enemy was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">QUESTION:  An up and down movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">ANSWER:  Yes, they — and they — and they didn’t make a sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Well, anyhow, then wh- when we got that message, by boy they just — they blew a whistle and we just spread out and start digging in right away, because we knew we were running into a <span class="DLF">trap</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And so the Germans, they smartened up. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">They thought by us cat — by us having those two scouts there, they were told tr — told, do not shoot the scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Th- The German did. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">He says, wait til they get through your <span class="DLF">lines</span> , but make sure they don’t see you to give out and give the — us the — the warning. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Says go, and — wait a minute now, I think of something about that — anyhow, he says, let them go through your ra-ranks, but make sure they don’t see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And then, when they get through it, grab them, and then we’ll put them in — in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , then, for the — you know, the — the — the ten — well, anyhow, the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And so anyway, that’s what they did, cause we lost both of our scouts at first, but we got them back after a bit, cause one of our shells went and blew the <span class="DLF">fence</span> down, and wa — th-then they shot out of it, and they got back with us again. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And they said that when they were — the Germans ran, he says, we ran right with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">He says, those shells and that you guys were shooting at us, well, they didn't give a hoot who they killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">So anyhow they — the scouts, we ha — we had them scouts, but whenever they give that signal, we would — we would October 8, 2010 — see, we'd be going in the single file, maybe might be three or four in a row, you know how they are when you’re marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And as soon we got that signal boy, you s — just spread right out. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And everybody got their — we had little shovels. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">You probably sm — maybe you seen them already. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And we’d dig a <span class="DLF">foxhole</span> and get down in under below the ground surface. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And then that — then the — we were ready for fight then. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">But if you — if we didn’t see that signal, why we would walk right into this trap. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Now, we ran into one of them <span class="DLF">traps</span> , and all of a sudden they start shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And I hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> right where I was, you — whenever — when they start shooting, nobody has to tell you to get down and stay down, you learn that quick, because you want to live a little longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So anyhow, we went and — wait a minute now. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">We — well, we — we got up there an-and then the Germans start shooting at us, and we got down and then we start shooting back. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Well, I was out, right out in the open <span class="INT_SPACE">spaces</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Well, my buddy was, when he was shooting his rifle, I was reloading mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And when I was shooting mine, he was reloading his. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So we had a steady sho — stream of bullets going up where the machine gunners were. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So anyhow, they went out and he — he turns on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I was laying down on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> shooting there, and I didn’t have no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> or nothing to get behind, I was out in the open. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And my buddy, he — he got the only <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> that was there, he — he dove behind it. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Anyway, and the Germans saw me. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">So he turns the machine gun on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Now, he [indecipherable] like, well, we’ll just — there, there. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">We'll just say here October 8, 2010 [indecipherable] right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I stretched out this way, see, and up — the Germans are up that way, and he starts shooting at me, and he come about that far away from my body. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">He dug a <span class="DLF">hole</span> , a <span class="DLF">trench</span> with that machine gun, from my head down to my feet, about four inches deep with those bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">That’s — an-and I was laying right there, all that dirt was flying in my face and all over my body and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And I was trying to crawl inside of my helmet, but I wasn’t do — doing good. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">My head was already in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So I got to thinking, if I laid still, he’d think he killed me, and he’Il go and shoot somebo — at somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So whenever he stopped — he had to stop and reload, you know, and when he’d run out of shells, why he’d take a couple of minutes for him to get the new belts 1-in there of shells. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Well, while he was doing that, I was lay — laying there figuring out what I was going to do to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Anyhow, I had dirt and mud and everything in my face, and all over my body and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">The whole way down my body, I was just covered with dirt an-and m-mud, you might say. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">So anyway, I — I got a — while — while he was shooting, h-he to — he change his — his targets then. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">He looked for somebody that was — he could see, cause he saw me laying there and he figured he’d killed me, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Well, that worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Anyhow, he starts shooting at somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Now, when he starts shooting at somebody else, I was the only one in the outfit that had rifle grenades. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">The captain come out to me when we — fe — before we started out that day and he says, Shultheis. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I said, yes sir? </span><span class="sentence" id="261">He says, you’re my grenadier. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I said, yes, sir, I said, sir. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">October 8, 2010 He says, yeah, what do you want? </span><span class="sentence" id="264">He said — I said, what’s a grenadier? </span><span class="sentence" id="265">He ha — he said, you’re the guy to stop the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So I pulled one — I pulled out the gre-grenade, he gave me a ba— a pa — a bag like, see, I would call it a bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Anyhow, it fit over your shoulder and it had six grenades in it; three of them phosphorous and three expl — high e-explosion. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So I said to him, what am I supposed to do with these? </span><span class="sentence" id="269">He says, you’re supposed to stop the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I picked it out and I said, sir, I said, you think that this little thing here 1s going to stop one of them great big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="271">He says, I know it will. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I says, what do I shoot at, whenever I shoot at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And he says, the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Now, I never knew this before that — before that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">He says I — when the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> are gone, there’s a — a little track in the center of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> , and it — and it runs — it keeps those su — tracks on the wheels like, even, so that they don’t come off. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And he says, all you gotta do is hit that wheel, it’s about that big, he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">But that’s like telling you to go jump in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Anyhow, I said yes, sir, I says, I think we can stop them all right then, 1f we can — if I can hit that — if I can just hit that there part where you just told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And so anyhow, he s — he — he agreed with me on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So he went and let me figure it out myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">So — but I— I never saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">S — but I did use them on — on machine guns, and boy it worked good. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So anyway, this one whose — this machine gunner that was shooting at me, I th — I thought, if I stop jiggling around here, that th — that he’II think he killed me, because he was pretty far away, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So, by gollies, it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I laid still and October 8, 2010 he sh — quit shooting at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I guess he must have stop — must have ran out of shells and he had to put another belt on, and while he was putting that belt on, I— I-—I rigged up my — my grenade launcher on my rifle, and you shoot those grenades with a blank. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So they told me, they says, for God’s sakes, make sure you don’t have a live round in your rifle when you shoot that, because he says, if you shoot that with a live round, you’re gonna blow your own head off, whenever you would shoot that — that grenade, he says, instead of it going that way, it would stay right where it was and knock your head off. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So th-that — that’s a good — good lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">So — so I never did, I always checked it all — all the time, make sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So anyway, I said to my buddy, I says, I’m gonna fix those babies now. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And he says yeah, you know, what are you gonna do? </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I says, I’m gonna send them a phosphorous grenade. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So I put a phosphorous grenade on cause they are — they were the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">The high explosions, they were bad, but th — but the — the others, they were worse, they — oh, man, they were miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">They — cause when they — when this phosphorous grenades went off, they didn’t quit burning when — if it hits you. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Say like if a — if it hits you in — in your arm, that would burn the whole way through your arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">It’Il melt your — even melt your bones, they said. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And that’s how hot it went. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Anyway, I said to my buddy, I says, okay, I says, I’m ready to shoot, I says. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">You watch up over the top of them <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , see if you can see it going. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And I stuck the huge — you always stick the — the stock of your rifle in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and raise the barrel up. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And I was laying there October 8, 2010 beside it there, and I raised her up, and I said, you wa — I says, are you watching? </span><span class="sentence" id="303">He said yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I said, well, here it goes. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I reached down and I pulled the trigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Well, that grenade, you could see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I-It goes pretty fast, but you can still see it going. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">It went — oh, it made a beautiful bow right up over the top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and come down. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And on the way down, it must have hit a — a limb, because I don’t think it went off at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , because it seemed like it — when the — when it disappeared and you couldn’t see it, why, it was — wasn’t enough time for it to hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> when it exploded. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But when it exploded, it made a great, big puff of smoke, and flames, and — and — and it — and the phosphorous was everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And I heard them guys screaming up there where they — where I was shooting at, so I — I —I’m pretty sure I hit them, because that was them screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Now, I never seen any of them, or anything like that, because they were pretty well camouflaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Anyway, we — we — that stopped that whole [indecipherable] that whole battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">The Germans jumped up after I shot that, and they ran ba-backwards, back over — to get away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Our outfit, they — they got up, they ran back the other way, I ne — I never figured out yet why they went that way, cause it was a gort in the wrong direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">So anyway, we didn’t see no more Germans that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And the me — and my buddy, he s — he’s young. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Come on Shultheis, come on Shultheis, everybody’s leaving us. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I said, I’m not leaving til I get my rifle reloaded. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And I ha — I had to take all my stuff off my rifle, and that — you know, the launcher and everything, and — to October 8, 2010 get to my rifle to work right with the bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And then I put a— ac-—aclip with nine rounds in it, then I was ready to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Then I stood up, and when I stood up there wasn’t a soul around, just him and I. Our men got up, they went the one way and the Germans went the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And that’s another thing I never understood, why we went backwards instead of going forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Anyway, we — we didn’t have no more problems with them that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And then — then my buddy and I, we went back to where the — kind of back to where the machine gunners were and they had to stay up all night on guard, so we — we each dug a <span class="DLF">slit trench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Now, a <span class="DLF">slit trench</span> , I don’t know whether you know what a <span class="DLF">slit trench</span> is or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Oh, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Okay, that’s just where you can lay down in it, it’s big enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">We di — we dug that, each one of us dug a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , you might say. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Filled full of leaves and then crawled down in under them leaves and go to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And the — we let the — we let the machine gunners stay awake that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So —

<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  Well, we — what we could see, wa — you couldn’t see too much at first, because it was like boarded off like, you know, say like the dead, and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Now, they had a big pile of dead laying in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">We saw tha — I saw that. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">But we no more than got into the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , I’d say oh, I don’t know how far in we got, not very far. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">But when you come through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , then you saw the <span class="DLF">furnaces</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And then — an-and — and the — the dead was piled up a pile, right out there in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , just laying on top of each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And what they were doing, they were taking them and they was putting them in the fire and burning them. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">But I guess it made a terrible smell, October 8, 2010 because they said that the — the German population was complaining, because it stunk so bad, you know, from the — the bodies being cooked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  How long were you inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Can you describe how you came across that key?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="437">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I was — I was going int — into the — into the n — n — around the <span class="DLF">fence</span> way, you know, in — into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , we’ll call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And here I happened to look down and I saw this key laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And th-the people coming out of — out, was running right across it. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And — and the G.I.s that was going into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> walked over top of it too. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Now, I was in a couple times in fra — like — well, let’s see, where they — where they had the — had the <span class="DLF">shoe mines</span> and stuff, they had [indecipherable] <span class="DLF">mine</span> — [coughs] Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And the Germans were great for that there — having <span class="DLF">mine fields</span> for us to walk onto. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Only once that I got real, real close to losing a foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">But the lieutenant saved my hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">He — he was right behind me and here he happened to October 8, 2010 look down and he saw I was gonna just step on one. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And all he did [indecipherable] he says, Shultheis, he says, stop immediately, he said [indecipherable] he said, stop, he says, a <span class="DLF">mine</span> on — a <span class="DLF">mine</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And a — and I was coming down with my foot and I froze right there, I never went another inch. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And I looked down and there was a <span class="DLF">mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">If it wasn’t for him, I would have a wooden leg now. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">He saved my li — my hide there. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And the first — first one — time, why we were going, we had our — we started at three o’clock in the morning, it was pitch dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">We got out of our <span class="DLF">foxholes</span> and the captain says, now, you’re — you’re to bring back — we’re gonna — to bring back some Germans alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And he — and he says, for God’s sakes, and a few other words that you’re not supposed to say, and he says, don’t shoot them all, he says, we want to — we want to question them. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">He says, we're gonna — we’re gonna g-go — we’re gonna go after them about right, and he says, we want to know what we’re gonna run into. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">So, anyhow, I — tha-that’s — that’s how that one went. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Anyway, we — we went across the <span class="DLF">field</span> then, and — and the — the one scout stepped on a <span class="DLF">mine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Now, he was about, I’d say two — maybe a hundred yards ahead of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Well, we didn’t know what happened, we just heard the explosion, so we stopped, and the lieutenant s-scattered us guys around — around this <span class="NPIP">place</span> where — where that noise come from, and you hear — what it was was one of the — the scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Anyhow, I said to him, I said, sir, I said, I’ll go in there and [Il get that guy, and Ill bring him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">He said okay, but he says, wait a minute til we October 8, 2010 get you a medic, he says, you’re gonna need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I said, all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So he told his sergeant what to tell his men. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">The sergeant went over, he told the first guy, sa — medics wanted up front. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And they passed it down the <span class="DLF">line</span> , like the guy behind him and you know, like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And then I took a few minutes and — and the medic come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So the medic come out when I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I said, th — one of the scouts has some — he went haywire in here, I says. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">We don’t know exactly what it is yet, and the lieutenant told me to wait til you got up here because I’m going in after him and bring him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And he says, okay, he says, let’s go. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So I says, all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So we went in and there — and I found him right away, he was laying by a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bush</span> , and he had one leg — one foot off. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">That’s what those <span class="DLF">shoe mine</span> were for. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">The Germans discovered it take at least four guys to get a— a wounded guy back to the rear, and that’s four li — guys less shooting at hi — at his men. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So, anyhow, we got the — th-the medic bandaged his — his stump up, and we got him up on his one good foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And I had the — I had his arm around th — my neck and — and the medic had th — had a 0 — the other around and the — and we just ready to start out and he says, I could carry him better if I was on your side, he says, do you want to trade? </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I says sure, I says, I can carry him no matter which <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So — so anyhow, we chi — we swi — switched. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I took his arm off my neck, I went over and got his other arm, put it around my neck, the medic come on around. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">He puts his — put the other arm — his other arm around his neck, and na — and I says, are you ready to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And he says yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So the medic October 8, 2010 says, all right, let’s go. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Well, he took one step and he blew his foot off. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Right where I was standing, I don’t know how I missed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I never even seen th — a <span class="DLF">mine</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And he’s the only guy of all of them that I saw wounded that cried up — up front, on the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And here, when he went in — when they sent him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after they got his artificial foot and that, why, he drank himself to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And he — and his mother says that he couldn’t stand being crippled.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  Well, we — we never had no — n-no trouble like that, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Most of it was, they were in like <span class="DLF">fields</span> and stuff like that, and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And there weren’t too much <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> fighting, we didn’t do much of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  What wa — wha-what is your most vivid memory of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  Well, I guess it was that — I guess it was just the part — well, I — I'll tell you the — the — my most memory of that is, is whenever they were shooting at us, and — and if you didn’t shoot back, why you’d — you’d wind up in the <span class="DLF">graveyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And I had an M-1 rifle they gave me, that was a wonderful gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Boy oh boy, when you put a October 8, 2010 sight on that, why he was a goner. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Now I had chances of shooting more than what I did, but I captured them mostly, and I turned them over to the officer in charge.</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="558">Well, there was no fire in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , it was out, so I s — told him about it and I says, I got a hand grenade here and I got the pin pulled out and I — and you’re in my route, get the heck out of that <span class="DLF">doorway</span> , because I said, I got nine seconds to g — from the time I let go of that grenade, before it goes off. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And I want to be out of here and get into one of those <span class="DLF">trenches</span> out there before it explodes. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And so here, in our talking, one — one of them Germans woke up. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">He’s sitting up there in the top f — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">top bunk</span> , his legs hanging down, he’s rubbing his eyes, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And I walk over to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And he never seen me and he had his — both hands up there, rubbing his eyes there, getting the cobwebs out of them, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And when he opened — took his hands down, he’s looking right down the barrel of my rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I says, all right, I says, the war’s over for you guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I said, get the ba — get them out of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">He said one word, brrp, they all just jumped right out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> so quick and they all landed in the middle of the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">There they are, all standing there with their long- johns on and a pair of socks, that’s all they had on. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I says, as of right now, you are all prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And here, in the meantime, my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> th — they were getting ready to take off, they — I heard the motors starting up out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">They w — they’d sit there for awhile to you know, get them warmed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And I said to them, shake it up, and get your clothes on fast, I said, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> are getting ready to pull out and I don’t October 8, 2010 feel like walking any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So, I said, ’'m going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and you come out when you get dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">But, I said, don’t hesitate, shake it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So they got — th-th-they — they were — they oper — they c-cooperated pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">They come out and as each one would come out I would, you know, shake them down and see if I could feel any pistols or knives on them and that and none of them had any on. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And I — and I showed them the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> that I was on. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I says, now, I says, that’s — that’s the — the one I want to go on, that’s the one I belong to. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Either head for that th — tha — for — for that there Lanair(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And they said okay, so I said, all right, four [indecipherable] dudes, they got into a <span class="NPIP">part</span> , and so I had the six of them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And the one says, there are three loaves of homemade bread in there, can I go get them?

darn if I didn’t get seasick on the dumb thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And I crossed that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> four times. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">An

id="666"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Well, I said, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> , I said, it’s just as far as — I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Johnstown</span> at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">An-And he told me, you know, that he stopped at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Johnstown</span> and the next stop was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And I said, I don’t want to get off at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Well, he says, that’s tough luck, he says, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> doesn’t co — stop anywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">So what I did, I — I hitchhiked <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And here I — first there was a — a young couple, they brought their bro — the girl’s brother, I think it was, back. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">He was going back into the service again, he was out on furlough. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And this was in <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> about the same distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So anyhow, instead of going — coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I hitchhiked a ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And this young couple that brought her brother back to — to leave on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Johnstown</span> , why they picked me up and they took me so far, and then I was stuck, I was out on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> there, and there was — there was snow, and the blowing, and I was about freezing to death, and anyhow, I-I was standing there thumbing, you know, and here comes a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer truck</span> with a bighearted October 8, 2010 guy behind the wheel. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">He stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">He said, how

</span><span class="sentence" id="687">So I jumped in there and — and — and we stopped at one <span class="NPIP">place</span> there and he got coffee and that — and I called my wife up, it was after — after midnight then. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I said, I’m getting closer [indecipherable] I said, I’m co — I’m a-coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So then yeah, I says, he’s gonna let me off here at — you know when you get to — on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> out there where it comes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Latrobe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And I says, y — he said he’d let me off there. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And I said, we’ll be there in a little while, I says, he stopped to get a cup of coffee, and I says, then — and then we’ll be on our way. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Well, he di — he lets me off at — right at the <span class="DLF">crossroads</span> there, and when he pulled out, here comes a — the old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Ford</span> out with my wife in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">My wife and two of her aunts and her brother, and he was driving the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">I’ll always remember him, he says, you sure you got the right guy? </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So anyhow, that was our — my trip <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Then I went down to my — my dad’s <span class="NPIP">place</span> to see my mother and dad, and that was al-almost three o’clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And then Mom says to me, she says, [indecipherable] here, you take my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , you and Jenny take my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I'll go sleep with Dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So that’s what — that’s the way we did then, for that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Boy, it — it was wonderful being <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I’Il tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">She come a- running — she come running out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and she met me the halfway on — on the — on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">We were standing out there necking and it’s a wonder we didn’t get run over. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">But it was — 1t was something though, to see her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I said, see, I told October

class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> , and then — and again I was up riding on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">We did a lot of tank riding. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And here he comes down the <span class="DLF">line</span> , and at first — we were — first saw him, why the one guy says, ah look, here come one of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fighter planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Well just about the time we looked, he opened up both guns on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , you know, he had one on each wing. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And — well, there is only one wing, it was only one wing on them, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Anyhow, on the side of propeller was a machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Now, when we saw the bu — the tracers coming out of that — out of those wings, we knew that he was not our friend at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So anyway, I went and I put a—a-—a rifle grenade on my rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I hurry up and got that on and got it all ready for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I was ga — because heck, he was only about as high as the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And so he’s coming down, he was shoo — he — he did some damage and he killed a few guys, but — but he missed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Anyhow, the guys all jumped off that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> but me. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I stayed on and I — me and the — and the machine gunner. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I wanted to see that machine gunner bring that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> down. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Heck, he was only that high, I was — couldn’t see how he could possibly miss it. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">So, we could see his bullets going — going down, you know, and when they were — when he was shooting at — at all the rest, you know, as he’s coming down the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">So anyhow, I — let’s see now. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Oh, I’m already with the grenade, that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">So I got it ready for him and I had the safety off of my rifle, and I had it to my shoulder, and I October 8, 2010 had that — had the play up — taken up on the — on the trigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">All I had to do is just put a little bit of pressure on it and it would have went off. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">So, when I s — looked at him, and I says, heck sakes, this here — this grenade is supposed to cover a 50 foot diameter, you know, like a circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And I said, if I hit him, I’m going to blow my own head off. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I said, that’s not going to be any good. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">So I didn’t shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">But I was going down there and — down there because a-another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> come right behind him, and the guys start shooting at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And here he — he pulled his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> up so you could see the bottom of his wings, where he had our insignia on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And th-the American insignia was a flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And so then they, course, they stopped shooting at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">So then I watched him and when he come down a piece, went a piece, why I — I don’t know how that German knew that guy but — that guy was behind him — but anyway, he climbed for altitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Now he went up, I would say, approximately a thousand feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Now ma — I’m not — might be a way off, but anyhow, when he made a circle, well the — the other di— guy who made a circle, the German, so did our man right behind him, when he circled. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And he ga-gave two bursts out o-of his — his — his — our man did, at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Well, he hit him both times, and when he hit him, I was watching him and the — the — when he shot first, why all of a sudden — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> was going like this — all of a sudden the nose dropped down, and — and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> was going down, it was heading towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">So th — our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> didn’t shoot no more after. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">But the farther down he come, the more smoke October 8, 2010 come out of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And then finally it hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and it exploded. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Well, I watched that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> the whole way down and when it exploded, but it — th-the — the driver, he-he never made it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And he was only a young fella too, because when he come down and passed there at one time, I saw him sitting in there with both thumbs on the — on the triggers, when he was shooting at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And I thought, if I stand still, he’Il miss me. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Well, I had the bullets coming both sides of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Well, the one — the one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , he got pretty close at getting me on that one, because I was leaning against the — the duffle bags of the — of the g-g — G.I.s in the — in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">They had them strapped to the [indecipherable] o-on the — on the outside of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And two bullets went though that — that there <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> I wa — or that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleeping bag</span> that I was leaning on. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">But I didn’t know that until after he was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">So he missed me again.</span></p>
