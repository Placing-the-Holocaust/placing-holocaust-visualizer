<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  We had a very happy childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My father was a very productive merchant. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We had a wonderful family life. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My family was very active in our congregation, and our congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> encompassed and really was the — the last of the giant <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> that were built in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">When I say giant <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> , I’m talking about a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that housed in excess of a thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">But it was the very last one that ga — its inauguration came about in 1930, the year that I was born, and it died, or was extinguished in 1938, on Kristallnacht.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  What denomination was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Was it Orthodox? </span><span class="sentence" id="32">October 15, 2010
ANSWER:  It was a lit — what we call in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was called Liberal. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">It had a choir, it had an organ, it had those things that Orthodoxy would not have smiled on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  You mentioned that your father was a merchant. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">What was his line of business exactly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  My father had a — along with his brothers owned a wholesale — wholesale merchant of women’s hosiery. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I think that was really the main part of their business, and some other accessories 1n addition thereto. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But mainly — mainly their business consisted of wholesale hosiery. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Remember everything at — during those — those years was constituted by Mom and Pop businesses, and my father was a very successful merchant. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And also, very sharing, very sharing a-as far as his willingness to share his good fortune with the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">My father also was a front line soldier in World War I. And he was active — he was — he was in the — he was very active in the congregation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  So, I’m — I’m guessing that that means that your family didn’t only go to high holiday services, they would — they would have practiced every week, or how — how did that work at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  I—I would — I would generally go t — with my father almost every Friday night to services. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Maybe some once in a while on Saturday, but Friday night was a—a norm for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">October 15, 2010
QUESTION:  What — what did your mother do during the day? </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Did she have a job, or did she stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  My father — my — my mother was a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> — a home-keeper, if that’s the proper terminology. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We had a — we had a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and my mother kept things flowing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  You mentioned that your father was a successful businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Would you describe your family as middle class, upper-middle class —

<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Can you describe the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> or <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that you used to own?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Well, if I took you there I could tell you — show you exactly where it 1s, as I have taken members of my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Unfortunately it’s not standing any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I can visualize the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in my head exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">My — my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was towards the end — the rear of the — of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I had a <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , and — where I raised vegetables, tomatoes, occasionally flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">We had a lovely <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> , beautiful <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Was this in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , the vegetables and flowers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  No, this — this was in a — on a — on the window box in — on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  Do you recall how many <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> were in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  Substantial number of <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , that’s all I can tell you, I’ve no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">October 15, 2010
QUESTION:  Did your family have any housekeepers or —
ANSWER:  Yeah, we had a— we had a — we had a housekeeper.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Okay, any nannies, or —
ANSWER:  Yes, [had a nanny. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And a matter of fact, at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I think we have a picture of myself dressed up as little boys were during that time period, with my nanny.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Do you recall whether your nanny was Jewish or Gentile?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Definitely not Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Do you remember going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Yes, when my — my parents enrolled me in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , it was decided that’s where I would go, and I lasted in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for about maybe a day, maybe two days, three days, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Very, very quickly, I was beaten during that time period and — because the other boys asked me what I was, who I was, and th-the minute I said Jew, I was put to the test immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And my mother was called to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , she was told by the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that it would be best for my — my protection to be taken out of that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So I— my experience of <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> may have been extinguished then after one day, or — or two days at the most.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Do you recall what year this was, was this first grade —
ANSWER:  Well, would have been — it would have been 19 — roughly about 1936, I would imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">October 15, 2010
QUESTION:  Because you just mentioned that they had asked you who they were and you replied you were a Jew, I know this might be hard to answer, but did you have a sense that this was something you could talk about? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Did your parents warn you not to say that you were a Jew, or conversely did they say that that’s fine?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  I think my parents tried to protect me by not saying much of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And I was never told what to say or what not to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">But I think I, from that experience, I learned rather quickly as to what I was, who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And I think my parents shielded me from all the discriminatory acts that had been ongoing in the mid-1930s. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">For example, I had an uncle of mine, a brother of my — of my — my mother, who was a very successful attorney in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And of course he was — you know, I found out later on why he wasn’t working any more, because he was excluded from — from that possibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">But generally I would say my parents really shielded me up to that time period. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">That’s about the best way I can — I can put it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  So you said you were taken out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> almost immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  And then what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  I was enrolled in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> with obviously, Jewish students, but not a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So, there were no — there — there was — there were no re — Jewish religious courses given. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">It was taking the regular curriculum within a October 15, 2010 framework of Jewish teachers and — and just a framework of — of Jews — Jewish children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Do you recall some friends or friendships from that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Yes, Ido. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">We — we get a—a bulletin from the municipality of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , where I recognized a young lady — a young lady — a— a—a person’s name, and I wrote to her, and she sent me back, she recognized my name immediately, and I don’t know how, and sent me back a picture of our class, which was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So yes, I — I- I think that’s the — the only person that I — that I have recog — I have a memory thereof. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">When we — when we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , we had — when we — I should sa — correct this; when children were fortunate enough to leave <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , to go out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in some fashion or other, we would all have little autograph books and we would sign off on a little note to that st — t-to that boy or girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Maybe it was just putting our name and saying in German, best wishes for the future, maybe a little poem, maybe a little picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But I do have a book like that at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , with about — the names of about maybe 15 to 20 different students, and — and likewise a — a number of teachers who — whose classes I attended, wishing me well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  Since you went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , I suppose most of your friends came from that circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Do you recall having any Gentile friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  No, I don’t — do not, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">October 15, 2010
QUESTION:  What are your first memories of Nazis or Nazism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  I th—I think probably that experience in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was probably the — the — the first experience that I had at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My parents were no longer able to subdue their — their thoughts as to trying to shield and protect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And I do remember very clearly that either with my father or my mother, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> nearby, and the — the merchant, the owner of that <span class="BUILDING">establishment</span> , who knew my parents, looked at me with my blond hair at that time, and said, he doesn’t look like a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And that scared the hell out of me, because I knew what that meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And then in 1938, obviously the — my father and — and I, every Sunday would go to a <span class="DLF">park</span> that was like two or three minutes away from our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we would sit on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and my father would schmooze, if that’s the correct word, with neighbors who would come by. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And my father delighted in showing me off as — as his son, and — and then one day we could no longer sit on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">park bench</span> , we had to sit on a— on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">yellow bench</span> , which said, nur fir Juden, for Jews only. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And several times when we did that, we sat down, we were stoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  That means people threw stones at you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Threw stones, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  How did your father react, what did he do? </span><span class="sentence" id="110">October 15, 2010
ANSWER:  My father always said to me, I always — I told my father the last time that I went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> with him that I was afraid for my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And my father said to me that he had fought for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in World War I, and nothing would happen to me, that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had had waves of anti-Semitism previously, they come and they go, and because of our — of our nature, of what my father has achieved, what he had done, he would protect me, and nothing would happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Whether he actually believed that, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It di-didn’t — after those words, while they were encouraging, I have to tell you that I honestly did not feel very much better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  Do you remember a moment where you started feeling unease, or fear, or did it just build gradually?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  It built gradually, and I — I think it gradually — and the — the — the heightened moment of fear was about a week or two weeks prior to Kristallnacht, when as I said, we went to — we, my father and I, went to services generally every Friday evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And on this particular Friday evening, uniformed members of brown shirts, black shirts, call 1t whatever you want, uniformed Nazis, came into the <span class="DLF">front door</span> of our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and threatened — threatened the congregation, threatened our rabbi, and our rabbi was magnificent in defending us verbally, and ultimately the Nazis retreated. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And at that moment, as I said, when we walked <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I told my October 15, 2010 father I was afraid for my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Then two weeks later, you know, we experienced Kristallnacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  I’m going to ask you about that in just a moment, but I’d like to get back to your nanny. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">You mentioned that she was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Do you recall how long she stayed in your <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , and when she would have to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  I —I think — by the time I was six years old, I did not have one any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So my — my recollection of her are more — more photographic than — than anything that might have transpired between us. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I will say this, that on Kristallnacht, my parents, by some fluke of miracles, were not with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">They were on vacation, and I learned later on that my father really, physically was not doing well. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">But they were not with us, and I was with my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">My grandmother had a non-Jewish worker — servant in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I think — I certainly can recall that — that she told my grandmother that she needed to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because something — something was going to happen that evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  So what did your grandmother do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  Really nothing, except to — she was a very, very tight — tightfisted. [</span><span class="sentence" id="130">knocking]
QUESTION:  One moment. [</span><span class="sentence" id="131">break] You had said that you were with your grandmother on Kristallnacht —
ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">October 15, 2010
QUESTION:  — and that one of the people who worked for her had warned her that she should leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  No, that — that she was going to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  She was going to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  She was not — she was not going to stay all day, that — that she had some ideas that something of an — she wouldn’t say what, and maybe she didn’t even know, but she felt that she should not stay there all day, and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And my grandmother was a very primped, starched lady, never smiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">You know, it’s one of those grandmothers that — you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And I experienced Kristallnacht in her hou — in — in her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And unfortunately, her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that she lived in overlooked the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , over — was — e-even though our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was a block or two — I think one block away, I think we were on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> where we could look and see the top of our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And I could see the — you know, I could see the fires bursting through the — through the <span class="DLF">roof</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  So, can you describe basically that day, and/or that night to me? </span><span class="sentence" id="142">What happened in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that you were, and what were you seeing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Well that — that night I — I was in my — my grandmother’s <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , I had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that was mine, that was facing out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , that overlooked a block away that — what did overlook our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And during the night, two uncles of mine October 15, 2010 came. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">One on my mother’s side, who hid in a <span class="INT_SPACE">linen closet</span> , one on my father’s side, who hid underneath the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> that I was supposed to be sleeping in. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And the only th — only thought wi — these are terrible thoughts to have — the only thought that I had, that if my uncle is found underneath my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , should the Nazis come and invade the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I would be taken also. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So I really hadn’t — had little — little hope that I would live through the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I heard all the screams of the — of — of what was — what might be or what was going on in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> below us. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And — and every knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , my heart — was everybody’s heart in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> stopped — stopped running, because we all — always thought that maybe the Nazis would come to — to the <span class="DLF">door</span> , break in the hou — break into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , search the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and only — God only knows what would happen at — at that particular point. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">It was the most horrific night of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I have never, never, never experienced a night of fear, that I did on that night, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And I remember it to this day, and I will remember it for the rest of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  What happened in the morning, and did anyone end up breaking in that night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  No, we’re — as luck would have it, there were no, other than neighbors just checking on us and so forth, and my two uncles, I said, who came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and sought sanctuary — shelter. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was not broken into. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">The next morning, I left the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I don’t know how in the hell my — my grandmother would ha — October 15, 2010 would have let me go, but she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And I walked myself back to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which was maybe five minutes away, to see whether our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> had been broken into — our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> had been broken into. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And what I — what I saw ... indescribable.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  No, I did not go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I saw the <span class="DLF">door</span> was closed, I saw there was no damage to the outside of the — of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">But when I came out, we were just maybe a hundred yards away from a— from a square, and I — I’ve told my children this, there was a huge stain on the — on the <span class="DLF">pavement</span> , on the — and one of the Nazis asked another one, what is that? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And he said, that is the blood of a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Every <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in our — in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> that was Jewish owned had been broken into, had been vandalized, had been vandalized, not only broken into and — and — and — but it was painted Jew, star of David, and it was — it was the most — and — and people were cheering. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">That was the beginning of death.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Where did you end up going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  I think ultimately I went back to my grandmother’s <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">October 15, 2010
QUESTION:  Did you find members of your family there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">My — my — in the meantime, I think my — my — my mother and father had called, because they had heard — I don’t know where they were, but they were on vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">They had heard what had gone on, and I think my grandmother told them to stay away and not come back from where they — and they did not come back for several days later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  How were you reu-reunited with an adult at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Well, I stayed with my grandmother until my — until my parents returned from wherever they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  What happened when your parents returned?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  For me it was just a continuation of fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And I think — I think at that time, I think we — I think my parents showed fear for the first time as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Openly. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I’m sure they were — they were — they were in fear previously. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">My father, as I found out later on, had to take on a non-Jewish partner into the business, in order for the business to continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And that happened maybe a year or two years even before that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I didn’t know the reasons for 1t, why someone else had to be taken in the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">But these were things that were kept from me, to shield me as much as possible from a family, a Jewish family, that was descending into <span class="NPIP">hell</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  How soon after — October 15, 2010
ANSWER:  I do know — do know one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">That during this time period, my father was always was — was cognizant of the need to help those that were less fortunate, that could not help themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And I remember on several occasions, my father would ask my mother to load up a bag of groceries, as me to u — to take some of my best toys, and he had a list of — of names of people that we would drive to, and we would walk up in the apar — to the <span class="BUILDING">apartment dwellings</span> , and be greeted by name, sometimes just with smiles, and my father would always hand them an envelope, and I knew that that was mor — was money, and you know, these people were so thankful. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And I’m sure none of them survived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  At this point, were you still living in your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> or <span class="BUILDING">house</span> — at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  Yes, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Immediately after my — my parents returned, which was within days after Kristallnacht, I returned and we lived in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> until — until I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  When did you first hear that you were leaving? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">How was the news broken to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  Well, let me take you back in time a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Kristallnacht was November 9", 1938, and I don’t know the reasons for it, but in — sometime in December of 1938, on a winter day, I was walking with my sister, not far from — from where our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was, and something within me, I lashed out — physically I lashed out at a October 15, 2010 — at a member of the Hitler youth who was collecting money for whatever, whatever the purpose was, I have no idea, okay, for whatever the Hitler youth was collecting money for. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And when I say lashed out, I’m talking about physically assaulted. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And inflicted damage to the uniform, inflicted damage to that person. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">My sister dragged me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , told my — my — my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I guess they found out very quickly who it was, that individual that I had accosted. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I cannot give you the reason for it, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And at that juncture, the — my p — my parents, my mother, contacted the parents of this individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I can’t even tell you whether it was male or female that I accosted, but I do know the individual was a good — good head taller than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">That I can tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">My mother promised to pay whatever damages they — they wanted to have for this incident not to be reported to the Hitler youth leader, which could possibly lead to my being taken away permanently. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">That did not happen, and a week or two later, I found myself with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We went to what’s considered a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> in this — in this Hitler youth leader’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , where I was going to be judged one way or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Either I wasn’t coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , or something would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And I guess my mother gave me my life for the second time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything about that court proceeding? </span><span class="sentence" id="214">October 15, 2010
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Tha-That — I heard my mother screaming, crying, pleading, begging and myself sitting silently in an — an outside room, because I was not immediately in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I cannot tell you the — the words that were exchanged, but certainly the description I’ve given you 1s accurate, I know that it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And then after a while, I was called into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and my mother said — I was told in advance that if I had the chance to apologize, to do so, and I apologized in the most profuse manner that I could, and my life was spared. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">My mother gave me my second life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  What happened next? </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Did your parents get a sense that they needed to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  I think I — and again, here’s where the guesswork comes in. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">An eight year old 1s not told too much, an eight year old, and maybe today they are, but in those times an eight year is told what to do and when to do it and how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And at that point, I am sure my mother and father must have thought how they were going to get me out of — out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and do it fast, before anything changes, before — before somebody in the Hitler youth group that had decided — by the way, my — my parents, my mother dis — paid a — a very substantial fine, I was told — before someone changed their mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I think that — my guesstimate is that I got onto the Kindertransport list possibly a little faster, and maybe I got onto the list at all because of — of this terrible incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And I left — I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> sometime in — October 15, 2010 towards the end of January. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So roughly about a — within four weeks after this — after this incident, I was out of — out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  What were you told, where were you going to be going and why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  Well, we had — we had had papers to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for some time, except that they were taken out rather late. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">My — my parents, or my mother had a third or fourth cousin living in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , somebody who I’d never met, somebody whose name I’d never heard of before. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">But anyway, they had given us the affidavit to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">What was lacking to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was the quota number, because my parents, my mother, my father, I guess, always believed to the end that things would not get to that point in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So we — we had the affidavit, but no quota number to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Had we stayed and had I stayed in — in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> — or had I stayed in, excuse me, had I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for my quota number to appear from the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> there, I would have been dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So I went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and my — my — my family did have — did have — we did have family in — in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , but I was bounced around all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> in — in — in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , including I lived with a wonderful Christian family in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> about two and a half hours north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> for about half a year or so, and went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">They shared what they shared with — whatever they had they shared with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They were wonderful, caring, giving people, and only a year ago, did I lose contact October 15, 2010 with — with that family. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">We would exchange Christmas cards or Thanksgiving cards, and it was only last year that I finally failed to get a card, and that — as a matter of fact, only recently, I wrote to the ca — the municipality, asking whether they had any records as to what might have happened to this, you know, person of that — of that family. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So I’m — I’m very, very grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And you should know Kindertransport, I mean, people tell you, Kindertransport came about because of a group of Quakers persuading Parliament to take action, and — which — that allowed 10,000 un-unaccompanied children to enter <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So Christians have been very, very good to me, and | have a great love and admiration for — for Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And to this day, where I participate in a lot of Christian activities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  We do want to hear about your time in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and exactly how that unfolded, but let’s go back a bit to the Kindertransport itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Do you recall the date?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  End of January, or — and it — when I say end, roughly of — I’ve tried to look that up several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">To the best of my abilities to come up with records, it looks like the third week in January. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">That’s why I said roughly about a month after this terrible incident, which was an act of sheer stupidity on my part. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">It wasn’t bravery, it was stupidity that could have cost me my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I — I should have wound up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> or in one of the — probably in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and — and that only the love of my mother pleading kept me from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">October 15, 2010
QUESTION:  Do you recall the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> itself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  Yes, I remember standing on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , on the <span class="BUILDING">Hauptbahnhof</span> , and that — and the — the — the Nazi official calling out the list of names. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And I remember that my name was not immediately called on the first go-round. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">All the other names were there, and I started to cry, because I knew down deep in my heart, that if I didn’t get out, 1t would cost me my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Now that’s a hell of a thought for an eight year old to have, but those were my thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And — and I cried, and my mother and father who I re — I already separated from, they were standing on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and I was on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , we had already had our goodbyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And my mother said, he doesn’t want to leave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And I didn’t have the courage to tell her that the reason I was crying because my name wasn’t — was not on the list, and my life wasn’t going to be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And then the second go-round, my — my name was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Yeah, it was — it was a horrendous — horrendous day at a <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , parents and children were — were kissing, hugging. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Most children would never see their parents; I was fortunate to some degree, but nevertheless, whatever the circumstance was, for the child and parent, it was traumatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Absolutely traumatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">What — what parent today would part with their seven, eight year old, nine year old, 10 year old, no, doesn’t really matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And say, and realize that it might be the final goodbye hug or kiss that they would — would receive. </span><span class="sentence" id="263"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Train</span> — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went to — went to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We October 15, 2010 sat — I remember sitting on — I should tell you, I — we were allowed — Kindertransport told us that — that each child could bring along one specified size suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I should tell you about two weeks before that time, my father took me to the leading <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and bought every suit that he could — that I had an eye on, and he was going to deck me out in as many suits and coats and jackets as he could find, and — and ultimately it was all reduced down to nothing, because all those things had to be left behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  Did they have to be left behind before you packed, or was 1t somehow on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> —
ANSWER:  Yes, yes, this all had to — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> — the only thing we could take on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was one small suitcase, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Whatever fit in that suitcase was fine, but seven or eight suits were not going to fit into that suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So — but my father always wanted to do the best for — for — for me, all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">QUESTION:  Once you’re on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , what was happening? </span><span class="sentence" id="270">How many kids were around you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  I—I would s — I would say — well, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> — we — we sat in a — each — ea — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was sectioned off with little <span class="INT_SPACE">compartments</span> , and each <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> had maybe six or eight chil — six or eight people, in this case children, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And all I can tell you 1s that I think we all sat stone-faced, afraid to say a word, either to October 15, 2010 each other, or to anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We were told to be as quiet as possible, not to say anything, not to say anything at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And 1t wasn’t until we crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> that some words were said to — between each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  So you were aware of the <span class="DLF">border crossing</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  Do you —
ANSWER:  And we were aware at that point before — before — obviously before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , 1n going across the <span class="DLF">border</span> at that — at both junctures, Nazis came on, and — to inspect our — our documentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Which was also a terrible moment because God forbid they’d saw something that we were unaware of, that might cause you to be pulled off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Which did not happen, to the best of my knowledge, but that thought was always with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  What happened once the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was in <span class="REGION">Dutch territory</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">ANSWER:  I don’t know where — ultimately we were given food. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We were g — we — we were given food and hot chocolate, and it was welcomed. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">The ultimate <span class="DLF">port</span> that we went to, I can’t tell you the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And we then embarked o-on — some people may call it a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I call it a terrifying <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ride across the <span class="DLF">English channel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Terrifying because the waves, and I think everybody got seasick. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But terrifying only from — from the October 15, 2010 physical aspect of — of crossing water, by crossing a — a rather — I would say — not a dangerous body of water, but certainly a body of water that was not smooth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  Do you remember arriving in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">From there — from — again, I don’t know the — the name of the <span class="DLF">port</span> that we arrived at, but from there we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and where we were welcomed by lots of individuals, organizations, people. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">You know, little bit of normalcy crept into — there wasn’t any normalcy in our lives, none.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  Di-Did you know anyone on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  No, nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I should say — or, I ta-take that back, my sister was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">But I don’t remember whether she sat with me in my <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">QUESTION:  We haven’t spoken about your sister yet, was she — is she older, younger?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">ANSWER:  Yeah, she’s seven years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So as far as I’m concerned, my sister was a — and I’m not denigrating, or talking down about my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">But my sister was a person that I really had little relationship with as I was growing up, because she was a completely different age group than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So my sister was a — a sister in — 1n name, but not in actuality, if — if — if —1if I can say that a — openly and honestly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  So the two of you tra-traveled together to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  Correct.</span></p>
