<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION: Ben, we are going to begin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Please tell me your name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER: My name presently is Benjamin Meed, but this was not my real name...of my real name was much longer, was Benjamin Miedzyrzecki, which is very difficult to pronounce and to spell in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And so therefore it was shortened to Meed, the first four letters of my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I also was known during...1n the underground as . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And therefore many people who remember me from the first years of liberation and the underground call me Czeslaw. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">But actually mine... was born under the name of Benjamin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION: Tell us where you were born. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and...uh...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where I lived, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ...I...1n those days people were giving...were born mostly in the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and I was one of those from that generation...was born in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I lived, probably until the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Uh...So I lived there a long time with my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Uh...We were...my immediately family in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we were four children in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of my parents and...uh...we were born...uh... We all were...all our children are born on the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was <span class="BUILDING">Pawia 31</span> in the heart of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION: Tell us a little bit about your family and your childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER: My...my family and my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">When I look back at my childhood, I count..what was my childhood? </span><span class="sentence" id="14">How many years was my childhood? </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Today when I compare it with my own children and my grandchildren...uh...my childhood...uh...was only a few years. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">At the age of 4 I was sent to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I come from a very <span class="BUILDING">religious home</span> and at the age of 5, it was not only me, but my entire family. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Every child at the age of 5 supposed to know Hoolish and...uh...to recite Chumash, the Bible. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And uh...I was sent in mine childhood to a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> where I learned Jewishness, Hebrew, religion for five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Uh...This was in the age between 6 and 5 and 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Uh...Then...uh...1 was very involved...I was very active in...in the under...in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I was allowed many friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We played ball in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Some of us...we couldn't afford to have a ball because this was too luxurious so we were playing with some stacking stuff with...uh...with garbage and this was our ball. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I will never forget that there always was the...if the ball will fall into...uh...to a <span class="NPIP">wet spot</span> , become so heavy, I never could have touched, and if you were hit with such a ball I remember it was...uh...very painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And also all the water was splashed over you, and I'll never forget the...the wet balls which we were playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Uh...I don't know I was always...uh...1in that group of the children...I was very active and...uh...I spent a lot of time also playing in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , all in the <span class="DLF">back yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I only had to make sure that my homework is made because my mother had to inspect my homework every night and then my older sister...she was inspecting everything which was in Polish because she was going to the <span class="BUILDING">Polish schools</span> ...<span class="BUILDING">Polish gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">In my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and...uh...like in other <span class="BUILDING">house</span> much more attention was given to the education of the girls than...than the boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Boys got all kinds of educations, but the girls were spent to special <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So mine sister was the...the more educated in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and she was also the oldest so she was always...uh...watching over our homework. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And...uh...after 5 years, I became a rebel and I said that I don't want to go just to a <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I want to go to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and I insisted I am going to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">For my parents it was a little bit, you know, painful that I don't want to go on with the only Yiddish education, Hebrew education, but I want to get, you know, the general education. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But I won that battle as a youngster and...uh...finally mine parents...uh...agreed that I should go to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Maybe basically they agreed because it was also much more economical. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">In the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> we didn't have to pay anything, and the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , which was very expensive to us...for us, and...uh...and I joined that <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> and I was a very, very pleased and happy good student. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">There I was not only with Jewish children, I was together with...uh...Catholic boys, friends and I developed...uh...large friendship among these groups, young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We belong also to the sport clubs and...uh...the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> left on me a tremendous mark on my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Uh...All my teachers were of my idols. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I was very lucky with teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I...I think and some other kids thought that way about their teachers that we had the best teachers in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">They really cared for us and they taught us, and I have a lot of respect for the teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Uh... The teacher played a very important role in my life, and...uh...to some extent...uh...even mine parents became jealous. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Why do I listen so much to the teachers and...uh....not paying enough attention for...for our rules for generations were established in my family and...uh...the main rules were...the...we call it in Yiddish... , that means respect for the parents and...uh...although my father never hurt me...my father never raised a hand on...never laid a hand on me, but I was always afraid for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He was the authority and...uh...the authority was also in a sense, you know, when we had to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and...uh...eating, we never...none of us would sit down at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> if Father will not come in to sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">This was a way of respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Also because of the language, we never addressed our parents on a first name...you. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I never turned to my Father and said, "You will do this." </span><span class="sentence" id="51">That will be disrespect. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So we always addressed Father and Mother in the way...Mother do or Father do...but we never tell them you should do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Uh...You will do it, but...uh...always that gave a distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION: Tell me a little bit about your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER: My family...uh...
QUESTION: You came from a large family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER: I came from a very...all Jewish families were large. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I came from a family which was for generations living in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My grandfather which was great grandfather which was well known in the...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , had a laundry business, and his name was . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">It was a very well known laundry. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He had 18 children and...uh...I don't remember now the names of all the children, but I was a youngster coming to the...for all the holidays to my great grandfather and I remembered big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">It's like a...like a <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">There were three <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> which were opened the <span class="DLF">walls</span> in order to accommodate all the people, and we sat at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">My grand great father had, as I said, had 18 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">My grandfather had 9 children, and I come from a family of 4. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I don't know if the calculation is correct, but I think we were between 300 to 400 people of one family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> under the same name. . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And it was a Hasidic family, all belonging to the Hasidic sect of the Alexander Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We all...uh...assembled...uh...on Saturdays, especially on Saturdays. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We came to the same <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and on holiday, we definitely made sure that we are in one the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Even people which were out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had to come back and to be in the same <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> praying together. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">That I think 1t was something like a tradition that wherever you were...but for the High Holidays, we all came together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION: What happened when the Nazis came?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER: When the Nazis came I already was...uh...grown-up. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">What you call grown-up, a teenager in mine age was a grown-up. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">As a teenage I already was earning a living, going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the same time working, earning a living, being responsible for helping the family, being responsible for helping the education which was very ____—_—~went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">It was very expensive, so I had to earn money to pay for the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , help with my sister, and...uh...1 was very much already involved in...1n...uh...organizational life before the war because mine generation grew up in a...generation of idealism. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Most of my friends belonged to organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Zionists. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Bundists. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Socialists. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Religions groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">We have all kind of groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And we all had...uh... outlooks on life and we were already...we were...we were knowledgeable about the...the possibilities of...uh...of war ...of the expansion policies of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ...uh... The first feelings of war came to us when <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was incorporated, the Anschluss. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Then it was the...the taking over by the Poles, part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ...uh, I don't know it was a pact among <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to divide part of the <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and...uh...we already saw more and more militaristic movements and we were prepared that something had happened, but we didn't...were not prepared it'll happen so rapidly and that's why when the German attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> September Ist, they called it "blitzkrieg" [Ger: "Lightning War"]. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We were...were looking at the...at the American...at the Polish Army, which was already beautiful dressed, the officers of beautiful shiny shoes and we really looked at them like a...a real defense group which will be able to defend the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But...uh... shockingly enough, I think all the <span class="DLF">military lines</span> were broken by the Germans within one day, and within the second day, the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was bombarded wherever you were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And we were not even prepared that they are...when we saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> flying we...everybody said it's our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">It's our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We did not realize that we did not have an air force anymore that last...the first two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And there were the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> flying over us, bombarding us, and within a few days <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was...uh...encircled by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I think it was...uh...September 7, when...uh... over the radio came...uh...the appeal that all people which are able to carry weapons, men specially, are being asked to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and to go to the east where new <span class="DLF">defense lines</span> are being created. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I was attached so much to my family and I felt that even we are already everyday hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> I couldn't leave my family and I did not...uh...follow that appeal, but most of my friends left on that day and they went east toward the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We did not even know in that days that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ...that the decision was made that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> will be divided between Russian and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but we felt that it is safer to go toward <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , especially those who believed in the...in the possibilities of a socialist communist government felt that the haven will be found on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> where we had...uh...believed that...uh...after all it's a communist regime, a more humanitarian regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">We knew very little really about the true...what is...what it is that government. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And...uh...a lot of people left, but I choose to be with my family, and I did not leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And I was waiting in...with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> went through that...was 30 days until the Germans were occupy <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> because we were...defending <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We were doing everything to help each other, but we couldn't do anything against the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> which were bombarding and thousands upon thousands of people...civilians were killed from the German bombardment, Jews and non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">In those days...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> we were free...we felt as Polish citizens defending the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and putting up the last stand against the Germans, not allowing them to come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And that came until the day when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> capitulated. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">The war came to an end, and the Germans marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Then starts a different chapter of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We were all hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I do remember the first days when the German came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">It was a parade. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I was not coming to that parade because it's not in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I was living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> , but I recall that...1 know that people told us there was a parade in the...in the main where the Germans...the victorious Germans marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And...uh...everybody was more interested in that time in finding a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Finally, we heard that a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> arrived at the corner not far where I was living and...uh...they were giving out bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So naturally I was the first one of the family...the young people, me and my brother and my sis...my sister, we all runned to...to the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they giving...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> ...uh the bread arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And...uh...that's true. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with looking only at the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with bread, our eyes shined up that we're going to get a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">There was so many people were waiting in the <span class="DLF">line</span> , the bread was not given out. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">There were two Germans on the...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> throwing out the breads and there're...and I saw they were at that time cameras filming this whole thing, how they're throwing bread to the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And I was also waiting to grab a loaf of bread, but...uh...somehow I was recognized by one of my neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">He says, "What are you doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="116">This is bread for the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I says, "So I am here." </span><span class="sentence" id="118">He says, "You're a Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="119">That was the first day when I was probably shocked and will never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I left the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I came back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and didn't bring bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Mine brother, he was more lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And my sister was more lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They came back with bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Each one of them had a loaf. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I who supposedly was the good organizer...supposed to bring the bread, came back with nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I was very much shocked that this was said to me to a man whom I knew and he said the bread are for Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And all of a sudden I who grew up with ideas of Poles was hurt that...look at this, my own Polish comrade, my own Polish neighbors are calling me, "The Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I know that...uh...there was a note of the anti-semitism before war, but I did not see it because I didn't want see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I only saw the goodness in the Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I saw goodness in every people. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But I will not forget that first day when my eyes of the hunger saw the bread and just was so abused that I went back without bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  What then happened?</span></p>

the restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">There was already talk about putting us...uh...Jews were not allowed to have any business. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Jews were not allowed to have any jewelries, Jews were not allowed...all the restrictions started to come of us, and then the young people were supposed to go to work, and you could have buy out yourself of not working and pay somebody else to go to work, but the Jewish community had to deliver every day working battalions to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And life became, you know...uh...we had to adjust ourselves to the reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">That went down until probably February or March. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I happened to meet a friend on the <span class="DLF">street</span> which was one of the leaders of the youth movement where I belong. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Uh...He was Mr. Borenstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">He was an accountant, a very intelligent fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And he was very pleased to...to meet me and he asked me of my address. </span><span

class="sentence" id="287">About 2 weeks later he came to see me in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...uh...and he asked me if I would like to join the underground movement, which I did, and I became a member of the underground in the early 40s. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We were divided in the underground that I only knew five people of my group. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Uh...One of the five...uh...all of them were very good people...was the daughter of Mr. Dawidowicz, which was later on the...the husband of Lucy Dawidowicz. </span><span class="sentence"

she was one of the five which belonged, and then we organized other youth...uh...events. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We...[ became in contact...I started...was chosen as the leader of the five and...uh...so I had the occasion to meet another five. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">But really I did not know too many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I was very, you know...we met regularly every week, but mainly our activities, strange enough, was involved around culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">We did not...our activities was to prepare culture events, to run an illegal <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">That was...uh...most of our activities were and to listen to the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">We...that was the work for maybe for a year or two, just...uh...the underground was a cultural organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I was responsible of making sure to maintain the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> to...and to make sure to deliver the books. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">People were reading books. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">People were anxious to...to exchange the books in those days where already the curfew and...uh...there were the house committees created. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">When I look back today about the time when these restrictions came but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was created, I think every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> became a community because at 7 o'clock we had to remain in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and I was...uh...1n that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I was living, probably at 31, as a young man and when a community was created, I became the secretary of the community...of my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And that were again community life and...uh...since there were no <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> ...all <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were illegal... organized a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="BUILDING">mine building</span> , and I became the teacher of that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I was...I had never had a preparation of being a teacher, but teaching was mostly...uh....singing together with the children, keeping them together and the children came very, very eagerly to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because part of their work was a soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And everybody of the children was waiting when will we get that soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Soa child was...the children were so hungry so that coming to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> is because they knew that during the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> hours they will get a soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And that was the most important thing why they came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Then I was...uh...by coincident, I was given a job when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was created already, to work in a battalion on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">That probably...uh...was a very important moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I did not know after months I for the first ttme came out...out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to work in such a battalion. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">The work of that battalion was...uh...to... to...all the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> which were burned out, standing like ...like skeletons...uh....to demolish them, but not demolish them by demolish because the bricks were very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So we had to take...go on the top of a burned-out <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and little by little take off every brick and clean it because later on these bricks were used for building other <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...<span class="BUILDING">building</span> , not for the...they were shipped out from the...after we cleaned them, they were shipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">These were not for rebuilding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">It was for...for wherever the Germans need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And I was in such a battalion working, and somehow I came to the...uh...very...was...very...very helpful that I was able to buy during the day for the exchange of all kinds of clothing which I brought from the...from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and...uh...the Poles to us and were selling bread against...exchanging against...uh...potatoes, against that clothing which we brought out and this was a tremendous help if I was able to come back with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> which 1s also illegal and brought back some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So it was not a question of getting a pay or pay for the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">It was a question how much can I bring back to feed the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And...uh...somehow we were guarded by...uh...a German...older Germans which were probably mobilized as...uh...to...not for duties on the frontiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And there was one German who was in our group, used to come every morning...uh...to take us out from the <span

class="sentence" id="323">It was probably a man in the 50's, an older man or in 40s, late 40s or 50s. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">But he never screamed. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">There were others that were screaming cause we were...we were even afraid for the screaming of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">He was never screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">That means he was a good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And whenever I turned to him, asking him for permission can I go across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , can I buy a...can I take some water or can I buy a loaf of bread, whatever it is, he would always let me do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And he was very much attached. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Uh...One day he showed me the pictures of his children. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And he looked at the...one of the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">He says, "Here is a...my son. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">He's in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">He's like you." </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I did not understand what he means, he's like you. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">He said, "He's in your age. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">It's the same like your age." </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And...uh...[ don't know what went through this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">He never spoke, but somehow he thought about his son, and he looked at me sometimes and he says, "He's like you." </span><span class="sentence" id="340">He's my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I don't know what he wanted to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">If he is like you...1f he's Jewish or if he's like you as a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">But he...he was tremendously helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">The underground, which I belonged, found out which there're doing the work that I was very much...have good possibilities of going out every day to the...with the battalion on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> and coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">The underground started to get interested in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And...uh...once...uh...somebody of that...the underground went with me and he came back the same night. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">He disappeared in the middle of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I don't know where he went, but he wanted probably to check out the way we are going 1n and going out. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And we had to be counted in the morning how many went out and how many came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Nobody asked for names or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">We just were counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">After a week of this...uh...going in and out, I got again a visitor from the underground who came to me...to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he says, "I want you to know from now on, when somebody will come and will give you that passport you accept him to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">We understand it...the problem that somebody has to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">We will always send somebody with you if we will have somebody to return. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And that went out for a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And that was a tremendous good channel for the underground of sending people...of exchanging between the...I was...uh...just a simple person in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I did not have any leadership role, so I really did not know exactly what they were preparing and what they were doing, but I felt...uh...like a doing a service. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And...uh...this went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I also was able to contact on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> some people which became very friendly in the beginning for buying and I made contact with them that even once during the boarding on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , I asked the German fellow...the...the soldier who was guarding me if I...I can leave for 2 hours, and I went to a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">For the first ttme I came into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> after years in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and to see the way Poles are leaving everything normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Everything when down a normal life, and that lady, Juliana Persch...uh... gave me a proposal that I can try to bring my family to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and told my father about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">In the beginning, he didn't want to hear about this. "</span><span class="sentence" id="364">What do you mean, we're gonna to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="365">But this took a few months, but later on we used that contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And we brought...I brought my parents out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I brought mine sister, the younger one, and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">My older sister was taken away, in the meantime, to...by the Germans...to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Mine...uh...(pause)...but one day at 5 o'clock in the morning when the first day...minute when the curfew was opened...uh...there was a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> of...uh...a girl who walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">My mother opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and she asked...uh...that she wants to see Benjamin. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Uh...My mother says, "What's so early. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">He still asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">He has to go to work."

Now I know that...uh...what happened with her that she had...uh... documents...the map of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> which was drawn in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> by people who came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> to be sent by the underground and...uh...to...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So we had to bring it out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">She was carrying that document. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">While she was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">booth</span> ...while she was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">booth</span> , the only thing which I know that her name was Feiga and Vladka, with two names she gave me. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">While she was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">booth</span> , some commotion started and a shooting started on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and the German left her alone, not completing the search and run out to see what's the shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And there was a shooting about another group, not in the group with our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">She rapidly dressed herself and she came up with me to the group because we could not leave until and she...we walked...we were given permission to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And she was not completely searched. (</span><span class="sentence" id="398">Sigh) Today, I should, you know if I recall it, you know, later on when I found out what she was carrying, I don't think that I would risk the life of the whole group because if that document will be found on her, probably the whole hundred people or whatever, all of us will be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I don't know if I would make that decision of risking the life of the people, but I did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And...uh...she was also not ...uh... prepared that she will be...normally we were not searched. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Anyway, after we went through and she came out and dressed and after we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> a few blocks, she jumped off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and I never saw her. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I saw her later. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Uh...This girl later on was...uh...[ met her when I came to the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">This all story the way I met her. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I asked for her because I wanted to know what happened with that girl and when I came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> a lot of time the people of the underground asked me if I met Vladka on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , and I really did not know who is that Vladka. (</span><span class="sentence" id="406">Sigh) She was...she got very acquainted with me and I asked...1 met another man on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> and I kept asking if they ever know how I can contact her. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">This was the time when I already decided to live on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I already got the passport from the underground, not to be part of anything particular on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , but just the...the underground gave me...uh...without any assignment, they gave me a passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Uh...Zygmunt...uh....Frydrych, which was killed the first days of the Warsaw ghetto uprising brought me that passport; and...uh...1 assumed the name Czeslaw (Miedzyrzeck1). </span><span class="sentence" id="410">The passport...uh...with all the stamps, all the photographs, all the recommendation and that's how I became Czeslaw Miedzyrzecki on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And I asked for that girl during...in the...on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , living as a Christian boy already. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I asked for Vladka. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Finally, somebody made a date for me to meet at 11 o'clock at the front of the <span class="DLF">monument</span> on a certain day. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I don't recall today exactly when was that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And...uh...here came Vladka. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Uh...When she heard about me, she immediately said that she agreed to meet with me and...uh...that was our date, first date on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">She as a full blooded Christian girl, you know, very well dressed and...uh...posing with a lot of her energy. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I was a little bit timid, afraid...uh...scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I was not so sure of myself, but we had that date and that's how we started to have that...uh...contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">In the beginning we met once a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Then we started to meet...uh...almost twice, three times daily, and Vladka became later on my companion, my wife, for until today. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">It was a whole history how we lived together as Christians both in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Both of us could not reveal that we have contact with each other, even to our close friends cause that would be impossible to reveal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION:  We are going to switch tapes now for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">ANSWER: Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION: Tell us a little bit about another date you had with Vladka.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER: Uh...The dates with Vladka was...uh...in the beginning.... uh... we met again...uh...on a Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We somehow developed...uh...a very comfortable relation, much more than a friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">She lost her entire family. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">When she was in the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , she knew that she had nobody left. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">All her family...the parents, their father died from hunger in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">The mother and the brother and the sister were shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> and entire family. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">She became the only person. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And...uh...while I was meeting with her, I started to look in what are she doing asking questions, not always she gave me the full answers, but she only kept tell me...I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> this week again. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I said, "What did you do there." "</span><span class="sentence" id="436">I brought out a few children from there to place them in <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And...uh...the next week, I found...I met her again, I says, "Oh, I know I have regards for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I met somebody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and....uh...he asked me about you." </span><span class="sentence" id="439">They in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> knew more about my life than I knew outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and she told me...they brought me regards from them, and she says...uh...that there probably those people were looking for regards to be able to get a contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Maybe I can help them to come on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I did not tell you the story of mine...how did I bring them...by that time I already had my entire, my living family, my father, my mother, my sister, my brother with me in hiding on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I will come back to that story a little bit later again, because it's interesting to tell which way we brought them out and what was the reaction when I came first to my parents and tell them I want to take them to the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">But...uh...little by little, I started to find out that...uh...Vladka is so emerged in that work of the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">So only on a Sunday we were able to meet because this was the free day. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">We did not have where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">We were afraid...uh...to...to go into any <span class="BUILDING">public place</span> , so we used to walk on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> ...uh...on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> where few few people goes. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">It was cold and very few people would walk there because it was too cold, but we felt quite safe there. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And most of our dates were just by walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">We never took any chance of going into a <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I was not in any <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I don't know if there were <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">But to any <span class="BUILDING">cafe shops</span> , it was an end. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">She had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they were eating...uh...and most of the members of the underground were during the week meeting there and it was a place, a public place where their eating lunches. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So on a Sunday when she was sure that none of the...her colleagues of the underground will be there, she took me to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> to eat lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">It was a very decent, cultural place where we were coming in and eating lunch there. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">It was not a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , but it was like a club maybe, but it was a place where for that when it was cold we used to sit there for hours eating lunch and talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And little by little our...she started to tell me, she got more confidence in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">She said, "Today I was able to buy two revolvers." </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I looked at her. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I says, "What do you know about revolvers? </span><span class="sentence" id="462">How do you buy it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And she told me the story how she bought the revolvers. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And she came back one day and told me that her...that she was able to test a bomb together...uh...with...uh...Mr...with Klepfisz, Michal Klepfisz, which was an engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I says, "Why are you getting involved in such thing? </span><span class="sentence" id="466">It's dangerous." </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I was more concerned about her than about the bomb and..uh... Anyway she promised me...I remember that, "I am not going to do such thing anymore." </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I don't know if she just made me feel good but I was more concerned about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I became very much attached to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And I was counting the...the hours, the days when I am going to meet again. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Now I know that...uh...our meetings did not...were not able to occur too often because she was involved in traveling to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And...uh...once she told me that she's going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> and she asked me if I knew anybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">By coincidence I knew that there was...one of my neighbors was working in a...1n a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">The...the lady's name...they are both alive...the husband, the wife, Meltzer...for they were neighbors of my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">They were working in that concen...in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So she was...she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> ...she had to look also for a contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So she asked the inmates, she came as a Christian on the other side of the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and she asked about...uh...who knew Meltzer. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Naturally Meltzer came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And she told Meltzer that she's bringing regards from Benjamin , So She had confidence because Vladka never revealed that she's Jewish to these people, but...uh...when they heard that the Christian girl is telling them that they have regards from a Jewish fellow which they know, they got confidence and she revealed that she is from the underground and she would like to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">This became a major contact for them and...uh...in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was Mr. Meltzer and there were other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Among them were also Mr. Dunop. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And Mr. Dunop...uh...she gave in that time and Mrs. Meltzer...she asked her to create a confidential group in the camp of...uh...put together a group and she will be back a week later and she will bring them whatever they need, money and documentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Vladka has it quite well written on her book on both side of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> she has a chapter about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">That's how I became a little bit more involved in know what is...what is she doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">As a matter of fact that were...Mrs. Meltzer...uh...gave a piece of paper to Vladka, and she says, "Listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Before I was taken out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , I placed my little girl with a Christian woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Her address is so and so...uh...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Praga</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And...uh...Vladka took that address and the next day, she went to visit that little girl, and she took me along. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And so for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">She took me along because probably she wanted to make sure if I identify the girl that this is correctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So the first time I was involved through her in...in the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Naturally, we came and we found that girl and we started to speak and I did not...she did not say anything that I am Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">We both arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">We came and we...we told that lady...Vladka told that lady that from now you are going to receive monthly payment because she needed that money...was a poor woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">A young girl, Emile Coska her name was. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Emile Coska. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Emile Coska. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And...uh...there was other children from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which we took over so it was twice...so the work was in the underground of helping get documentation and preparing...you know, trying to bring out children. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">But that was my first experience of actually working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I was very restless and...uh...I was in hiding together with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">From that contact which I made on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> and it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Praga</span> ___ 44, these people had their...some <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and...uh...that lady...uh...agreed to...to bring my family there, which I brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">We were about 9 people in that hiding...in a...1n a small <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> probably the size of...uh...5 yards or 6 yards, one way. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">It was a small hiding, but we were all sitting in that hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And I was the only one which was going in and out and working officially in her <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , which was a meat factory of cleaning...uh...pieces, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">It was not far from the <span class="BUILDING">slaughter house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And...uh...there were all kinds of parts of the meat which they used for...uh...for butchery after the...for butchers and I was working in that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION: How did you convince your parents to come to the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER: Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Well, I came back to my parents after working already daily, and they saw that the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I come back and I bring bread was from the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And they saw these deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I start...uh...working with my father and telling to him, "Listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Let's go out." </span><span class="sentence" id="514">My father was not so much convinced, but we had...we had very close friend from the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which we were living. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">He was the chairman of our...of our house committee and my father was very close with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">He was...uh...uh...more, you know...uh...he was not...he was not a practicing so deeply religious Jew, like my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">His name was Ziferman, and when he heard that idea, he said to my father, "Listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I want you to go with your son, and I would like to join you, but if you don't want to go at least give me a chance to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So Mr. Ziferman convinced my father that we should go to the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">He had a only son, Adam no...Adam. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">They changed the name to Novak. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Mr. Ziferman, Mrs. Ziferman came also later and after the war, they liberated...were liberated, came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and they only survivor they brought died already, but the surviving is the son Novak...Adam Novak. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">They changed the name on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , Adam Novak, who was born with me in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...uh...a little bit younger than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So we were the three people of the Ziferman and we were four people...or...five people of my immediate family in that small hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Finally, I convinced my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">But here came the problem of my mother.

but the night when they spent was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of Vladka and...uh...he revealed everything what was happening, but his plea was, "I came out to you to try...let's try to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And they became very involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">First of all was the plan of storming the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , which never materialized because we couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">We did not have the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">We couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">So we started to work on the plan to get them out through the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And ____ or___ showed us the way that if it is possible to come out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so why cannot larger groups came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">So they got involved how to organize the escape of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from the...because we knew that the uprising cannot succeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">At least we wanted to save the...the...fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And...uh...finally they succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">They rented two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and one day the contact was made back with the ghetto fighters and...uh...they rented the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , the truck men did not know the purpose for what they going. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">They told them about <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">moving furniture</span> , but...uh...we had some people on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> already and...uh...there was some involvement of a few Polish underground people, mainly from the...from the political movements which either on the personal basis or...uh...or sanctioned by the organizations were given to us to help us get the people out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Then one day when they succeeded in renting these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they brought the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> ...uh...near the <span class="DLF">Soboska Street</span> in...in... =, and there was a place where they opened the <span class="DLF">hatch</span> of the...of the...of the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> , and the peopled started come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Naturally, the drivers, they wanted to run away and they were stopped by underground boys with guns and they say, "You cannot drive. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">If you drive, you be killed." </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I was not present at this, but Vladka was present at this...at this taking out the people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and by 60 or 70 underground fighters were brought to the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , among them...uh...which ought to...still altve is Dr. Edelman and Tzywia Lubetkin which died in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And another ghetto fighters, but from the 70 peoples which were taken to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , I think more than half was killed in the first two weeks, either by Germans or denounced or by the Polish people and very...very small group survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Even from the 70 which were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I don't think that...uh...more than 20 were remaining in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and then from the 20, maybe 15 survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And...uh...that after this became the activity when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> was liquidated....the activities of...uh...the underground was how to help people in hiding and how to help people in their...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and contacts, and there was also a thought in those days since we know that they are <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ...this was 1943...that <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> Jews are free. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">So there was...uh...a trend how to be able to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And I was almost ready to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And in the meantime, we were living as and hiding on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> and....uh...we had a lot of losses, denunciations and...uh...Germans were very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">The Germans knew that there's a large segment of people in hiding on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , either by...uh...people...righteous people who tried to save Jews...uh...or by people who did it also by risking their lives and...but using....uh...this as a means of making a living by hiding Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Uh...Both of them...we are grateful to both of them, as long as we were able to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">But the Germans in those days knew exactly and they got a few collaborators...when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> was already liquidated, September...liquidated in May, I don't remember exactly...was it September or October, they spread the news around from it spreads that there's a possibility to buy...uh...foreign passports to be exchanged through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="739">The head of this group of that foreign passports...of that...uh...organization...the Germans were...put Mr.[Dawid] Guzik...Mr. Guzik was the head of the Joint Distribution, very well known man in the Jewish community before the war and during the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">He was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and he became the...the head of this...uh...group of repatriation. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">How he got into this? </span><span class="sentence" id="742">How he came I don't know? </span><span class="sentence" id="743">But the fact was he was in this, and he was also with two well known collaborators of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Uh...One of them is Kosoftski which openly belonged to the work of...for the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And he was even carrying...that was the only man which I saw carrying a...a revolver issued by the...by the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Naturally, Kosftski was later on killed by the underground in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">This was a later period. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And...uh...1t became a situation that was first in a...in a...1n a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in a different section. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I think it was the Royal, the name of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Then we moved...they moved to <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Polski</span> , and I would say that close to a thousand people living as...in hidings on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> were seeking to get these documentations. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">In the beginning these documentations were very expensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">You needed a fortune of money to buy such a document. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">There I used my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">I tell...[ came back and I told my father that you know the man whose the head of this thing...the repatriation 1s Mr. Guzik." </span><span class="sentence" id="755">He says, "Guzik. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">He's a close friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Take me to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I will talk to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I will make sure that you getting a passport and...uh...we'll pay him back one day whatever is necessary." </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And naturally I brought my father to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Guzik</span> , and Guzik...uh... met my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">There was very little conversation, but Guzik says, "You want me to help your son." </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And he said, "That's what I came for." "</span><span class="sentence" id="764">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Are you wanta leave?" </span><span class="sentence" id="766">He says, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I have a wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I have children. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">We are too many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Just take one of our family." </span><span class="sentence" id="771">The... Vladka used to come and I...since this was a very safe place to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span> on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> and if you came into this it was on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lugar</span> , the <span class="DLF">street</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lugar</span> I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="772"><span class="BUILDING">Lugar 25</span> I felt very safe over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">The moment you walked in you were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">It was like an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So I spent most of the time there in that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> talking to people and transports leave and Guzik sent his wife and his daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">So this was the best proof and we spoke to Guzik. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">He says, "You ask me how is it." </span><span class="sentence" id="778">He says, "I am sending my wife and my daughter." </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And it's correctly, he did send his wife and his daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">So we felt maybe it is chance and from the underground papers we knew that something was going on that the Germans are trying to exchange Jews for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">We did not know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">But the underground never got a confirmation. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">So as a result Vladka did not want have nothing to do with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Although she felt very bad that I have to leave and that's...she started to spend the last days to be with me in___, she said, "I am not going to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I am not going to leave because we don't know anything about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">We don't trust the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">She didn't trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">She didn't want to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And I decided since I am one of five people of the family, I will go and I will take a chance and see. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> left. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">The second <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I was supposed to be in the third <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">But when the third <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> left, 1t became really very...everybody could have obtained a passport, not for big money but even for peanuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">You could have...1f you knew anybody, you got a passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">If you knew anybody was leaving and you went into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> somehow everybody got a passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">So that came a little bit also suspicious to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Why...why do you giving out so these passports so easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">But in the day which I suppose to leave...uh...mine brother came the day before to say goodbye to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">But somehow, he turned to be and he says, "Listen, Ben." </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Naturally, he did not turn to me, "Listen, Ben." </span><span class="sentence" id="801">He spoke to me Yiddish or Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Uh..."You know I don't have such good features, Christian features like you. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">You are very close with Vladka. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Here you are the __ run. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Why don't you give me the passport and I will leave." </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And the passport was with my picture with my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">It wasn't a passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">It was a..some documentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Not a real passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">With a Paraguayan stamp to the <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="811">A visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> which was also fixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">It was not a...not a real visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And my brother turns to me I should give him the transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I did not think too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I pulled out the passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I gave him. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">He embraced me. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">He kissed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">He says, "Promise me. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I...you'll never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">The minute I will arrive I will let all of you know, and we will try to be reunited." </span><span class="sentence" id="822">The next day the Germans came with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to take the people for the transport and I overheard...uh... a conversation between the Germans...and I remained there because it was safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> to remain because I was watching already two transport leavings. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Uh...I overhead that the Germans says to one German to the other that he thinks that the Jews don't want to leave today. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I wanted...I tried to go to the...when I heard this, I was trying to go to the <span class="DLF">door</span> ...to open the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">The <span class="DLF">door</span> ...the <span class="DLF">door</span> was already closed with a guard on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="827">I had no chance to...to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">So I was...uh...my brother already was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">He left already. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I did not have any communication anymore with my brother and I was starting to look for a hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And I found a hiding on the...1t was not the <span class="DLF">roof</span> ...below the <span class="DLF">roof</span> there was a place where I thought that this was a proper hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Anyway, an hour later when I was in that hiding, I already start hearing shooting and screaming. "</span><span class="sentence" id="833">Raus!"--"Out! </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Out!" </span><span class="sentence" id="835">I succeeded to be in that hiding there was another people with a little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Uh...I remembered that...uh...that man who was hiding with me went through an operation a few days before. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Why...I found out from this later...of changing...changing...uh...pulling up the skin on his penis, he should like a Christian boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And he was in terrible pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">He was in terrible pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And...uh...but we laying in that hiding until the night...until it became very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Uh...My brother left before and that day and my name...under my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I never heard from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">I never knew where he went. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">People started to tell me that the transport went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> it went to...uh...by other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="845">All kinds of stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">The true is that people went from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="847">But I never heard of my brother, never know about what's happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">So officially in all the records of the German records, I probably...if they are German records, in future historians...uh...all historians which are very much, you know, interested in documentation, records will probably list me as one of the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">But...uh...1t was not me. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">It was my brother in my <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="851">I revealed...I revealed this for the first time after 4 years when I introduced the President of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> before 20,000 survivors in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="852">But I...those thoughts of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carousel</span> , of the crying of my father, of crying... mine coming back to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> helpless and crying, sitting and crying around the <span class="DLF">graves</span> , and that shooting and the...probably constantly being with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I am never free of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And sometimes when I am even very content and happy and I have a lot of reasons sometimes to be happy because I did brought up a new family and a good family. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I established a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> here, but they come back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And people asking me, "Why all of a sudden quiet down?" </span><span class="sentence" id="857">But when I quiet down it's the moments when I really go back to the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">You know people tell me that...uh...1 was responsible, as you know, during the war, after the war here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for 27 years...of creating a commemorations of probably the largest in the world beside award. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Butthe __—s award, <span class="BUILDING">Temple of Manuel</span> , and I will not forget when Rabbi Sobel one day turned to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">We had a big sign which read: WE SHALL NEVER FORGET AND NEVER FORGIVE. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And he in a very polite way turned to me one day in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , he says, "Ben. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">It's a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Our religion says that we should forgive. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I know it's going to hurt you, but we cannot have a sign in this <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> : WE SHALL NEVER FORGIVE."

<p><span class="sentence" id="878">QUESTION: Ben, let's go over a couple of items that we haven't discussed before. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Tell us a little bit about how you and Vladka got married and...uh...what happened to your parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="880">ANSWER: We are both Jewish, coming from a Jewish background. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">We lived as Christians, but...uh...when you say marriage that means that...uh...going through the formality of having a Huppah. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">This we did immediately at the first week after liberation upon the assistance, which is a story later, of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">But after the uprising, I could not stay anymore in the hiding...you stay over night. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I also became much closer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vladka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Vladka rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the corner of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gerboska_</span> and...uh...Valitsove, I think it's Gerboska_ and Valitsove. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Uh...She had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , a one-room apartment, and I used to come out from the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , and the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I can spend a night was in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="887">My parents, who got already adjusted to know Vladka because Vladka was supplying us with food, bringing...because my parents never ate any meat...in all the time when they were on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , so my Vladka used to bring some dairy products for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">She also was the protection for us because the people, the...the caretaker of the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> knew that we are being...uh...watched and protected by the underground which is Vladka and when we were supposed to take the monthly pay, Vladka was handing over the money to the people, although in the beginning it was my father's money which soon ran out of money, but...uh...we did not want to let the caretaker know that we have money so Vladka used to come every two weeks every month and pay for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And my parents uh...uh...got...got used to her, and she was our angel. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">On the other hand, Vladka, not having anybody of her own, felt very comfortable with the feelings that she comes into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where people are caring for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">This went down already for a few weeks...
QUESTION: How old was Vladka at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">ANSWER: Vladka was at this time...uh...about 19...19, 20...and..maybe 19 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="893"> And...uh... Vladka...uh...uh...used to come in quite often. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And when my parents saw that I am not coming at night, they never asked me, "Where were you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="895">But they probably, among themselves, talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">But one day when Vladka came to the hiding, my mother asked us both to come closer to her; and she was wearing a ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">She took off the ring from her finger and she said to me, "Put that ring on Vladka's hand...finger," which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And my mother said, "Let it be with good luck." </span><span class="sentence" id="899">We did not discuss it. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">We did not talk about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">But I know what my parents wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">My parents wanted at least to feel that they are not letting her son...their son just go and live with a girl without making a pledge or a vow, which is traditional before marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">This is the ring which Vladka is still wearing today. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">She never changed the ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">Whatever it was left from my mother which...memories and...uh...maybe other things, but this is the most precious thing which we have...was the ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And that was almost like an acceptance that when I come back, I didn't...I was...I was already allowed to remain with Vladka at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And we became very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">We never discussed why she was doing this, but I think that this is...uh...something which my parents...even that way of hiding wanted to continue the tradition and wanted to be at least rightful...uh...in their observances...uh...to God that not just, you know, to let us go live together without any vow why we are together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">QUESTION: Tell me about teaching Vladka to ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">ANSWER: Yes, we...(sigh) we were young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">It was...uh...we were both very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">We were in love. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I did not know how to...uh...to express some mine gratitude and mine affection with some taking out her to <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> or movies, which I was brought up in a family which was very often going to <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> , <span class="BUILDING">concerts</span> , so I did not have any recreation. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">So I decided that the best thing for me will be to buy a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> as a gift for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">But, strangely enough, when I bought the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> for her, she told me that she doesn't know to ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="916">I was sure that she knows how to ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And I bought it as a surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And I felt that it's also very good for her to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that will give her a little bit more credibility for her by her neighbors that you know...here she's not...uh...uh... reacting like just a girl which is afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And I took her...therefore, when I found out that she doesn't know how to ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> (chuckle) one Sunday I took her in an open <span class="DLF">field</span> to teach her how to ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Unfortunately, while teaching her how to ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , she fell off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and sprained or broke the ankle. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">We were really in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">She could not...the next day she could not reveal to the...to the people of the underground cause she was...uh...in daily...uh...in daily contact with the people which are heading the underground...uh...special ... uh... mecali and others...uh...people with whom she met lunchtime. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">She couldn't tell them that she'd broke the leg by meeting...going out there...would have been a crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">So she came and she had even...she could not even reveal how she broke the leg, but she was with a cast with a band aid which was done in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in an <span class="INT_SPACE">emergency room</span> , and very little, very provisional, but that...those days we could never even tell people she broke the leg because riding in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="925">What you mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="926">You in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="927">You...you ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="928">You...you'll going to have... You...you are going out with a boy having a good time." </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Her whole credibility would be under question. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">That means that she's not the only one who knows everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Maybe she shares some information with me, which she didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Very little Vladka ever told me what she was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And I was never pressing her to tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">So I really during the underground did not know exactly what she was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">But it was very embarrassing, but it's a coincidence which remains with us and...uh...but that...those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> are...were very helpful to us for the...she learned how to ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> because after the Polish uprising, we escaped due because from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other because we knew both how to ride <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> , and we escaped on those...on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="936">So it was...uh...a good...uh...thing that she learned how to ride...ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="937">Cough)
QUESTION: Let me ask you Ben. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">The...being in love in this period of time, being in love for a teenager for a young man is the happiest time in his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Seeing the world go up in smoke is the most difficult thing you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">How could you feel both things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="941">ANSWER: Uh...I would say that's very often...she was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">Uh...Many times we worked together. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Most of the time was for me to...to relieve her cause when she was with others, she did not reveal anything about what she lost...her loneness. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">She was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And I was maybe a good shoulder for her, why she was able to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">This probably was also part of the love, of expression. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">But I would...uh...I think that...uh...t's a very interesting question to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Here we were two young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">Everything what we did was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">Our whole existence was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">The work which Vladka was involved...later, I was involved in different work of the underground...was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">The people we...we met was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">But something was in us...the young...the youth...the young years, which probably you cannot suppress this, and if you...uh...you came to expression, probably our love was probably...I don't know...to measure the depthness, but was a true love. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">We did care for each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And I think our love was probably....uh...mostly based on really caring for each other, and that's why it was important for both of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">It was not just a love of...uh...of an expression of sex, which was also, but was more the love of having each other, of being able to depend on each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">She knew that she can always count on me, and I knew that I can always count on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">That love was probably more than anything else a human being has. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Uh...Today when we live in an era, we know that their love is probably expressed in the same way, but the...the attraction from...from young people is probably mainly, first of all, based on sex. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I don't exclude this...that this was not among us, but I think... think 1t was much deeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">It was much deeper and much more personal affection and personal responsibility although we cannot...we couldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Whenever she walked out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> or I walked out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , I never knew that I will come back and she never knew that she come back, and she had many of mess ups. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">She was arrested many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">I was arrested and thank God that I was not brought to...to the...to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">I was able to buy myself out. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">I was not so much like arrested that I was harassed by the ___ people who were going around looking for Jews, and I was recognized twice and luckily that I was able to buy myself out...myself out through the help of some Polish people who knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And I took them to them and they paid for me the ransom, which I later on returned because I did not carry the money with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Whatever I had with me was taken away...the watches, whatever...if I had a ring...everything was taken away, and I always wore something...had something to be able to have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And...uh... that was...uh...a close relation also. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">Our close relation became also that I was later on involved... uh...in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> in a very practical way. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I was...uh...brought into the underground as a guy who was very handy and...uh...I was asked to build hidings. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">Uh...And I was very good in it, and very...had a lot of innovated ideas. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And...uh...people which had <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ...<span class="BUILDING">houses</span> where they lived could not bring any Christian workers to work and to trust them that they're going to hid Jews in them, so they brought me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And always this was a contact arranged by Vladka. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">These uh...uh...orders to...to make these...uh...bunkers were not coming to me directly from the top leadership, but it came through Vladka, so that helped a lot our...also our close relations. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And I am very grateful to...to God forever that I was able to build a few hidings of which in which people survived...even they were discovered and that they were denounced that they're staying there, the Germans came in and they couldn't find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">I built several...uh...<span class="NPIP">places</span> where completely...uh...<span class="DLF">wall</span> matching up in their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , only taking away one feet of the...of the width of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , but a complete <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">I built hidings in...uh...1n <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">I built hidings very....which would be every difficult to even...to even think that there's possible to build. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">We had very thick <span class="DLF">walls</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and they were the <span class="DLF">window sills</span> where with very thick <span class="DLF">walls</span> , I used to take out the <span class="DLF">window sills</span> , the wood, and then scrub out all the bricks which were very thick and leave a very thin layer on the outside of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which was not touched, and inside the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was not touched and...uh...we used to...to remove the sill of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and one or two people were able to get in...in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">That's...uh...including myself, helped survive a few people. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Uh...I was sit...laying once in such a hiding for 6 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">Not hiding, because...uh...that was in Vladka's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , not hiding because I was discovered by the Germans, but the colleague of the underground came to see Vladka, a girl...uh...she's alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">She is now...uh...living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Her husband was the Professor in <span class="BUILDING">Chicago University</span> ...uh...Mr. Kane, but she came once to visit Vladka, and Vladka could not reveal that somebody is in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="986">In the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , you see, nobody knew that she is in the...she's seeing me, what she went through with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">So because of her...her coming knocking on the <span class="DLF">door</span> ... did not know who was knocking, I jumped into that hiding, and she was quite a few hours in Vladka's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I had to sit a quite a few hours in that hiding, not hiding from the Germans, but hiding that somebody of the underground should not know that I am there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="988">QUESTION: The sewer's were linked for life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and you spent both a considerable amount of time in the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> and working in the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> with people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="989">ANSWER: Uh...In the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> I spent that the...uh...the time which I spent in the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> was after the Polish uprising, not until the Polish uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">I, occasionally, was a few times in <span class="DLF">sewers</span> for a very short, brief times, but my whole days spending in the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> was after...in the Polish uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">That's...uh...a chapter by itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">The <span class="DLF">sewers</span> ...the height of the sewer pipe is not more than...uh...probably 3 feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">That's the major pipes and...uh...the bottom of the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> is mostly with the mud and...uh...what's came out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">All this is good when the water is running, but when water is not running, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was cut off of water, Warsick...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> after...during the uprising, you just not go...was walking on water, which is...uh...but you were walking only on the mud, the dirt, the human...uh...I would say that today, people would say that...uh...gee, to go through such a few hours, I'd rather die. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">I don't want to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">But...uh...when you are forced to do it, you're doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">And...uh...we...it is an experience, but I think this would be good to come back to this if we would discuss the question of the Polish uprising which I was involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="998">QUESTION: Let's talk a little bit then about the period between the ghetto uprising of 1943 and the Polish uprising of '44.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">ANSWER: Uh...That was for me, personally, a period between 1943 and 1944, it's almost a year...uh...or a little bit less than a year, but in these few months, they were so...I was so much involved in the work and living as a Christian that probably...that's probably account for most of my memories of the...of the...of my living in the Nazi era. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">First, those years...the...1 was able to walk around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> because I did not have the Jewish look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">They said I had a good look because I looked like a Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Blue eyes, blond, and...uh...well dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">Dressed like...uh...a tough guy, with high boots, and I had to parade in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And I must say that although I was brought up in so much believing in humanity, so much believed that mankind is good, that...uh...goodness is...1s only...is in mankind by itself, it's only the bad thing is being manipulated by government, by regimes, and the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , I was...I realized that governments and regimes are one thing, but mankind by itself is a problem...is a problematic thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">I developed a terrible fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">Probably everybody in my <span class="NPIP">place</span> was constantly under fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">I was afraid for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I also developed a sense of recognizing dangers faster than anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">My antennas were tune...tuned much more...uh...delicately, to delicate...uh...more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">But what was...what I remember from those days...that practically every human being which had the human feature walking on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> freely was mine enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Possible I passed through the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I passed through people which were righteous people and maybe they had in their own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> hiding Jews or doing other good deeds, but to me when they had the human features, he became...he...he was a part of the human race. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">He was my enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And...uh...I1 was looking always to be around animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And I spent in my free time...a lot of my time in the <span class="BUILDING">zoo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">Cause everything which...uh... was human was...uh...first of all, 1t was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to spend time because I did not have what to do with my time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And...uh...anything I did...the animals I wasn't afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">It could have been even a tiger, I was not afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">But I was afraid by the unknown of the human people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">And everybody who legs, hands, eyes and walked like a human being was my enemy, or my potential enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">In...only my thoughts and my fear....1 was probably wrong on passing by a lot of people, but that's how I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">So I walked around and I was very safe among the cows, the...the...goals, and ...uh...and...uh...and also among the ..uh...horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">But talking about animals, I want to go back to the...to the story of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Where I had to...you know, as I told you, uh...my parents had the hiding, the...the <span class="DLF">wall</span> which was made in the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> of the two goats on the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , and when there was a funeral and they had to hid themselves they had to use to go into that <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> and sit in that <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Uh...The two goats, which were in that <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , were very abrasive to my parents, never to the owner and never to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">But they always knew that they are weaker, that they can push them and...uh...when my mother passed by and my father, the goats used to really violently push them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">And they felt they knew that my mother or my sister or my father will not do anything to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">At the same time, if I walked in or the owner walked in, the goats were very, you know, watching us and listening what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">I also know that about...uh...rcemember a lady, Mrs. Shefner, used to tell me she used to be in hiding in a...in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there were chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">And even the chickens after awhile recognized that she's a weak person, and even this chickens pushed that woman, Mrs. Shefner, which came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> later, and survived here...survived the war also through a miracle, and...uh....she used to tell me about the chickens taking advantage on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">So it's a very...uh...complicated thing to look back as this... something is in the...1n the human race or in the nature where a living animal recognizes the weakness, but for the human race to...to be without any feelings that the other person is the same...that I walked around the <span class="DLF">street</span> and was afraid for every human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">That was a tremendous blow to all mine revolutionary ideas of...uh...ideas of mankind, of goodness, of only...only the problem of...uh...of uh...of what is bad in humanity is the manipulation of the regime took a tremendous blow.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1033">ANSWER: (Sigh) The Warsaw uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">Until the Warsaw uprising, it was period of 1 year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">We were living...in the Polish uprising, we were living...uh...before the uprising, as I said, Viadka was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and my parents and myself which I used to come then the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Praga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Praga</span> was liberated probably 3 days when the uprising days started, 2 days or 3 days after the uprising started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">Uh...I remember that we were informed by the underground that we should await an uprising because the Russian Army was closing in on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">This was September. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Uh...September...August, September 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">So we...my parents...the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> were situated in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> between two <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1041"><span class="DLF">Street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Praga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">That's where the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">So there was a talk that the Germans before are leaving this...this...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> will blow up all the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and all the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And I came back to my parents and I told them this is the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">Listen, they have two choices. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">Either you can remain here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">I will go to which of my prayer father...mother asked, "Where are you going to be."

During the days of the uprising, across the <span class="DLF">street</span> where we were, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Achina</span> , was a bombed out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...<span class="BUILDING">building</span> , uh...which was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of...uh...<span class="BUILDING">pharmaceutical factory</span> , very well known, _._In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they called it . </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">This is more or less a comparitant, like the aspirin in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And I got...uh...uh...acquainted with that caretaker from that bombed out <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and I agreed with him that we will start preparing in case the...the uprising comes to an end and it looked that we are going to lose because the Germans...the Russians did not move at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">They stood on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> without any fight against the Germans...uh... They would not move. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">We know today that this were also connected with political reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">They did not want to give the Poles the opportunity to say that they liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">And they let them just...uh...die out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And I built that <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> which was...uh...the bombed out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">I found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to crawl into that <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and there was one place...a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where they had that...uh...uh...roof...uh...uh...not a <span class="DLF">roof</span> , the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> built round ceiling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">They calledit_—_—s the Klein way of <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">That was holding, and I found a tremendous large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">But the only thing is the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was empty because usually all the...uh.. rubbish, rubble was brought in to the <span class="DLF">holes</span> , but this was about the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and I decided to build that <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and for the 2 months during the uprising I kept building that <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and supplying that <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> with batteries with car batteries water and food and whatever I could have, and I decided to stay in that <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">But when I took Vladka one day when the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> was completed, and I said, "Here, we're going to walk in and we're going to be...uh...waiting until the Russians will come." </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">She refused to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">She said I am not going to be cooped up this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">I...She really did not have...what could have happened the worst to her was is if she would have to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> maybe she will be taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but...uh...not...uh...

</span><span class="sentence" id="1167">Well, we were liberated in January 16, and the January 17, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and the first thing what I went...I went to the place of that <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and I saw the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was untouched. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">That means the people are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And I started to dig. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">I did not know that they were there and alive, all of them. </span><span class="sentence"

one of the moments of an individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">Uh...Then I and Vladka left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> with another couple...uh...together ....uh...the boy was a Christian boy and the girl was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">And the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> has to be evacuated and we were brought to one <span class="NPIP">point</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">For a few days...uh....before we decided to leave, I decided to get dressed as a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">And I walked around 3 days dressed as a woman and everybody encouraged...was encouraging me that I looked good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">Uh...The reason why I wanted to look like a woman I didn't want to be separated because with Vladka, I felt safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Parents I did not have anymore any contact with them and I walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I walked around with high heels, white shoes, and with a...with a makeup on my face, but I looked terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">Vladka used to tell me, "You look like a terrible prostitute." </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">The last day before I decided to walk out, I decided no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">I took off all the clothes of the woman of the clothes and I put back my...my men's dress suit or whatever I had, the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">I says, "Whatever will happen will happen." </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">The only thing which happened, I had a little bit kinked hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">And that was a weak point because...uh... usually Jewish people had kinked hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">And I did not have the possibilities in all this time to press them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">So we decided that I am going to put a big bandage on my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And I was walking around with a bandage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">Uh...the bandage became so dirty that some people said, "Why don't you go in to see a doctor because you're going to get an infection from the dirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">How can you have a wounded head with such a dirty bandage?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">So we can walked out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , somehow the German did not stopped us, but the Germans prepared...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , and the entire population to take those who are wounded to...because they couldn't walk the 20 miles to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow</span> to where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were to take us to...because others to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">One of the Poles saw me walking...me and Vladka, and he saw me wounded...uh...and motioned with his hand come and we jumped on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and he covered us immediately with a sheet and somehow...uh...Vladka he gave a Red Cross...uh...arm band and we were... never knew who that Pole is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">He never knew who I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">He did not think that Hitler was thinking that he's saving a Polish patriot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">And...uh...this way we escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">When the whole column of the...of the...of the horse...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> moved, when we came in between the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> someplace, we run out of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and we run and we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow</span> to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and there where I was able to remain for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">I rented a...uh...a small...a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , with a Polish woman and husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">I don't think that she...that they were from the high class society. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">She was.. baby was...was not...she was not such a delicate person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">But whether I do, the Germans every night used to go around and look for the party...for the people who escaped to find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">So I convinced them one day that, listen, it's going to be very bad if they're going to find us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">They're going to...not us Jews, they're going to take her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span

destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">I felt....[ did not see Juliana Lariage because she left with another group someplace to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">But I felt that this is place I can open the <span class="DLF">door</span> and say that am I staying here because I knew where itis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">This was ss 44, or 42 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">And we opened the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there, and this became the first nuptials of the first Jews coming back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">And my mother immediately the first day...my father went out and he bought a sack of potatoes and there was a big kettle where they used to boil laundry and my mother used to peel the potatoes all day and cook and everybody who walked in just got the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">The potato soup, a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to warm up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">And I remember there the first week the people were sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">We did not have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">Some maybe a hundred or more people, whoever came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">Later on, the next <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , the Jewish committee was created. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">Maybe...I don't know if I was coincidental or not, but the next <span class="BUILDING">building Targowa 40</span> , the Jewish Committee was created. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">And...uh...my father, I don't know, immediately went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> ...uh...which was liberated before and I was not with him, but I recall that he told me how he met his brother, his youngest brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">He met with him on the <span class="DLF">street</span> 1n...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">They just came across each other on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">They embraced, but for an hour they cried together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">None of them asked who’s alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">My uncle later told me that...uh...the story how he met with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">That he says, "Don't you ask me who’s alive?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">He says, "Why should I ask you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">I think everybody is dead." </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">So he told him, "My wife is alive." </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">And he told him, "My wife is alive." </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">They were even afraid to tell if somebody is alive and ask about anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">Naturally, in 2 or 3 days later, my father came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and...uh...1mmediately got...engaged himself in the public work and then making a living, buying, selling, whatever he did and that's... A week later my uncle came to me and says, "Listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">I want you to do me a favor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">You are with Vladka. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">We know everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">But father insists on the Huppah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">And I spoke with Vladka, and she said, "Why not?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">I think that was 10 days after liberation or 8 days in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we were hiding, we had a million of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">I think it was the first Huppah in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">I am trying to tell you things of personal interest, but at the same time I am avoiding to tell you things of our involvement in the types of happenings of others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">I spent a life with Vladka together in...as a Christian boy....involved, endangering life, never thinking that we are endangering in work with others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">There were many people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">The majority of the people in the underground which did the work what we were doing is sometimes maybe much more heroic of what I have to tell you, did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">They perished, not only by being Jews, but by helping others to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">I don't know if history will do justice, that those couriers, those young fighters will be remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">People usually talk of those who survived, but our survival was not built because we were smarter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">Our survival was not built that we were more capable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">Everything what happened to us was just coincidental. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">It was sheer luck, sometimes more than your own intuition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">It was sheer luck of situations we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">But I would like to leave a legacy is to leave a legacy of those who did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">They are always forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">There are many people alive today which survived because others cared for them, and mainly the others were the Jewish boys and Jewish girls...the majority of them did not make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">And I hope...we don't even have the pictures of all of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">We did not even have the records. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">We don't have the records of even...I know thatinthe ——_ and Dick and Sylvia and others, were trying to put together the names of those who were involved, of those who fight...fought, of those who did not think about the dangers they are gotten involved, but even this is not completed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">We don't remember all the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">So the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> which is being built, I hope will, through some way, find a way of remembering the...those...the unknown names, the unknown members of the underground, the unknown young people who paid the...with their lives to help others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1476">QUESTION: Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">Let's go back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">This was very important and very, very significant, moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">Let's go back a little bit and touch on a couple of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">Ben, the one thing you didn't give us at all is what life was like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> when you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> way back when.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1481">ANSWER:  Michael, you are with me 10 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">In the 10 years, I told you many stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">I was trying through you to bring back and you knew...you heard a lot, but it's impossible to speak about everything and much more difficult is to describe everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">There are scenes which are in my mind which I am not able to describe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">I am too poor with my language to be able to do it, but I was trying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">You ask me about the life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1487">QUESTION: In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1488">ANSWER:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> is only a symbol. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">There were other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and there people were sacrificing lives in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">There were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">But the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> will be remembered for many reasons because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> represents like the symbols for others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , I think, today life, especially Jewish life, is very organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">I wish it could have been organized like this the years when we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">The war would be different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">Jewish life was organized to such an extent that every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had their own committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">And we cared for each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">We had no means, but we shared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">We were living under constant terror and more...more important, we were living under constant feeling of hunger and helplessness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">We were living in a world abandoned by the entire world, by neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">We could have looked into the <span class="DLF">windows</span> of our neighbors through the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and our neighbors could have looked into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">But...uh...there was very little reaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">What was the aim of the creation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">Today, I start to understand this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">I did not understand this in those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">The other was the concentration, a gathering of...ingathering of the victims under the conditions of making them...uh...1mpossible to live, deprived of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">Everything what we did in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">Eating bread, which was rationed, was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">Beside breathing, if you could, everything was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510"><span class="BUILDING">Schools</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">Children lost their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> hungry without any <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> , dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">We were suffering of that dirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">Everything was lice were crawling about people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">You could have seen not...not with the naked eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">You could have seen more lice on the people than you could have seen the clawing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">All this was in preparation to give us a slow death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">But this was not enough...not at first enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">But in spike of everything, we behaved more humane than anybody could have even thought about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">We had culture events by the hundreds and thousands in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">Each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had a culture director, not director, a culture person in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">When we had to stay indoors, we had every night prepared a different lecture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">Some of them from well prepared speakers, but most of them by young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">So this was not a life, you know, of allowing to ourself just to disintegrate or to be brought down to the...to the way the Germans wanted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">But it was done with calculation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">Today we know the way we were treated in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , people were treated not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there was a pattern. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">Nothing was done in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> by just by the will of the commander which came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">He came with a text book and with instructions how to create <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Judenrat</span> , how to create <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , how to create the rationing, how to create the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">Everything was well __. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">So when we speak about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , we should also remember the way the people, not only militarily opposed them, which is important, but the spiritual resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">In my <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was the Rabbi, a very, very lone Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">He was in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">And I was given the responsibility, because I was the secretary of the house committee to make sure that nobody knows that he lives there, but to make sure that food is being delivered to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">But he has his disciplines, even with those terrible situations, I cannot forget they used to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">And from their portions of bread to bring the bread for the Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">That the Rabbi should be not hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">The devotion to the Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">He perished later in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">Now...uh...from the point of view of getting information.</span></p>
