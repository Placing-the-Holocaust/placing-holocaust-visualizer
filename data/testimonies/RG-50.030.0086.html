<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Doris, would you tell me about your family and your childhood before the Nazis -- your parents, your grandparents? </span><span class="sentence" id="6">What was life like for a little girl?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  For me, I thought it was <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And we had a large family. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My grandparents have -- had six children: three boys and three girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My mother was the oldest of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So, I had five uncles and aunts, and some of them were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And since my mother was the oldest, I was treated like the baby, very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">The, the first, the second grandchild in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And, and life was for me marvelous. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Summers we spent in a place outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">It was called the Line of Otvosk train. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">On that <span class="DLF">line</span> were a few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and sometimes my parents would rent a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or another and we would spend summers there so that my parents could come out for the Sabbath for the weekend and stay with us, with my sister and I. And, of course, I just recently started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and everything was new and everything was rosy. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I didn't know there was a worry in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Loved <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , then went to, to learn how to dance and rhythm in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maccabee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Enjoyed life. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Wintertime, skating; summertime, bicycle riding -- and that's how I remember <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">The holidays were spent in my grandparents' <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with all the children around and, and favorite dishes and favorite cups and very traditional, very traditional, and it was just great. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">It was just great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  Lovely. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">What happened when the war broke out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  Well, when the war broke out -- this was almost the beginning of a school year when the war broke out, and there was approximately three weeks of bombardment before the Germans entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and from the rubble I got injured but didn't feel bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I was with my family and I didn't understand what was happening until, until I heard that Jewish males are, are running away towards the <span class="DLF">eastern border</span> and two of my uncles and my father got ready to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">My father then changed his mind and he stayed to take care of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">They were going to leave, going towards the east, away from the Germans ' The interviewee notes that this name is spelled “Fox” by her relatives living in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">and that's when it dawned on me that something is wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">But the Germans came in and immediate- immediately did not happen anything, like the same week, did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But in a very short time, things started happening -- for the whole population and not only for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">It was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Orders came out almost daily: “You mustn't do this, you mustn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">You have to give up your radios, your gold, your things. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">You're not allowed to go here or there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Everyday something new, for the whole population, and it began being really bad for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">They were singled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We had to wear armbands, white armbands with a blue Star of David to identify ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="40"><span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> had to be identified. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">People who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> used to use their Jewish name in a, in a Polish version, and this was forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">You had to show your real Jewish name for easy identification and, therefore, persecution, beatings, and, and sending -- being sent out to, “To work,” so they said, and just beatings. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And then Jews were not allowed to walk on the on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> , only in the middle of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It became worse and worse daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  How did it affect you as a little girl?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  I was...I was all right as long as I was with my family because during this time my parents got in touch with a former teacher and they -- the teacher organized a little class of children to come to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and study in exchange for almost anything like some food or clothing for his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Of course, it was forbidden, and I enjoyed going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We started off with 10 children, and little by little, the group got smaller as the children died from hunger or were caught and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I never knew what happened, just that they didn't show. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">But this happened: One day when I was on my way to, to the teacher, Professor Rozycki -- oh, we used to come separately so that the Germans or nobody would see that we're forming a group, so each one came within a few minutes of each other, and one day I was on my way and a few blocks away somebody stopped me and said, “Are you going to Professor Rozycki?” </span><span class="sentence" id="51">and I didn't answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And they said, “Don't go there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So I didn't go there, and I waited and it became clear that that very morning the Germans came, raided his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , killed all the males in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Even his father-in- law, who was in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchair</span> , was thrown out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I don't remember how I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but I think that this was the, the time when my life, when I started realizing as a young girl what -- that something is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I looked around and people were on the <span class="DLF">street</span> covered with papers, bodies, near bodies, were crying for bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I was always fed, so I don't remember crying for food, although hunger was a constant companion. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">But the, the view of the bodies covered with paper, the swollen bodies, was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I had more time to look around and see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">When I was busy in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I was busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We had classes the whole day and then homework, and it kept us busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But then when this was gone, I could see -- look around me, and I could see everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I lost my friends to hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I, I saw people -- bodies -- being taken away in a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hand carriage</span> , and there was nothing that I could do for anybody, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">There was a former teacher, Pani? </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Kaminska, who was our music teacher in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and she tried to form a, a choir under those circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It was unbelievable how our people tried to keep up the spirit, and how people know that when you're learning, when you're “doing,” you can, you can withstand hardship. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">May be easier or may be, may be harder, but it enables you to continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">You don't get necessarily wrapped up in yourself, in your hunger, in you- your being cold, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And we tried very hard, but it became impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It became impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Very soon thereafter we got orders to move: all Jews have to move into certain <span class="DLF">streets</span> or rather remove themselves from certain <span class="DLF">streets</span> in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and there were some <span class="DLF">streets</span> that were we were allowed to move to and we had to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">We were allowed to -- my parents had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , so in order to move fast like we were ordered many -- much of our belongings were put in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and little by little we would carry to the new so-called <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And one day before we knew it, we woke up and the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were closed, everybody trapped. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And I didn't realize it then but I did realize that there were so many people walking in. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Now I know that it was because we were squeezed into a smaller <span class="REGION">area</span> and also there were people brought in from other <span class="NPIP">places</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , and therefore there were so many people and so many hungry and dead and cold people and there was nothing that anybody can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Now the Germans daily would go out and catch people in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , take them to what they called the <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> °, put them in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and send them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">As a matter of fact, at the beginning, one of my aunts who had a husband and a son a year older than I was when they saw the advertising that the, the Germans put out that anybody who comes on his own to that <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> will be treated well and sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for the duration of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">My aunt packed for them their belongings and -- like bags -- and she got them there without knowing where they were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Never saw them again and after a while we started hearing that that those people are not being sent to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And you know, nobody wanted to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">People were...started jumping off <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> if they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Whether they get shot or not, they tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And more and more we started hearing that that people are being brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and never heard from afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">To me, it was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Nobody told me anything, but I could hear the adults talking among themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So it became worse and worse and then after they caught everybody in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , they started clearing out <span class="BUILDING">building</span> by <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They made unannounced visits and called everybody to come down and be marched away. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">They also organized some <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I remember I -- I was in one. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I always looked older than I was and somehow my aunt, my aunt, my uncle, they took me along and I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">This was after they took my parents away. * </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Mrs. (Polish). </span><span class="sentence" id="94">> The <span class="DLF">deportation area</span> that separated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from surrounding <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> (German).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Back up a little bit and tell us what happened to your parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  Well, my parents...my parents perished separately. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They -- when the Germans organized <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , everybody had to register and go to work, which they did, but then one day they marched off everybody from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and that's how my father got caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He went to work, never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">The whole group was marched to <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> and sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My mom, she went out one morning to see if she could exchange some clothes for some food for the family and she got caught on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and sent to <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Never saw her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Now, my older sister -- we, we then had to move again twice after, after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And at that time, my older sister and I, we went with, with my grandmother, my aunt, and my aunt's little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">We were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muranowska</span> , and one day when the Germans came in to look for us, we had, we had <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We had -- well, I have to go back and describe the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">In this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , like in many <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , the <span class="DLF">outside walls</span> are very thick and there was no refrigeration at that time, so usually underneath a <span class="DLF">window</span> there would be a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> that served as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were made of stone and therefore keeping things cool and the <span class="DLF">walls</span> are very wide. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We were, we were in such a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and at the time my grandmother, my aunt and her little boy would sit right underneath in the, in the little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> underneath the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and I put a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> in front of it so nobody notices there is a <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Then there was a folding <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> that folded up to look like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> inside and my sister went <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , and I folded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I threw something over it so that she cannot be noticed. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I went -- I was supposed to go upstairs to the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and hide in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , but by the time all that was done there was no time to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , so I went to the little <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> which had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shelf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Where I sit now across was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shelf</span> , up high, and on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> that they had a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> standing there for whatever reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I jumped on top of the shelf in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and there was the bulb, the light. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I quietly unscrewed the bulb and I made sure that my clothes don't show down and I sat there quietly. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Well, the Germans came in and they found my sister....So that's how I lost my parents and my sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  What did you do when the Germans left? </span><span class="sentence" id="116">They had taken your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We, we heard some shots and, and, see, my aunt and my grandmother could see through a little ventilator that was in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , but they didn't tell me anything, but I heard from neighbors that they have shot my sister, but I don't know for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Over the years I've been trying to find her. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">You know, just, just the possibility...right? </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Nobody told me for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So that's how I lost them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  What happened after that incident? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Where did you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="125">What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Well, I had, I had, I have an uncle who was married and -- to a Polish lady, and she was with him in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They lost a son to, to illness and my other uncle together with his brother decided -- and my aunt -- they decided that something has to be done and we have to leave, so they went out and they found an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> somewhere, very inexpensive with one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and, first, her husband, my aunt's husband, my uncle, came out to live in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Excuse me -- you're saying they found an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  Outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  How -- can you explain how did they find it? </span><span class="sentence" id="131">They were not allowed to go out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Well, they smuggled themselves out with a group of people that was going to work, to labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">There were <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> -- there were places where, outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , where Jews were marched to every morning and brought back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> every night, and they worked there, and you could apparently -- I wouldn't know how, but apparently you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I heard that you could sometimes find either a nice or a greedy soldier who was watching and for some money would let somebody out. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I haven't witnessed it that but just heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I know that my uncle would go out with a group of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They were going to, to a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that used to belong to a family person like a cousin or of, of the family's who had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of, of electric chandeliers, and the Germans took it over, and I think that they kept him as a manager or something, or as a foreman, and groups were coming in to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They probably switched their chandeliers. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">They didn't do chandeliers, only did other things in there, but it was still something. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So the groups were coming 1n and out and he could go out, smuggle himself out and then two brothers and one brother's wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">My uncle Janek with his wife Zosia; my uncle Mietek, who was single, and my Aunt Zosia had brothers there who apparently helped them find an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and it was all in Aunt Zosia's name. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">That's why it was a small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and they made a double wall over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">In the little <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> they made a double wall and that's where later on my grandmother went out this way into that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">My uncle came to pick them up, and then my aunt went, and...with a baby, little Jakov, who was born in May of '39 just before the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And little by little, whoever was left -- my grandmother, my aunt, my other aunt, two uncles, and I was left and my Aunt Tecia, the one who sent her husband and son on the on the trip, well, she was a nurse and a very good nurse, and my uncle came to take her out, and she refused to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Apparently, she knew there were rumors, must have been rumors about the, the revol- the revolt, and as a nurse she wanted to be there and besides by that time she realized that her husband and son are dead, so she did not want to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Anyway, it was decided that I go out, so my uncle took me out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Can you describe to me what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was like at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Oh, when, when I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , there were still some <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> there staying, standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">The, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was, was -- there was very few people -- not, not more people. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Most people were either in the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> or gone from the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , and on the <span class="DLF">street</span> you didn't see anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">You couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">When, when I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> a year later to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , that's when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> looked terrible, all burned out. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But when I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> it was still standing and the revolt started and after it was finished, I took a -- when I was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> I was able to, to ride in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> , tramway around the <span class="DLF">walls</span> and I saw it burning, and I saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> coming and bombing it, and I saw it all burning, and I couldn't even shed a tear. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">You become so strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I never thought about it, but you become so strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">The, the survival — the urge to survive becomes number one priority, and I just looked at it and my thought was that I mustn't cry because other people will see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Unreal, but true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Let us go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Now you're still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  Tell us about when you were smuggled out and describe it, please.</span></p>

QUESTION:  What year and months are we in, about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Ok, the approximate time I can know, because my birthday was in March and I remember when my uncle told me the story how it was decided that I come out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">It seems my uncle spoke to his wife, Zosia, and he told her that it's my birthday and I'm a young child and so on, and an invitation was issued for me to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So my other uncle, his brother, Uncle Mietek, he came back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he is the one who took me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We went with a group of workers, night shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And we marched, marched together and we were marched through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> to that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> on....I think 1t was on <span class="DLF">Grzybowska Street</span> ...that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that belonged to, to this relative of ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I even remembered his name but I can't recall it on the spot -- Gruszkiewicz, Gruszkiewicz. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Well, we -- finally, the whole group went in into the big <span class="DLF">door</span> or <span class="DLF">gate</span> and in front 1t was empty only you had to go through a -- well, it is like, like the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is all around and, and is...in the center is empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So they had to go to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the workers walked through this <span class="DLF">gate</span> into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">My uncle and I went into the <span class="DLF">staircase</span> on the side of the front which was empty, and I remember we sat there quietly the whole night. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">It was sometime in March. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">It was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We sat there the whole night because of the curfew and in the morning we carefully, very carefully made our way to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of my aunt and uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We were stopped on the way by somebody who wanted money who felt he recognized us. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">My uncle took care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">| was just numb. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I was just numb. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">But we finally reached the, the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> there and I saw my grandmother and my aunt and at that time my little cousin was not there anymore because they found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for him with a Polish woman whom, whom -- who was paid, and she was also very, very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">She took care of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">He was like three years old, three and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And it was quite, quite a risk to take a little boy of three and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And she took the risk so she, she took care of the little boy in her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">She only lived in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Everything together -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and was, was a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And she took care of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And she was not rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">She was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So when I got to that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , I saw my uncle, my two aunts, my grandmother, and I must say that that I felt kind of safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Little did I know that...that we weren't safe at all, but that's how I felt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  How did you live in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for the next two weeks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  Oh, we didn't, we didn't stay there too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">As I said I felt safe but it was not very safe because in a very little time, soon after we got there, after the curfew there was a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and some agents came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">They spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">They must have been German agents that knew Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">You know, there were some people there they call themselves Volksdeutche,* but they, they spoke Polish very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I don't know who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">They were civilians, but I remember they wore boots, high boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">They came in and they looked and they found a little <span class="DLF">trap door</span> and they got us all out. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">So, it wasn't that safe as I thought.</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="370">It doesn't — it, it made no difference whether they were, what their religion was, their nationality, I find good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Maybe I'm lucky but that's what I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Like the documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And I felt that at one point that religion is religion, and we play pray to God and at the same time it's also safe to go Sunday to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and I thought to myself that I'm gonna to pray to God. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I don't have to name God. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Whatever it 1s, I'm gonna to pray, and I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">This was -- the only thing I had were <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and I prayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I didn't know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I picked up a book and I read and I did what other people did, and pretty soon I was pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And this priest I mentioned before in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , as I said, I used to go Sunday to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and then in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you stop and talk and he talked to me, and I was not very convincing. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I didn't try to be convincing. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I was talking to a priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I was more open than, than with anybody on the <span class="DLF">street</span> except I didn't give myself away willingly. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I didn't state who I was, but he figured out and he also put some nuts in my pocket for Sunday, and candy. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">But he told me that I could get a better job or whatever and I didn't pay attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I needed that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">But one day I got really sick, very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I broke out in, 1n skin rashes and that's because I was taking care of a pig and of a goat, billy goat, and cleaning out all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I only owned one flannel yellow shirt which at daytime I put a piece of string around, was a dress, and at night it was a nightgown. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And once when I wanted to wash it, I froze. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I didn't have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and, on this side of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">The other side of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> was the <span class="DLF">pig sty</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And from this I got all kinds of rashes. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I didn't go to the doctor of course, but I told the priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I think that gave me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">He said, “Did you grow up on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And I said [nodding head “yes’’]. “</span><span class="sentence" id="399">Well,” he says, “you belong -- you, you don't belong on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And, and he told me to go to the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> and buy calamine lotion or whatever it was, and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And this is the same priest who one day sent word that I ought to go to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And I knew that he, he knows that somebody must have said something or suspect and if there was a suspicion they would come and check it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">So I walked to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , stayed at <span class="BUILDING">Ola's</span> for the night and everything went ok, but I couldn't stay there much longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Also my friend Pepi was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zoliborz</span> , and -- where I went to visit with her, she told me there is an opening for an assistant cook, but there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to, to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">She had a <span

with me, and I did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I went to, to her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zoliborz</span> and helped her in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> of a

class="sentence" id="411">It happened to be my day off, and I went to my aunt and she was at that time on the other side of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Vistula</span> . </span><span

QUESTION:  Went for what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">ANSWER:  He, a friend of my parents' who was working as a tram driver, conductor on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I met him on the <span class="DLF">street</span> one day and he wanted to help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And I told him that I need a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for my aunt to stay, and some documents, and he arranged it. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">His name I never forget because I was looking for him for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I wanted to thank him. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I don't know if he's alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Stefan Mningoc, Stefan Mningoc. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I get goose bumps when I think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">He had a sister who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Praga</span> with a husband and some children, I don't remember how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And the husband declared himself Volksdeutche. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Means that he gets all the privileges, and of course with the privileges becomes the possibility to hire a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Now this Stefan went to his sister after he arranged for my aunt a document saying that she's Natalia, forgot the last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I'll remember it probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Natalia, he arranged for her the documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">He went to his sister and he told her a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">He told her that Natalia is a widow of a fellow officer in the Polish army and she willing to be the governess for the children and whatever because she is now a widow. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">He told his own sister that and he knew that people were, were, were killed if they tried to help Jews and yet he did that for my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">He told me it was for my parents and for my sister that he's doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And she wo- she worked there as a maid and on that day when, when the Polish revolt started. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I had a day off, and I went to visit her across, walked across the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and she had given me a sweater which she knitted for her son, little Jakov -- little Jacek -- and she- and IJ -- said “Yes, I'm going there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="439">She says, “Would you take it to my son?” </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And I took the sweater and I visited with her first and I took the sweater, and I went back to the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to visit Ola with my little cousin and brought the sweater. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And then I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zoliborz</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> where I was, and as I came back the shots started. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And the, the Polish revolt started. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">It was '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I think October 1, if I'm not mistaken. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I hadn't seen them until after the war because --

ANSWER:  My aunt or my cousin, her son. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">You wanted to know how about my grandmother, I think you asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I did say -- I did tell you that she committed suicide when she found out that my Uncle Miatek was killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  I'd like to go back now. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">You're talking about the beginning of the Polish revolt in 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Can you tell me what that day was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  Well, I can tell you what it was for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  It was a day that I had the time off and I went to visit my aunt and my cousin and came back in quite a good mood because I saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">They were safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">They were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I gave them, each one of them, regards so I was kind of a contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">They were not seeing each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So the mood was elated and I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zoliborz</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and I told Pepi all about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Of course, we had to communicate very discreetly because the owners of the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> couldn't find out that we know each other from before or who we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So the -- that day was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">When the shots started, I didn't know what it was all about but this Stefan who arranged for my aunt to stay with his sister, he came in that day to the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , and he said that there 1s a revolt going and he's 1n it and he won't see me for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I never saw him since. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Never again. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And the first day was, was pretty good for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">But then of course the shooting started. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I have to explain that when you are with other people and they are shooting <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> with the Krajowa® from across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , you're scared, but you feel that you're in the same co-- position with all other people and that there is a war going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">One never suggests that that when there is a political war that somebody wants to hurt civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">But, sure, civilians do get hurt, so it was not bad -- especially when we heard after a while that the Russians are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Praga</span> , across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and we thought any minute they'll come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Somebody will come in to stop the shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Somebody would free so that we don't have the shooting and, and nobody dies. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Well, it didn't happen that way because the Russians stopped there. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">They didn't cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">The, the revolt took two months and then we were all captured and led through the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow</span> , and at the time the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was very, very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">We could smell the smoldering the, the, the fires but they were almost burned out. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Mainly, we saw skeletons of <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">We walked in the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> because there was a lot of debris and we were walked to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and at that time from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">We went in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> , but locked not closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">They were halfway open. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Nobody thought of jumping or, or running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Pepi and I, we looked at each other: “Are we going or are we not?” </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I -- she said, “Let's wait a while and see what happens.” </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Little did I know that she had, she had poison that she carried with her and she kept it for the last minute, if necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I found that out when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruek</span> and we stayed in <span class="DLF">line</span> to go into the <span class="BUILDING">bath house</span> and she asked me while we ® Armia Krajowa [Home Army] (Polish). </span><span class="sentence" id="485">were staying in <span class="DLF">line</span> if, if I think that, is it time or not yet? </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And I said, “Oh, let's wait and see,’ and by the time we got in and we were ordered to strip and give everything away, she didn't have it anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">QUESTION:  Could you tell me about the arrival in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruek</span> , please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">QUESTION:  And could you repeat the word “Ravensbruek” so it’s on the tape?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  Yeah, well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow</span> we were put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and these were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> , all closed, locked with tiny little <span class="DLF">window</span> and we were taken -- I don't know if it was 10 days, two weeks, 12 days -- it was day after day after day and night after night. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">We were taken and we stopped on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , on side <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Many times there was an air attack and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">We had reached one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> near, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I forgot the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="495">that rumors were we were going to stay there and then we didn't stay there and again with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> until we reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruek</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Of course, the conditions were terrible, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Hardly anything, but we made it, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruek</span> we stayed in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">We were political prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">We were not Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">We were political prisoners and we were standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> registering our names and given out numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">We were asked age and, of course, they looked us over and I said that I was 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I was lying about my name so I was also lying about my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I wanted to be with Pepi. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Pepi I think was in her 30s. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">So I got a number and there was a red triangle made of cloth with the letter “P” on it for political prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">The red was for political prisoner and on a white cloth was my number, 74073. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And she was 704 -- 4074. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I don't remember whether it was, she was first or I was first. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I think I was first, and we got consecutive numbers and from then on we had no names, just numbers, and then we went to the <span class="BUILDING">bath house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">We -- as I said they took away our clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">We had to strip. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Everybody was shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I don't know by what miracle Pepi and I were not shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Until today I have no answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Somebody told me that the majority of people had lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I don't believe it because this is not why you were shaved but they did not shave her. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">They did not shave me. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">They left my long hair and when we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> , we really expected to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">We really did, and we said, “Well, we could have taken the poison but it's gone and it probably won't take longer with being gassed.” </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Well, we were very surprised when water came. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And we, we really got a shower. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">There was even this gray soap that looked like pumice stone but a little softer. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">But 1t was not gas, so we took the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and we went out on the other end of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and we were given the striped uniforms and then I understood why we wanted to take the poison before we went in because each group that went in ahead of us, we never saw them coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">We didn't recognize them. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">They were shaved and wearing stripes. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">So then when we got stripes and were getting sizes that are impossible, a big person would get a tiny dress, a tiny, tiny person would get a big dress, but we came out alive and we had our numbers and a triangle and we were assigned to <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">When we came into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , we saw on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> Jewish writing, names, messages, many of it in Yiddish which I couldn't read, but Pepi could and she told me they were names. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">She read them to me and I, I could understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I just couldn't read or write, and she told me there were messages, very, very heartbreaking messages and names of the people: “We...we were here. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">We’re the last. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Tell others to remember us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It, it was very sad, but we were ushered to those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and we were not killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">We, we had these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattresses</span> , three in a row high and we stayed there until they sent us to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  Ravens- how long were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruek</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">ANSWER:  Well, I have to figure 1t out. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruek</span> at the last day of the Polish revolt which was October, November, and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruek</span> we must have been, December, December, January, and then we were, we were sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forest Wildbou</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brandenburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">QUESTION:  Let's stay in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">You were there for more than a few days, which is the only thing --
ANSWER:  Yes, but a short time and then I was staying longer in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , in the in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little more about what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruek</span> was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruek</span> was a very huge <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and there were inmates from many, many nations. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">In the short stay I could notice truck-fulls of bodies -- how skinny, just bones and skin, bodies, dead bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">They had, they had a place where they hung people. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I did not witness any, any hangings but they, they had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I could see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> going back and forth with bodies here and bodies there. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">We did not do much over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">We were then transported to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And that was in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and it was a smaller camp, and we were building this <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> for, for a narrow or a short distance <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">It was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">We were marched every morning, after what we call Apell’ time. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">We were marched to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Were putting the, the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> and the ties and while we were doing that, while we were marching, we were guarded by SS people, men and women with dogs and when we got there they would, we would make a fire so they could stay and keep warm while we were working and worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Towards the evenings, we were coming back and we would get watery soup, or water, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">In that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was really bad. ? </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Roll call (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="554">The, the, the SS men and the SS women, they were beating everybody they could see and the, the terrain was wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">They would put people face down and, and just stomp on them and beat them. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I saw once thing like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">After this railroad thing, one day I was transferred to another barr- to a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where they had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and they told me they are parts for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> , but all I saw was little screws or little small items that you had to punch holes in and they told us how to do it, so I immediately asked if my mother could come, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">It was really not safe to do that, but I did and they said, “Yes,” so Pepi and I were brought, worked in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and she was working there testing. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">You have to test if they are good or bad, and most of them were bad, really, but we had to, we had to produce something because the foreman tried to be nice to, to us, not to beat us or anything, and we all tried to back him up and he had some quota to fulfill. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">If there is so and so much bad output, then he would be punished, so I remember Pepi was telling me that she was checking and she was saying, “Make good ones, make bad ones, whatever.” </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And we worked there 12 hours a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  You said you had convinced the guards to let you bring your mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">You were pretending --
ANSWER:  Not the guards, the, the, the managers of it, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  You pretended that Pepi was your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">It so happened that during all this time that I met Pepi, she tried to protect me and I tried to protect her. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">She lost her own child and apparently she felt she wanted to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">She, she was an outstanding person. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">To describe her, I probably couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">That's how good she was, and for everybody to everybody -- to humanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">On my side, she, she had dark hair, brown eyes, and she looked Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I don't know what it means to look Jewish but that's what the stereotype is, look Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">On the other hand, I didn't very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And I felt that in this respect if I say she's my mother, she will gain from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I could have made a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I think this was behind my thinking and it worked somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So we were there, and, and being together with somebody you care for was excellent. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">At the evening, Pepi would teach me history, math, and she would talk to me about her husband, who might be alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">By the way, she found him after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">He survived, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And Pepi was teaching me a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">We, we didn't have a piece of paper or a pencil, but she would teach me a French song or geography, explaining things. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">It helped a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">It helped a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I, I felt real good, and when you when you feel good, you're with somebody, you care for somebody, it makes you feel good; and Pepi cared for everybody, Pepi cared for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">One day I saw Pepi doesn't eat her portion of bread and I said, “What you -- ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="588">She says, “I was hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I ate already.” </span><span class="sentence" id="590">No she didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">There was a Pani Arova who was very, very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">A wife of a Polish major who we knew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zoliborz</span> , where we worked in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I think she lived in the same apart- building. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Pepi found her and since she was elderly, Pepi gave her her portion of bread, but she wouldn't tell me about it, and sure enough when I found out I said, “Then we'll share mine,” and she said “No, you're a young child. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">You have to survive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I mean, I had problems with, with this that she would give away everything to everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">She was just fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">What a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I'm not the only one who, who gained by her being around, who gained so much of everything, of understanding, of love, of helping others. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">She was just fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So then we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we heard some rumors that the war is coming closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">But we didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">This foreman apparently he also felt that Pepi was a nice and a good person, a worthwhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">He somehow let her know that things are going better for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">In other words, things are not going so good for the Germans, and at one time he gave her a piece of paper and a pencil so that she could teach me something. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">She wanted to teach me something to write and, and he, he did that, but we had to give it back right away, so we knew that something is, 1s happening, but we didn't know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And, and the hope was really making us imagine better things, so one day -- it must have been again in March or April, in March, I think, March of '45 -- they put us in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and they sent us to so-called “Free work.” </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Each one was assigned to some deserving German family or on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> to work and this, Pepi and I we were assigned to two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> not far from each other in the northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rostock</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kulingsborn</span> , and she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bornhagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And we were there until May, I think, 5. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">We were liberated by the Russians, who didn't believe that we did not cooperate with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">It, it was hard for them to understand because we were working here on, for a family or for a farmer so they, they just didn't believe that about a month or six weeks ago we were taken out of, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and, and put there for whatever reason, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And that's where we, we were liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="615">What happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">ANSWER:  Well, Pepi made out. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Pepi made out little, called a little -- a travel document, in Russian, and she put some stamps, different colors rubber stamps that mean nothing in German or whatever, whatever she could find in the farmer's, in the <span class="NPIP">farmer's place</span> and the, the Russian that occupied the <span class="DLF">farm</span> that she was, they stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">They made it a <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , and in a couple of days I came running to her because where I was, was terrible, so I stayed with her and she made out those papers and she told the Russians that we want to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">One of them, quite an intelligent fellow, he says, “Well, why don't you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Your daughter will go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and, and you'll be fine and I'll write to my commandant to, to arrange for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So Pepi asked me, “Do you want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I said, “No. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I, I want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and see if I can find somebody alive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So she, she said, “We'll have to think about it, want to see who 1s alive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And they said “Oh, you can find out from there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Just go to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Anyway, Pepi got some kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> that took us, horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> , that took us out and with those papers that she prepared, we got ourselves to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> there was a a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish office</span> on Rikostrasse (ph), a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish office</span> where there were DPs, and we went there to register to, to say that, “We're alive, we're here, and what next?” </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And the funniest thing happened: when I when I was interviewed by the interviewer on Rikostrasse in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , he didn't want to believe that that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I had problems convincing him, but I could prove it. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I could prove it with the names and, and what little I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">It was, the names of my family and, and we had a conversa- a lengthy conversation ‘til, ‘til he believed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">That was another chapter that was very heartbreaking, however, nobody was getting killed and that was the good part. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And the Allies brought some food and some clothing and people were looking for each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">It was just like drunk with freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Everybody was drunk with freedom but looking, “Who...who 1s alive? </span><span class="sentence" id="638">What do we do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="639">But this was the good part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">The bad part of it is that I didn't find anybody when I tried to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Tried to go back and, and didn't find anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">That was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Later on I found my father's brother in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> with his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I found my youngest uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> who went there before the war as a khalutz,'° and then I found that my Aunt Esther and her husband who was in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> survived, and then they found little Jacek, and they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> as a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And that was something out of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">QUESTION:  So when you -- can we come back to you now? </span><span class="sentence" id="647">What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">ANSWER:  I, I was 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , as I said, with Pepi, and we met there. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Actually Pepi, she saw all kinds of people from, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and they were also American Jews, English Jews, French and Russian -- in all the armies. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">That was before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was, was divided by a <span class="DLF">wall</span> ; it was all open. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And Pepi, as usual, decided to, to help out others, so she had me do things to help out others and people who came let's say from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , needed to stay over or go somewhere or get some clothes, being sent being sent wherever they wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">So the majority wanted to go to, to the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Pepi was there to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Oh, yeah, Pepi was there to help, and being with her you couldn't help but help others. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">It was great to be able to do something that you wanted to do, to be able to say, “Yes, you can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">You're free. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Where do you want to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="659">You can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">You're hungry, here’s food,” you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="661">There was a Jewish holiday where they had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I'll never forget that. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Pepi invited all the Jewish people from all the armies. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">She says, “I don't care if they are the French Army, the Russian Army, the American -- it's a Jewish holiday.” '</span><span class="sentence" id="665">© Pioneer (Hebrew). </span><span class="sentence" id="666">They all came together and what a meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I think each one brought something with them because we didn't have much and we had candles and they prayed, and it was a holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I mean, that was after all the, the things that we went through, there was a real Jewish holiday which was celebrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I couldn't communicate with most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Learned a little Russian in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but Pepi knew languages, but it didn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">You could communicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And you could help. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And that was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">It was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">It was like ecstasy. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">It's just later on that everything comes out, when you find out that you don't have anybody anymore and it settles in. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I find that we all carry with us, the survivors I mean, we carry with us a certain something. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I can't put my finger on a certain part in our brain that is different from everybody else in the world who did not go through what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I think that I can recognize a survivor probably from across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , or at least when we exchange a few words. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">There is something about us that I don't find in any other people; maybe the, the sad look in their eyes or maybe some expressions. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I don't know what it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And we all carry that and many times our children do that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">they, although they didn't go through the things we did, they're a part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">They suffer from not having uncles and aunts and cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">They suffer because their parents are overly protective. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">They suffer from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">They do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I get a phone call from my kids every week, whether I need it or not, because I can't live otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">This is, this is the leftover from, from knowing where they are, knowing that they are all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I wish I could change, but I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">They have to understand that that's what I need. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">They do understand it but it's, it's an imposition on people. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">People shouldn't have to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">So, my generation and our children, they carry the burden. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Hopefully, we won’t have that thing happen again and, and the grandchildren will not need to, to carry the burden. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">They, they can learn from history what happened so, so they can prevent it in the future, but they shouldn't need to carry a burden. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Nobody should.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">QUESTION:  Id like -- indeed -- I'd like to come back to know how you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">ANSWER:  Oh, well, I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> after the war finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">We start off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> where Pepi and I stayed and helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And, of course, there were for Pepi, helped in a in a <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and tried, at that time there were, the British wanted to take the orphans out to the <span class="REGION">British zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">They started making the <span class="REGION">zones</span> , <span class="REGION">French zone</span> , <span class="REGION">British zone</span> , you know, and Pepi registered me in the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> so that one day the British came with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they told us to sit down in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they took us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">What I didn't know then which I found out later was that some authority got -- found out that Pepi's helping many DPs and even some soldiers from, from a different army who did not allow their people to, to move, but they wanted to, to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And she was helping and somehow they found out and they came looking for her at night and she ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">She knew that she was being hunted at that time, so she sent me away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  Ok, Let’s take -- I need to go back in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , you are now loaded into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Where are you taken?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  Can you tell us what was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> like at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> was another <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , and I was just talking to -- it was Block RB-6 was the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> where there were some orphans and they brought us in to together so that they could care for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And, of course, many people were ecstatic, they found each other but I couldn't find anybody I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I didn't know too many people before the war started and so I couldn't find many people and they cared for us very well in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , but it was all after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">It, 1t was -- the burden was already there.</span></p>
