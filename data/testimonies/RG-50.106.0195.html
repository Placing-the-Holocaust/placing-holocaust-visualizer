<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Back to well actually in the 17" century, my father’s family came from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">This was during the time of the Spanish invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My mother’s family were Lithuanian and Russian but she herself was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Was she born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  You know I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I would have to look that up. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I did find a friend in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> sent me a clipping once about a direct ancestor of my father’s from mid-19" century who apparently was a very early, all in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and very early on had actually helped his workers to lead somewhat better lives than they normally would have and had been written about at some length. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Sort of an early reformer. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And that’s about it, because my parents were around in the early 30s, when the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My mother was 31. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And that was rather early to have bothered to talk to their parents about you know their own families.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  What kind of work did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  My father was an, had an <span class="BUILDING">art gallery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">He was an art dealer, antiquities dealer as it was called then.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  Did you have any siblings? </span><span class="sentence" id="40">https://collections.ushmm.org
ANSWER:  No, because I was born just before the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">No, I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">But they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">They both had siblings, all of whom died around 1943, or disappeared in 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Was that part of the family also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They, everybody had been pushed into the ghetto which was very, very small in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> before the war and was vastly expanded by the Germans who took over a huge area of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> around the tiny little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and then proceeded to pack it not only with all the Jews they could get their hands on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , but also brought people in from all over <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Obviously since you were born in August of 38, your memories, the initial memories of what happened or the information that you have must have come from your mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So can you say anything that she told you that would pertain to when you were born and what happened after the, you know what the story of the experiences were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  We, my mother and father both, my father never spoke about the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And my mother didn’t speak about it very much either. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">In fact one of the few times she talked about it was when my daughter was taking an ethics course in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and asked her some questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They never wanted to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My mother’s thing was that it was all past, that you couldn’t bring people back and there was simply no point. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">The only things they did talk about was that they, they refused to apply for any reparations when that came up because they felt that there was no, there was no way you could make reparations for what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">My father would sometime talk a little bit about his family but it was always prewar vacations, that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">https://collections.ushmm.org
QUESTION:  So your family obviously before you were born, was a well to do family and as you said they took vacations and they were upper class or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Well middle, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Like most professional, Jews of the professional class in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , they were educated abroad because the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> had a tiny quota of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So my father went to the <span class="BUILDING">Sorbonne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">My mother went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lucerne</span> and my uncles, most of them were educated actually in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zwickau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  What do you know of what happened after you were born. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Obviously you don’t remember this but can you just kind of start the story about the early times of your life, the very early times. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">That you know of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  When the Germans first took over the ghetto area and expanded it and pushed everybody in, my parents traded their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with this artist friend who had a <span class="INT_SPACE">duplex apartment</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which became part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He was not a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And my father moved us and his whole family — his mother, his sisters, brothers, and a niece who was my generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And my mother’s mother into that <span class="INT_SPACE">duplex apartment</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  This, you know I am not totally clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It was, it was I think 1t was more like the fall of 39. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">https://collections.ushmm.org
QUESTION:  Fall of 39.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  They were able to take some money and, and things with them so that they had the means of buying food and so forth for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">My, one of my early memories is of my father’s mother who was baking little you know those little semi round crescent cookies. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So we must have been able to get flour at that point still.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Who lived with you, besides your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  My parents, my grandmother on my mother’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And my grandfather on my father’s side died just before the war and was buried in the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">He died a natural death before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Not natural but I mean — so his mother, my father’s mother and his three sisters, two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">The husband of one of the sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And the daughter of one of the sisters all moved in with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">In this <span class="INT_SPACE">duplex apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">My mother’s mother would go every single day and visit her two brothers and their families who lived, who had moved into some other part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And one day she simply didn’t come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">She just disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I found a reference to one of her, one of her brother’s daughters in Ringelblum’s diary about a twelve year old girl and her death was in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">One of the few — Her maiden name was Batlaj which 1s a Lithuanian name, B-A-T-L-A-J, L being a Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">It’s an L with a diagonal through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So that is — and the widow of one of the brothers, of Henry Batlaj, did survive the war with two children and ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , where my parents never really contacted anyone after. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">They tried but they couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But in recent years, thanks to the internet, I’ve been able to find out that they eventually seem to have all become scientists and one of the women who by now must be the third generation, was https://collections.ushmm.org actually a visiting professor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> about four or five years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And I asked my mother if I could contact her. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And my mother just didn’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">She wanted you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Anyway, my, my aunt on my father’s side and my cousin who was about 13 and the uncle, one uncle, the one who had been educated at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zwickau</span> , one of his fellow engineering students was a German commandant. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And he, they ran into each other in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he arranged for them to work in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> outside the <span class="DLF">gates</span> , which was supposed to be a slightly protected situation so that every day they would all go out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And every day they’d be checked back in. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">My mother was part of the group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  It was men and women?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Probably not the same <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">It was sewing I think in the case of the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And one day they simply didn’t come back, any of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">My father I mean I think my mother was under the impression that this man really had tried to protect them somewhat, but there was nothing that could be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">They, and I don’t know his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But you know they simply would clear the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> out and send the next batch out was the way it was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">My mother when that happened, which was the beginning of 43, my father had sort of, I mean no one really believed the Germans were going to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I mean no one, very few people left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because they, when it was about to happen because they just didn’t, I mean no one believed there was such a thing as an extermination program, obviously.</span></p>

So she brought up her brothers and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">So they were always very much a part of my mother’s family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">They were always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And so were their children who were fairly https://collections.ushmm.org young. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I mean the 20 year old was the oldest, but most of them were 12, 13, 14 because they were that much younger than my mother’s mother had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And of course my mother was only 30 when the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">31, 31. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">When the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">My father was 33. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">And they lost ten years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">But their, so her cousins were you know in their early teens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Pretty much and everybody was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And so everybody in all of those generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">I do remember, I don’t remember her mother and the only picture I have of her is when she was on a visit to <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> and you can’t really see her face particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">I have some pictures on my father’s side of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">That had been sent to friends and so forth and that you know had survived because they had been sent before the war at one time or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">But nothing from my mother’s side at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">You know it just total blank.</span></p>
