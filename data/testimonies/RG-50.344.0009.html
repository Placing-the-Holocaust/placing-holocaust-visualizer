class="SPATIAL_OBJ">back seats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I was thrown out, half my clothes off and I was the only one able to get up the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and wait for somebody to come back and find us, when we didn’t show up. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Lady Feldhusen July 15, 1995 was one of the group that came back and found us. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And to this day, they never put anything in the records. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">This makes us very unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">But, like I say, we were laid up then, taken back to the <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> and fixed up and taken up to our <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , where we laid, side by side on <span

were until we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And then they told me -- I was on crutches and they told me that if I didn’t throw the crutches away, I had to stay over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Well, the rest of the group were coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and one of the girls husband was over there, so she was going to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">That was all right with her, but I wanted to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So I threw the crutches away and hobbled onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> when they finally got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">They were assigned to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">They thought they were going to fly us <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but then something happened to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , so they brought us <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , across the continent, in wooden -- wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench trains</span> with no <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And we slept on th-those overnight, you know, on the trips. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And we stopped along the way and

class="sentence" id="351">And some of the boys from another outfit felt sorry for the nurses, so July 15, 1995 they invited us that -- to come over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deauville</span> , which was a <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> , you know, originally and probably still is -- and spend some time over there in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , so we had- we spent some time in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">swimming areas</span> and so forth, so we had a good time there -- until we were -- actually til we were aboard <span
