<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Now, tell me about ;
ANSWER:  We lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slovakia</span> , and it was a very close-knit family. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My grandfather lived in a great big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and he had three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My mother was the oldest of the three children, and when she was married he built an addition to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we lived right behind his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And my father came from ; <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and they were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">They had three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My oldest sister was Josephine and I, Alice, and then my younger sister was Ellie. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My father was very rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My mother was not quite as rich as my father, but she followed his desires. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And it was a very lovely, sheltered life that we led. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We had a very happy childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My parents -- my mother was naturally totally devoted to her children and to her husband and to doing her housework. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And my father was working in the building industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Actually, he probably started out as assistant in some kind of a locksmith area, but developed into roofing and building materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And he was -- we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , which was very unusual in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convertible</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">scooter</span> (ph), and we were very protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">My -- we loved going in the summertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We loved doing things like going into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and picking wild strawberries, wild flowers, and in the winter we were on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">skis</span> and our skates and sledding from morning to night. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My mother did all the sewing for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We had beautiful homemade, handmade clothes, which my mother made. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And -- which we didn't appreciate, by the way, too much because we did want to have store-bought things. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">But 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I can't remember, but there was a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> where they had ready-made things. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My mother embroidered our underwear very carefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Well, everything was handmade, hand knitted, and it was a very interesting, very different sort of existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My father on Friday, my mother was -- had to get the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ready for sabbath, and in the evening one the children, the three of us, went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Then we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to a wonderful home-cooked meal, which was delicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I always talked about oh, the wonderful things my mother made because I tried to do the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I learned, in fact, from memory to do almost all the things that my mother made. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">There were two or three things I couldn't remember how to do, but I -- in the tape that I did for children, I described in detail all the different menus that we had for our dinners. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">On Saturday, we were not allowed -- after sundown, we were not allowed to put the lights on in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So everything was -- you know, had to, the sabbath had be observed very carefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">On Saturday morning we went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We had to be dressed very carefully with special clothes for Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> with my father, and then after the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and ate whatever my mother had to prepare the day before. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Because, as I said, we couldn't cook or put the lights on on Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And then after our meal, we went for a walk with our father. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We went to visit the different families, Jewish families, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And we walked up and down the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , visiting everybody and in the evening we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Oh, by the way, when -- the first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which we lived behind my grandfather's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we had no electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We lived in a very, very tiny little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">It had a one-room <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , and a very small <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And we had a maid, and I'll tell you how our maid lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">She lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen table</span> which was like a box, and in the evening, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen table</span> -- the top was removed and the box was pulled apart and that was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in which our maid slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And as my father worked himself up and became better well-to-do, better to do, he built a bigger <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was completed in 1938, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We just lived there about a year before we had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And, of course, that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was large, consisted of three different units and then we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">But in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> before that, we did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">The reason I mentioned that 1s because I said that Saturday after our walks when we walked with our father, when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the afternoon, we would sit in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and tell stories and talk and really enjoy each other's company. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And I love those evenings because it was getting dark, and I loved it when it was getting dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And we couldn't put the light on until after the sabbath was over, and then the gas lamp was lit. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">But it was a very, very cozy lovely life as far as the children were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Because my mother worked very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">She had to get up every morning at 6 o'clock in the morning to light the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> so that she could put on the kettle for the coffee and tea, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We had a baker next door, and every morning they would deliver fresh rolls. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Otherwise, my mother did all the -- everything that was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Nothing was bought from a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">That means noodles were made at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and bread was baked, actually, not at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but made and carried over to the baker to be baked. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And then we had these huge loaves of bread that were brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they lasted a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And then my mother made the Friday or Saturday, and everything, in fact, she had to do herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And we, as children, did not really participate too much in the household chores, but we played. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">You know, we played from morning to night. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We had a great life. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I loved it, I always adored the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I loved all the things that it gave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I mean, I, as a child, I was aware of all beauties of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I loved the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and I loved the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And I couldn't wait for the snow to melt for to be -- oh, I loved the feeling of the snow melting in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> because then we could go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and it was big snow drops, which I adored. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Because the snow drops came out even while the snow was still on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Then we looked forward to the spring because we could pick, as I said earlier, wild flowers and wild strawberries, and then- well, we had a cow. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We had chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And I loved all these things, everything was so great, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">My job was to catch the chickens to make -- to see whether they are going to have an egg to lay. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And I did by inserting my little finger into the rear to see whether the egg was there, because I had to lock up the chickens if they were about to lay an egg so that they wouldn't lay them just anywhere, but in a <span class="DLF">coop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And so I -- and then we would ride with my father in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> because he went there on business, and it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convertible</span> and we would sit in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And all the children would gather around us and try to toot the horn because they hadn't seen a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And we would be so thrilled to be going out with him to do these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Well, such a very lovely life, and we traveled in the summertime. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We would travel to visit my uncle, my mother's younger brother, who lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trnava</span> (ph), which was a <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , a very well-known <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And he was director of the <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He was actually the one who saved us in the end because he was -- shall I go back . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Well, tell us about your uncle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Because -- now, I'm just going to give you the life in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , right? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So in summertime, we would visit our uncle in , and in the wintertime, of course, we couldn't wait for winter either because we had enormous amounts of snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lakes</span> froze, our <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> froze; we had very deep ice so we could immediately get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ice skates</span> and skate on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">We would be up and down the <span class="DLF">hills</span> with our sleds from morning to night, and we would also sled across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">We adored it. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And so every season had its special things for us, which we loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We were very protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We didn't really know about politics or what was going on, but our parents spoke several languages, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">My mother, because <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> once belongs to the Austria-Hungarian Empire, when my mother went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the language was Hungarian, okay’? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Also, Slovak, so she spoke fluent Hungarian, fluent Slovak, and she also spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">My -- the Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , where I lived was quite intellectual. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I mean, my uncle went to <span class="BUILDING">Prague University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">He was sent to -- he was very well educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">That was my mother's youngest brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">My mother's sister, younger sister, was also educated and worked with my uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trnava</span> (ph) in the <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I'm not sure what kind of position she had, but she probably had some administrative position. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">She was always very elegant when she came to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">She had always lovely dresses and her lovely silk stockings were very impressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Of course, neither of them were married at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">My mother was the one who was married and had the three children and worked very -- was a dressmaker and everything was just absolutely beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">My mother had excellent taste. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We used to go with her to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> where they sold fabrics, <span class="BUILDING">fabric store</span> , and she would pick things very carefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And she would dress us very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Everything was beautifully made, and we had also lovely ski outfits with beautifully knitted sweaters and my mother, everything was so -- it seemed so beautiful to me when I look back at it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I mean, nobody does things like we had at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And we had my mother's linen was put away -- I mean the way they wash laundry, there was no hot water. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I mean, I remember that they had to take the laundry to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> to rinse it. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And the way we had to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> when we were little, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I'll tell you about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span> which was outside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It was made of metal and it was brought in on the Thursday, I think, every Thursday. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So that we could all take a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And hot water had to be boiled and filled and then the three of us had a bath in that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And then when we had our hair washed, we were very well protected because in those days there was no insulin and so lots of people lost children if they were not well looked after, because they had colds or all kinds of other illnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So my mother was very protective of us and when our hair was washed, she would put a scarf around it, we couldn't go out anywhere, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So, in any case, when I did this -- I did a tape for my children when I told this story about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span> , my sister was very upset with me because she said I shouldn't be telling things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But I thought it was quiet interesting because it was all done very -- you know, it was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We enjoyed having our <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> inside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and then my father got into that water. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Of course, naturally, you couldn't boil enough water for everybody to have fresh bath, so you all managed to get a bath in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tub</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It was a very, very beautiful life. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">That's all I can say about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We loved it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  What about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Were you in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">There was a problem about the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , though. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I had a problem about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We in the minority, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">There was -- I think there was one, only one, maybe two Jewish children in the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And talking about school prayer, that really had an impact on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I really minded very much not to have to -- you know, it was a Catholic country, <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , right? </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So the prayers were said every morning in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> , and I could not -- of course not, I could not participate in that, and I wouldn't, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">My father -- well, I couldn't; I was Jewish, so I couldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But I minded being different, I really -- I mean, if there's a discussion about prayer in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , this really has said something to me because I definitely felt very left out. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And I wanted to very much like everybody else, and since there were so few Jewish children, I felt that I was different from everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I looked forward very much to going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but once I started going, I soon realized that 1t was not so much fun after all, because we were really punished quite severely in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We were punished by being beaten on our hands, you know, with a stick. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Or we had to kneel in front of the class if we did something that was unacceptable in some way or we talked, whatever we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And I was punished quite often, and I had to kneel in front of the class because I clowned around. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And then I got punished some more, and I got hit on my hands quite often, but I did quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We had <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">The <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> , which was like a <span class="BUILDING">junior college</span> , was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which was two hours away from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">My parents decided that my older sister who was very much like my mother, she was very interested in being a housewife -- when she was asked what she wants to be when she grows up, she wanted to be a mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And so it was decided that she was going to go to a <span class="BUILDING">local high school</span> , and when I finished <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , it was decided that I would be going to this <span class="BUILDING">yunior college</span> two hours away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So I traveled every single day by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> two hours to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I got up at 6 -- 5 o'clock in the morning or whatever; 5:30, 6:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">My father walked me through the snow with a lantern to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I was put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , which was about two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> , and we traveled to , which was a <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> , which had a <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And I went to <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> to the -- I didn't have to go to the first year because I took a test, I was very lucky always, which was maybe not luck, but I did a test and they decided that I should go to the second year, started the second year of <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">There were eight years of <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I started in the second. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Of course, I didn't last long because that was 1938, and 1939 I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> every evening from -- every day from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I think at about 3 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> at 3 o'clock, and I got back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> at 5 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And I was walking back from the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , I could -- my father was building this new <span class="BUILDING">house</span> into which we were going to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And I would see him on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ; he was doing it himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I mean, he had help, but he was working very hard to build that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And we -- so schooling was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I mean, you know, I did all right in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  I did -- well, I did and I didn't, let's put it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We had a lot of -- I had a lot of non-Jewish friends, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But the people who were worse off than I were the Gypsies. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We had a little Gypsy girl, her name was Suzie, Suzka (ph), and she was not allowed to -- she had to sit by herself in the class in the back row. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I mean, I was part of the whole -- I mean, just like everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">The only thing that was different was the school prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But she was completely ostracized. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">She was sitting in the back row, and she was not allowed to -- nobody sat next to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I was sort of -- felt very sorry for her, and I used to -- I had made sort of a friendship with her, but she was worse off. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I minded taking the Jewish holidays, not going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> during the Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I minded that, because everybody else was in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> and I was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And then I minded very much not participating in the Christmas and other holidays because we had a maid and she would take us -- I mean, we had lots of <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">It is a very -- it was mainly Catholic, very religious sort of community. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">In the wrong sense, they were not religious 1n the sense of being good. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">But they were in the religious going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , that's about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Because they had came to it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Most of them, I mean, many of them -- I don't know how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I don't want to go into it, but there were no Germans that entered our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So whatever was done to the community, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , was done by the local people. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">You know how this turned out. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I mean, I didn't really investigate it too deeply, but I know there were no Germans in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And I think that most of the things that happened to us, to our people, were greed. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Because everybody expected or thought that we were all rich, that all the Jewish people were rich, which they weren't. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Everybody was working very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">It's true that most of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were owned by the Jewish people, but they were little <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> eking out a small living. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And I think that -- I don't know, my parents protected us a great deal from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , so I don't know that I felt -- I did feel different in having to take the days off for the Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , my <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">After I went to <span class="BUILDING">Gymnasium</span> , I was out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I didn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">local schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But then all the kids went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I was outside the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and I felt so different. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I didn't like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I felt that I was -- I wanted to be like the others, that was the main thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And I think that was the main thing about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  But people weren't calling you names or...
ANSWER:  Oh, they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">They were, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And there were very many things like that, but, I don't know, one sort of learned to live with it, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I minded. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I mean, yes, people were always calling us names. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">But I seemed to get over it the best I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I mean, I didn't seem to -- yes, I guess I must have. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I did mind it, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And I never particularly remembered that so much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  But these were your friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  Oh, my friend, my best friend, was the daughter of the mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">My father -- going back to my father, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">My father was extremely popular in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> because he was very handy. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">He could do things that other people couldn't do. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">When a cross fell from one <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in a storm, my father was the one who climbed the steeple to put the cross back up. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And everybody stood in the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> watching him do it, and I thought always that my parents would survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">All through the war, I thought my parents would survive because of the sort of things he did in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">He was very popular, and once when there was a fire and the mayor was drunk, my father broke down the <span class="DLF">door</span> to the fire engine and got it out and drove to the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">He was very liked in the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">He was a hard working man who worked from morning to night, and he did all sorts of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We had a little bit of a -- we didn't have a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , but we had a plot of <span class="REGION">land</span> , and he did all things like everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">He worked just as much as that, and he was liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And I thought people would look after him, but they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I don't really know all the details of what went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">When I read my mother's letters, which I haven't read, maybe I'll find out more. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">But the problem is that my parents would not have written anything that was going on, because they would have been trying to protect us from that kind of information. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So they -- so, unfortunately, I wish my mother would have been more open about what was happening to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">But, you know -- you were asking me about...
QUESTION:  Well, we were talking a little bit being Jewish in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> but I think you've talked about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  I'm sure there was a lot -- there was quite a lot of name calling in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">They called, not me particularly, but they would call all people who were selling eggs or people who were poor and old, they were calling them names and throwing stones and doing things, I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">There was a lot of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">But, and I told you, we were very protected and we were very close close-knit community in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And our parents were -- looked after us and didn't let us see much of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And -- but I did mind, for instance, of course, there were so many <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> that I told you, and there was Christmas everywhere, you know, and we didn't participate. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And I didn't like that, I love Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I thought Christmas was very appealing, and the snow was beautiful, and people were selling all these lovely decorations for the Christmas trees and we couldn't have any.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  You said you were protected, you really didn't have too much sense of what was going on outside of your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  You were somewhat isolated. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I'm just wondering if you had heard or read anything about Hitler or the Nazi Party in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or if you think your family had any information about what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Of course, my parents, obviously did have something. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">There was a lot of whispering going on, and there were people coming to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">We knew something that it was going on, but they didn't tell us too much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">But we knew something awful was happening, but we didn't know -- I mean, who would have thought anything like this? </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I mean, we didn't -- we knew, we knew something, but not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Our parents did not discuss with us the details about what was going on, but we had a radio and my mother turned the radio on, and I could hear somebody screaming, Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And then there was fear of this awful occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I mean, when <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> fell, we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And, of course, we knew very much because lots of refugees came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">The reason they came at night mostly after <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> fell, my father walked them across the <span class="DLF">border</span> of Carpathian (ph) Mountains to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because many of the refugees came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And my father and some other men knew the way to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I mean, there were <span class="DLF">borders</span> everywhere, so it wasn't -- so it was an illegal entry into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So my father -- we knew that he was doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Lots of people, we were right on the northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , which is not very far from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But I knew that my father was doing that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  So rather than staying in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , they were all headed toward <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  Oh, no, they didn't come to stay to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">They came to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">They came to maybe various points in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , but the ones that came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> came only to cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">They didn't come to stay; there were no refugees to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">They just came to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  At what point did the effect of the German effort start impacting your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  After the occupation in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , which was March 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We were occupied in March '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">At that point, just before the occupation, everybody was very patriotic, and they felt against -- of course, don't forget we were surrounded by lots of "enemies," in quotes, because at that -- well, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was very patriotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">We were all big patriots, and we were very much against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , against Austrian -- against <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , because it was an Austria-Hungary empire at one time which was -- and then we were liberated in 1918, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Everybody was -- <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was not particularly -- 1t was an enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We were, <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , surrounded by all these outside <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> which were once our occupiers, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So at first when there was a noise about being occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , everybody was very patriotic, having a Czech flag in the lapel, and my friend, my best friend, , who was the daughter of this mayor, took this flag away from me and said, "You are not entitled to wear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">You are a Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And then afterwards, after we left, she felt very bad about it, because she went to see my mother -- I know that she went back from one of her letters, that she did go and see my mother after we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So she obviously felt some sorrow about it, so when <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> fell, that's when we, of course, immediately knew that this was a disaster of the greatest order. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">That morning I used to have to get up at 6 o'clock in the morning to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">That morning I woke up and it was daylight, and I was very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And I said, "How come I'm not up to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And I heard the radio and the noise -- and the shrieking of Hitler, and my mother and father stood by the radio in terror. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And they said, "You're not going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore," because they were too afraid to send me by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to ; and so they would send , and so I stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">local school</span> , and I was not enrolled in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">But I went as -- I just sat there on the classes, and one day when I was sitting in the class -- I was not participating, I was just listening to what was going on -- I looked out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I saw a couple of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> in the square. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And I looked and watched what was going on, and I saw some Jewish families being put on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">It was not my family, and not my grandparents, not my parents, but some poor families from out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And I was shocked, of course, and I didn't know what was happening, and I found out later they put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and drove them to the <span class="DLF">Hungarian border</span> because they were just going to drop them off. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I mean, they were told to pack up and they were going to be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And they dropped them off on the <span class="DLF">Hungarian border</span> , and left them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And, of course, it was a great shock to me, and I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I was grateful it was none of my family, but, you know, I was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I mean, it was very shocking. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">It was the beginning when I realized things were -- I mean, it was so frightening that one didn't dare to think too much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I mean, at least I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">My parents did not discuss these things with us, which was too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">But I guess they wanted to protect us. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">So the next thing that happened was that men were put on horses -- were asked to ride horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">The Jewish men were asked to -- these were not horses for riding. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">These were cart horses, you know, and they were to ride them to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which was sort of a torture thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">They got some men to do this, and, of course, 1t was terribly difficult for them to do that, and how can you ride these horses? </span><span class="sentence" id="311">It was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">It was a form of torturing these men. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">My father was also not -- I think he was not asked to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">But some men were gathered to send to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and the other things that happened had to do hard labor in the street work. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">They gathered the Jewish men, and they had to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And then my grandfather was very outspoken, and something happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">He stood out on his <span class="DLF">front steps</span> and started screaming at somebody who painted something on his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And it was all very scary; very, very frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So how did we know we were leaving?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  Well, who is giving these orders?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  Who was giving -- well, there was still two priests that became head of the Fascist Party in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="322">The one main priest was -- it was Hlinka, H-l-i-n-k-a, Hlinka was a priest and the Slovaks who joined his political party were called the Hlinka Guard, and they were men with arm bands, Slovaks. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And the other priest was called Tiso, T-i-s-o, and he also became a Fascist and he was -- both these men wanted to separate from <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> , which is the <span class="COUNTRY">Czech Republic</span> now, and have an independent <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Well, Hitler allowed them to do that because Hitler -- then <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> became, you know -- well, I'm not quite sure now, you see, how that worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="325"><span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> , which was the <span class="REGION">Czech Republic</span> , was occupied, but <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> became sort of a protectorate of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So it was participating in this with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , it was not occupied as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">QUESTION:  Did government troops come into your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , or did the local people you had grown up with enforce this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  I think it's the local people that enforced it. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I didn't see any government troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I mean, as far as I know, there were no government troops, but the local people who joined the Hlinka Guard must have participated in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I never saw a German soldier come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But, of course, you know, we left in '39, so I don't know what happened afterwards, but as far as I know, it was local people. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And there could have been some other officials of some, who were sent from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , but I think it was the local people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  Were there restrictions placed on the Jewish family? </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Was property stolen? </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Did any of that sort of thing take place?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  No, not while we were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">But shortly afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Now, we -- my uncle, as I told you, lived in -- was the director of the Trnava (ph) spa in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And, as such, he was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in the '30s. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">By the way, my uncle was excellent - an excellent uncle to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">You see, the only person who was married of the three children of my grandfather was my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Her younger sister was not married, and my uncle wasn't married at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So he was extremely good. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I mean, he adored the three of us, and he was very, very good uncle, model uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But he was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to represent the <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> , and he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And so he saw, from 19 -- I'm not sure what year he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> -- but let's say it was 1934, '35, '36. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I'm sure that was the year that he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">He saw what was going on, so he was very aware of what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">My parents just never left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , so they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Nobody could imagine what would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">But my uncle lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ; he married a woman from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And then he was transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and he became a representative of the <span class="BUILDING">Spa</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">He's the one who wrote my parents that it would be wise to send us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Now, he ever -- and I can't begin to grasp that, because why would this man take on the responsibility? </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I mean, who would have thought something would happen to us? </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I mean, we were so remote from the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , but he said, "I think it's wise to send the children away." </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And he said he can make arrangements for us to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">When my parents -- that is again, a tremendous mystery -- how they ever agreed to do this is beyond me. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I will never understand it, and I think it's amazing if you would know, if you were to know the kind of life we had and how we lived, that my parents agreed to put the three of us -- I mean, to put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Now, I don't know much about -- unfortunately, my uncle died so I can't ask him anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I wish I could have asked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">All these things came up later because I really didn't deal with all these things until a few years ago when I started to think that I better put it all down somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And I should have asked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">But, of course, his wife is still alive, and I could ask her, but she won't remember why he initiated the whole process. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Or she might, she's very intelligent, bright woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">She might. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So maybe if she's still alive when I get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , I'll ask her. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">But my uncle wrote -- I didn't see the letters, but there was a lot of talk, you know, between my parents discussed it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Lots of people came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> during those times when we were occupied in March. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">They said they think that people were very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">My father was extremely religious, I told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And they would come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and say "Where is God?" </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And to me, that's sin, such a, you know, question of people who are religious to ask that. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And then we thought this must be really a very, very serious business, if people -- I mean, people were really talking about it, but they did not include the children with talk so that I wasn't part of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I could only hear these fringe sayings things like "Where 1s God?" </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And the fact that my parents agreed to send us will be a mystery for as long as I live, but that wasn't everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So my uncle's letters went back and forth between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">My parents must have agreed, I don't know why, how. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">We were the only ones, and everybody said to them "How can you do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="382">How can you send your children away? </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Nothing is going to happen here." </span><span class="sentence" id="384">But my parents started to work very hard towards getting us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">That meant that my father had to spend an awful lot of money to get us passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">He started to get the passports for the three of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Then my mother started to sew and to accumulate clothes for three years ahead, all sizes up to the ages of each of us for three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And they started getting us ready for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">My father got the passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">My mother packed. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">We all had our suitcases. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And one day they said, "You're going to visit Uncle Hine (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> ."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a couple of questions, and I'll let you continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">In all this back and forth about whether or not you would go, did they ever discuss it with you, say, "Do you want to go?"</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Maybe they did, maybe they -- I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I can't remember that part whether they discussed it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I don't remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">QUESTION:  Did you have a lot of time to prepare for this transfer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We prepared quite a long time because my mother was sewing for a long time, and there's a play called " Transport," I don't know whether you have seen it. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">It was here recently, a few months ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And the mother was preparing us in every sort of way, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Teaching -- my older sister already knew how to sew, but she was teaching us how to do things to look after ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Then my older sister was the one who was made to take care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I mean, you know, my mother, she was instructed very carefully to take care over. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">That she would be the acting mother, she was 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">She was one month -- had she been one month older, she wouldn't have been able to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Because the transport only took -- as far as I remember, there were children from six months to 16, and my sister was just 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">She would have been 16 in August, and I think they started preparing -- we were occupied in March, so I think immediately after that, my uncle must have started the correspondence and so from March until the transport, which left sometime at the end of June.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">QUESTION:  What other things were your parents trying to teach you or guide you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER:  About going...
QUESTION:  About leaving <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  Well, the main thing they were interested in is that we should be very close together. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">In other words, we shouldn't argue, that we should love each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">That we should be very close together, and, of course, be very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I mean, everything a parent would teach a child and they instructed, we were told how to behave, how to be -- how to be religious, which we didn't -- I did not stay religious at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">In fact, I could not face religion after that at all because I thought I couldn't go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> because it was to painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And they taught us how to behave properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">All the things a parent would teach a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">They told us, my mother tried to teach us how to take care of ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">She taught my sister how to do sewing. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">She gave her -- I mean, she told as much as she could with everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">She taught us it's better to learn, to be good, to take care of ourselves, to be careful of strangers, men, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">What else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  Did they know or could they tell you where you were going and what that life would be like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="427">ANSWER:  No, they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">In fact, that was one of the big disappointments. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They didn't know -- maybe they knew from my uncle, but we didn't know because we were absolutely shocked when we got to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and found that we were going to a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  We'll get to that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="442">QUESTION:  I want to check the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">How much time do we have left? </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Videographer: Eight minutes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  Oh, you're doing pretty well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  But I can't remember how I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I mean, obviously, we were excited, frightened, and we didn't -- I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Those last days are very, very mixed up because I can't really understand -- well, I don't exactly how we felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">All I know is that it was -- there was an element of all these feelings of fear, of excitement, and curiosity, and not feeling that one was escaping something. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">You know, because it wasn't there yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I mean, I didn't think that anything would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I mean, how would I have known? </span><span class="sentence" id="457">It's very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Well, I can tell you the day that we left, but you want to start on it now?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="491">QUESTION:  You were describing the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">There were a lot of people there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">QUESTION:  A lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Was the mood one of -- was it normal?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">That's how it was, it was very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Everyone was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">The kids were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">The parents were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulled away, and we all waved goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And this other -- well, another thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">My mother, we each had a gold chain and a gold bracelet and my mother said, "It's not a good idea to have this." </span><span class="sentence" id="504">My father may have said it. "</span><span class="sentence" id="505">Why don't you let us keep it for you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And they took it off, and they said, "Don't travel with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">It's not a good idea to do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="508">So they took our little jewelry that we had which is very minor, possibly, I know that we each had a chain and maybe something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I can't remember, but they decided to keep it for us and took it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">The moment the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulled away, the people who were organizing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> asked whether we have any jewelry, and if we didn't, could we carry some for other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And so my -- each of us was given a couple of bracelets to put under our sweater to carry for somebody else who had too much maybe.</span></p>

QUESTION:  One question about when you left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  ... at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Was there a party? </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Did you say goodbye to your friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">We went to see all the families and said goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">There may have been a party or two and all my girlfriends, because I left my very close friends behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Hilda Lazera (ph) was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Maria Berteria (ph) was another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">She was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And we went to say goodbye to everybody, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And that was -- I don't have too clear a memory of that, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Of course, my grandparents, and teachers, and <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">We were the only ones leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">In all that, people -- many people thought my parents were completely mad to send us away, and I'm sure that they had great doubts and they worried about it, whether they were doing the right thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">But I have a consolation about that because my father in one of the letters which I have has written at one point "I'm so glad you're not here." </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So I know that they felt -- I mean, that it was -- especially when the young girls were being taken away, I think that he suddenly realized -- not suddenly, I think that he wrote to us saying, "I'm so glad you're not here," although they must have been absolutely petrified about what was going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , because there was the propaganda about the air raids. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">We lived through the Blitz, London Blitz in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So they must have been very fearful what was happening, but it was better to be in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> with the bombs than to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> with all the disasters that were going on, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Did you want me to tell you about our leaving? </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Of course, it was very, very emotional about all those children were in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And there was another little girl that jomned us. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Her name was Eva Rothberger (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="545">She was also 10 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">My sister -- by the way, my older sister was 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I was just then 14, and my younger sister was 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Another little girl joined us, the daughter of a friend of my uncle's. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Her name was Eva Rothberger (ph), and she came with us, so there were four of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And there were lots of children in the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> , and they were frightened, excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And so other kids in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , so I suppose we didn't know what to expect, but what our father told us that we were going to go through <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and that because it was Friday night, we would get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and spend the summer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> or The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> , I'm not sure where we went through, but I think it's in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And so we were quite excited about that, but when we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> on Friday evening, we were told that the Dutch authorities didn't want us to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I think they were afraid of too many refugees being dropped off on the <span class="DLF">border</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So they decided that they were not to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">So instead, lots of people came to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> with hot chocolate and bars of chocolate and cookies and they handed these things over to us through <span class="DLF">windows</span> 1n the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And I was very, very grateful about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I thought it was very kind, although I was very disappointed and felt terrible that they didn't want us. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">That the Dutch authorities didn't want us to get off, I couldn't -- I mean, that was very painful for me to think that these people didn't want us. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And I couldn't understand it, but then I was very happy that these people came and I was grateful to see these people at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> doing something for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So I guess I consoled myself with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Now, we crossed the -- we were very frightened when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because there was an inspection. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">The German uniformed soldiers came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , all of the -- and they inspected our luggage. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And we were frightened, and, of course, once we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we were all thrilled and cheered like crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">We were thrilled to be out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and said, "Now, we are -- okay, we are safe." </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And then we got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  I want you to tell me more about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">What you were doing, were you playing games? </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Did you get to know -- who were all of these other kids? </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Did you make any stops along the way? </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Were there guards on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">ANSWER:  The people who accompanied us were young people, mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">As far as I remember, they were young volunteers like probably people in their 20s. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And they were from Jewish organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I'm not sure who they were, but they just accompanied the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">They were to come back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  They were Czech?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  They were Czech, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">As far as I know, but Mr. Winter, again, I will ask him that, because he will know. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And I don't know, but I know there were people who were specially, you know, assigned to accompany this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And as far as I know, they were to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">They did not have the permits to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So whatever did we do on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I don't -- we didn't do very much, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">We were just -- we may have played a game or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I don't have a clear recollection of the ride itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I only remember of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I remember the fact that somebody asked us to carry jewels, jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And I think mostly my younger sister, my little sister was 10 years old, was given some jewelry to put on her arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And there were three of us, so we were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Whereas, there were many children who were by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">So we felt fortunate in that, that at least we have each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">It was very important, because little Eva came by herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">She was 10 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And there were lots of other children, some of them were crying, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And we tried to be brave, that's all I can tell you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">QUESTION:  Did you -- was it crowded? </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Did you sleep? </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Did you look out the <span class="DLF">window</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">No, that's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I looked out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I was going to mention that. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I did look out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and I tried to do the best I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I mean, we -- I don't know what my sister felt, and I don't know what my little sister -- my little sister was absolutely petrified, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">She was very, very attached to her mother, and her mother was very attached to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">She was attached to all three of us, but the baby was a baby, after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And don't forget that although we were 15 and 14 and 10, I could never find an equivalent age. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I mean, we were much younger than that compared to the children -- my children at that age, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="608">When my children were about -- when I had children, I could never find -- I was always looking to see their equivalent age that my children and I was at the age of 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And I felt that my children at the age of eight were more grown up and more sophisticated than I was at the age of 14, because it was a different world. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">It was all completely different, and they were brought up quite differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So I don't know why, I tried to make the best of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I thought of the things that we were going to do, and so, and see my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And I never for one moment imagined that we would not come back to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And, of course, I was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I must have been terribly afraid, but I just didn't let myself feel it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">QUESTION:  Did you see anything special when you were looking out the <span class="DLF">window</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  Just the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> going by. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Being -- being glad to be out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="621">QUESTION:  Were there any rules? </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Did the people who were in charge of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> tell you anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">ANSWER:  I don't remember anything about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> except <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION:  Tell me about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="639">QUESTION:  Had you ever been on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> like that before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I've never been that far away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I've never been on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And I think people were sick because it was a <span class="DLF">channel crossing</span> , and 1t must have been -- I remember, maybe I was sick, too, and I can't recall it. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">It must have been awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">But when we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , which was very, very exciting -- again, it was just the -- all I remember 1s this hundreds of children with tags with the numbers in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And a loud speaker, people were picking up the kids that were being assigned to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">It was enormous commotion and I was -- and our name was not called for the longest time. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And we waited and waited for a long time, and finally our name was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And there was our uncle picking us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And he came with my guardian because we each, in order to get us to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , he had to get a guardian for each of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And that meant that he needed a signature for each of us, I think that's the way it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">But each child had to have a guarantor, and my uncle got guardians for all three of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">My older sister, Josie, and my younger sister, Ellie's, guardian was Marin Marais (ph), who was a pianist, a famous pianist. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And my guardian was Ms. Fannie Bandit (ph), who was a violinist. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">My uncle came to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> to pick us up with Fannie Bandit, my guardian, who was a spinster, very well-to-do. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And she came to actually to meet us at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and my uncle said, "Now, we are going to drive to where you are going to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burgess Hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">It's a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And we were absolutely shocked about that because we thought we were going to stay with my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I didn't know we were going to a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And I'm not sure, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Well, of course, my uncle -- it was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I understood why it happened, but my older sister was very, very upset with my uncle because she thought that he should take my little sister, who was 10 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">But my uncle was in a very precarious position because he was just newly married, and he had a baby, and they had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And I think his wife was not inclined to take a child, although she says -- and she's very close to us -- I mean, wherever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">She says that she participated, that she was the one who did most of the work to get us out of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">But she was not the sort of person who wanted to take a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I mean, she just -- I don't know how that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">But anyway, the three of us went to this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sussex</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">It was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wyberley</span> , W-y-b-e-r-l-e-y. It used to be a <span class="BUILDING">convalescent home</span> for Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">It was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burgess Hill</span> , <span class="REGION">Sussex</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">It was in beautiful <span class="DLF">grounds</span> , a lovely <span class="NPIP">place</span> , lovely <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And they built sort of an addition in the back of this huge <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where we were being housed, the children were being housed. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">When we arrived, I can't tell you how it was very painful that my uncle took us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">You know, very painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And it was such a trauma that I don't remember whether we even went to see his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> first. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Whether we went to visit our aunt, but we may have gone to visit the aunt and the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Because that's another thing why we looked forward to going to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ; he had a baby and we had a new cousin only about a year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">His name was Steven, and we wanted to see him very much because my mother was always talking to us about this new baby that we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">SO we were very anxious to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Whether or not we went to see him before we went to this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I don't know anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">But what I think is we drove -- the reason my guardian came to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , because she had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and my uncle did not have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And so she was able to drive us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sussex</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">When we arrived in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we were absolutely stunned again. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">So absolutely shocked because everybody in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">There were no Czech children there at all except us. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And we were extremely Czech -- we were so patriotic, and we wanted to be with Czech children. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">We didn't want to be with -- even though we were Jewish refugees, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">There were about 50 children in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and they were all from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , from all over German, and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="689">QUESTION:  All Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">They were all Jewish children there. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">It was a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which had a matron and lots of nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">It's very elegant as far as I was concerned, I couldn't get over all the beautiful elegance of the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">It had a <span class="DLF">tennis court</span> , and it had beautiful green lawns, and huge <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Beautifully, everything -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> were shiny as can be, and all the staff that looked after us, <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> which was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="696"><span class="NPIP">Places</span> were set for breakfast just in the best style you can imagine, and next to each setting there was a banana or piece of fruit for breakfast and cereal. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I mean, I had never seen things like that in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">We never had things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">So there were very exciting things, but it was a terrific letdown. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I have a diary which I wrote my, what a shock it was for us to come into a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where everybody spoke German and English. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And we didn't speak a word of English, and we didn't speak much German either. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">We didn't speak any German, in fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And suddenly we were placed 1n this thing, and they thought we were little hicks because they were all from big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">So that was a big shock to us, but we adjusted quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">We adjusted very quickly to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and my uncle came the first holiday to come and get us. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And we spent a week with him at Christmastime and a week one other holiday, so we did travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to spend time with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">But my older sister has never forgiven his wife for not taking my younger sister because my younger sister later had lots of difficulties because we had to, you know, we only stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for a short period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">About a year and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Because when war broke out, that <span class="REGION">area</span> became restricted and we had to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">QUESTION:  Did they teach you in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We learned English. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">We had all kinds of nice things in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I mean, the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">We had a matron and everything was done very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">QUESTION:  Did you observe Jewish holidays?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Uh-huh, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">That's one thing, when we went to visit my uncle for a holiday in my diary, which I decided to read recently, I have a notation that we went to see my uncle and it was during a Jewish holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And we were so shocked to find that we went to a movie, and it was a Jewish holiday and we were really glad to get back to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because we were able to observe the second night of Shabbat. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Because my uncle, we did nothing at my uncle's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and we were glad to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wyberley</span> , to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because at least there we celebrated the holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">So, you see, my -- so we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Played tennis. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">We learned to play tennis. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">We went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">We learned all kinds of things there, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">But, of course, it was still a very lonely <span class="NPIP">place</span> for many of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">We shared -- we lived in a <span

class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we stayed because we didn't stay in the main <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">We -- as I said earlier, there was an addition built to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a temporary addition, to house the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So we all lived in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was a temporary thing, and we shared -- I mean, there were nine in our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">There were nine children. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And we had all kinds of things that were being done for us, all kinds of tutoring. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And my older sister had to help in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And eventually, I -- there were big girls and little girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">The little girls were like my little sister, and the big girls were like my older sister, 15 and 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And the big girls had to look after -- each big girl had a little girl to look after like combing hair and doing things for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , where all the big girl had to take care of the little girl, going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and coming back from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">So we were taken care of quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And my uncle, we were in touch with him a lot, and we had pocket money, six pence a week for which had to buy stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">We had mail from our parents because my parents found a way to communicate with us via <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , before <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> -- because <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was not in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And through the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , my father had a brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and a sister -- I think it was stepbrother and stepsister in <span class="REGION">Vermont</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And my mother got in touch with those families and wrote them and asked would -- if they would take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">So my uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> whom I've never met immediately started to proceed to try to get us over to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And I have letters and affidavits which they immediately started to do, but it was too late because, first of all, we didn't even want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">The three of us didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">We wanted to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> because we didn't want to go that far away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="749">But my other uncle would -- did everything he could to try to get us over, and he would send us letters and in the letter, he would sometimes send us a dollar or two dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And it was thrilling because we had so little money that we were always thrilled when we got a dollar, which was then five shillings, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">In any case, we didn't really want to go away from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="753">We wanted to stay together and go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">That was our thought, but we were so relieved when we didn't have to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="755">But my uncle wrote in this letter saying that they have enough resources to take care of all three of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Well, we stayed...
QUESTION:  What were your parents saying in their letters? </span><span class="sentence" id="757">It must have been great to get their mail.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  Oh, in the letters, my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Well, we wrote a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">They sent us packages, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And we wrote a lot of letters, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And they were very, very grateful because -- and they were always in -- well, I haven't read my parents' letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I have about, maybe, 30, 40 letters; I haven't read them because it's too painful to read my mother's letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">But I am going to read them, and I'm going to translate them because -- not only for myself, but for my children and for whoever might want to see them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">QUESTION:  But at the time, do you have sort of a vague recollection of what they wrote about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">They wrote -- unfortunately, I wish they would have written exactly what was going on, but they wouldn't, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Why would they tell the children painful things? </span><span class="sentence" id="769">But it must have been very, very difficult for them already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And it must have been -- and they wrote a little bit about my grandfather who obviously was having a terrible time because he had to leave his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="771">His <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was taken over by somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And they put him into some kind of a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> somewhere where he had no <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Because my mother wrote saying that it must be very hard for her father to be living without a <span class="DLF">window</span> , so I don't know where they had put him. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And they wrote us things like sent us recipes because we said be sure to send us a recipe about this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And then we would write them to say what we were doing, what we're learning, and what we were sewing, and what we were crocheting, and what we were knitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And we would describe in great detail what we got for our birthdays and what -- we just gave them the most enthusiastic reports about our life in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And they were just thrilled about getting the letters, of course, and they would say how grateful they were that we were such good children and that we were telling them, that we were writing to them so regularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Because that's the only thing, of course, that they had that was joyful. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And they sent us -- I remember my mother sent us packages of knitted things, sweaters, and cookies probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Whatever she could do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">QUESTION:  Were you homesick?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">ANSWER:  Oh, terribly homesick. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Many of the children in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> were very fortunate because they were just there temporarily until their parents got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Those were the worst times in our lives when other children's parents came to get them. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Because we felt terribly envious, I should say, but at the same time, we were too ashamed not to be happy for the child, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Because you had to be happy for the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">But, on the other hand, you knew that you never, your parents are never going to come out because the war had started and it was -- and it was just completely -- well, completely hopeless. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">We could have done -- I always wonder whether we could have done something to get them out, but we didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Because, first of all, it was July and August, two months, and the war broke out in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So after that, it was Over; you couldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">So we only would have had two months to do something in. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Then my mother wrote to say that my grandmother came to stay with them from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and so that they couldn't leave anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And I feel my parents were -- my father was very enterprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">My mother was a very bright, intelligent woman, and they would have certainly tried to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">My father always wanted to leave long before we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">He wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , but my mother wouldn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">He wanted to, he would have gone long ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">He was a great Zionist, he would definitely left long ago if my mother -- but my mother would not leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Because my mother's family has been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> for many generations, and my mother was very, very assimilated into the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">So she would not, she didn't want to leave to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="801">But my father may have tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Well, he would have gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Where would he have gone? </span><span class="sentence" id="804">If he had escaped, he would have probably gone into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , which was going to be the end, the worst end. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Or maybe they might have continued on to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , I don't know where they would have gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">But my uncle -- I know that my husband's aunt, who came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , got everybody out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Certain people, because she went around -- but she was much older. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">She was in her 30s late, and she went around and she got signatures for all her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Now, we were too little to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Now, if I reproach myself about anything at all, it is because I felt if we had been a little older we might have been able to get my parents out. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">But who know? </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">In any case, so they wrote us these -- my mother wrote these long letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I said to her in my letter "We're off the <span class="DLF">road</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And I have a couple of those letters because when I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and I was given that book, a book with some photographs, among those things were two of our letters, which I was just amazed how well we wrote. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And, well, when...
QUESTION:  You mentioned that you kept a diary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">ANSWER:  Yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">I kept a diary while I was at this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">QUESTION:  What kind...
ANSWER:  Which is very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I'm sorry now that I didn't keep it more carefully, but I kept it for about until about 1941, when I stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Because in 1941, we had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="822">Suddenly -- you see, this <span class="REGION">area</span> was near the <span class="DLF">coast</span> , and besides the money -- whoever supported this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , whichever organization supported which could have been American. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I think American and British, I don't know who did. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I don't know where the money came from actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">That stopped and also that <span class="REGION">area</span> was restricted and everybody had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">So we had to be -- this is where the problems started. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">We had to be sent somewhere, and that became a great, big problem because where to send the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">What to, you know -- oh, I have to go back to when I told you about parents coming to get the children, it was very, very painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">The other thing which was extremely for me, but I'm a great -- I'm able to sort of push it aside and look at the more positive things and to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I'm a survivor, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">When I went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and I saw parents walking with their children hand in hand, that broke my heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">I used to be terribly upset about that because I felt -- that's when I felt the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">You know, but, otherwise, you look forward in the letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I mean, that's about it, and the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Then we had to worry about what to do because everybody had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And my little sister -- the older children had to leave first. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And that's it began to dawn on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Of course, there were air raids. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">While we lived already in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> still, air raids started. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">But we were -- well, we had to be sort of split up because my older sister was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and she went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">There was a young women's home run by a Jewish refugee woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">She had an ordinary <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which she had housed, maybe she had 10 or 12, 20 girls who lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">It was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that was a <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And she provided breakfast and dinner, and she also ran something called the British Restaurant, where she cooked where you could buy cheap meals. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">But I think she just ran the <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> ; it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hampstead</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">So my sister was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and she went to that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And she -- but she had to be self-supporting, so she went to work in a <span class="BUILDING">dressmaker shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And she was -- then whatever she earned, she paid in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">My younger sister was sent to some families not far from the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where we were at. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">And she lived with some Quaker families, and she was very, very unhappy about having to be split up from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">She was very heartbroken about that because she just didn't want to leave us, but there was no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">This is where my older sister blamed my uncle, that he should have taken her. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">But by this time, my uncle has lost his -- there was no job because the representation from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> when the war broke out, that was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">There was no more income, and he was not qualified to do -- he was an engineer, chemical engineer, but he had no job. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">The war started, and he didn't have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">At that point, he couldn't have taken her. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Or maybe he could have, and they could have done the best they could with the little they had, but they just didn't take her. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And that, at this point, it 1s that my sister blames them because she felt they should have taken my little sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Now, my little sister, even though my older sister and my little sister had this guardian, Myra Hess (ph), who I think paid the money that was only a cash transaction, I think she guaranteed for 70 children, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">She didn't have anything personally, she drove a -- so my little sister had a hard time because I don't know what kind of family she stayed with, but she was moved around a great deal from family to family. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And she told me that on Friday afternoons in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they would say, "Who is going to take Ellie? </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Who can take Ellie for maybe next week or next holiday?" </span><span class="sentence" id="863">or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And she just remembers that mainly that people would ask who will take her. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">But then she had some positive things about staying with those families because she did have it regular. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">She went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> through the entire system. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">She matriculated and she did everything that any English child does. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">She did have that privilege. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">She went through the entire system of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Now, with me it was a different story. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">When I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and there was guardian, Fannie Bandit, who was just -- she was wonderful in one respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">She just loved having this child, me. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">But she didn't want me to live with -- I mean, there was no question of my living with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Although she lived in a very elegant <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on Penchley (ph) Road, and she had a housekeeper and I used to go to -- I was invited for lunches and whatever, and it was splendidly elegant. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I can't tell you how beautiful and elegant it was because she was a grand lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And she -- I mean, when I was invited for lunch, everything was set up just as if it was an important visitor had come, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I mean, the crystal and the silver and the dishes, and we would go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and then the housekeeper would come and serve the meal from the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And we had to help our -- I mean, I learned all my good manners at my guardian's and she had this beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> that flushed. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And she had all these lovely things and I just loved being with her, but there was no question of her taking me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">But when this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> broke up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wyberley</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burgess Hill</span> , my uncle went, this guardian with me and said, "Look, she can no longer stay in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="881">You could do something." </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And I sat in the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and they argued and she said, "But you promised me that you only needed a signature from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">You told me that I wouldn't have to do anything." </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And he said, "Yes, but I didn't know there was going to be a war, and this thing fell apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">The <span class="BUILDING">home</span> 1s no longer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Somebody's got to take care of her." </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And she said, "But you promised." </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And, you know, she just didn't want to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And so I sat there absolutely stricken with fear, and I hated that they argued about me like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And so I said to myself will they be able to come and ask me what I'm going to do, what I want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And so I will have to tell them quickly, and what can I do that I could earn my living? </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Because my sister was already earning her own living, and I didn't have any skills. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">So I said to myself I will say that I can wash hair because that doesn't require any skills. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">So when they came out and she said to me "Well, what do you want to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="895">What do you want to do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And I said, "I can be a hairdresser; I can wash hair." </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And she said no, or my uncle said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">In any case, they came to some arrangement where he begged her to send me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And she said, okay, she would do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">She finally agreed to it after a long argument, and she said, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">they agreed that he would go to Bexley (ph) College to talk to them to see whether they would take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Because I didn't speak English really. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And she said, "Okay, I will pay for the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And my uncle said, "She can stay with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I'll put her up until she learns to short and type." </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And so my uncle whose wife had been evacuated with the baby to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And he said he would be able to take me until I'm out of -- as long as I'm in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">So my guardian said, okay, she will pay for the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and as far as I remember, she said she would pay him maintenance for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And she would give me five shillings pocket money a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And so my uncle went to the headmaster of Bexley (ph) College, and begged him to take me because the headmaster said, "I can't take her to , She doesn't speak English." </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And he begged him, he said, "You must give her a try because this is her only chance, because this lady is willing to pay for her education." </span><span class="sentence" id="912">So the headmaster said, "Okay, I'll try it." </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And, of course, I felt absolutely obligated to try to get out of there as fast as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">It was a two- or three-year college. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I was out of there in 10 months, and I got a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And then I had to move from my uncle's to the same <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that my older sister lived in that <span class="BUILDING">girl's home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And I went -- the headmaster complained to my uncle that I was not socializing with other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">When I -- during recess, I was always sitting at my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> working. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I had to because I could learn children only phonetically because I don't understand the words they were saying, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">But he kept me, and I graduated in 10 months with -- I would have preferred to stay there longer because my skills would have been better, but I was able to type and I was able to take shorthand, even though I didn't understand what I was taking. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And when I got my first job at the <span class="BUILDING">book shop</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Paul's</span> , I earned I think one pound five shillings a week and -- two pounds, five shillings. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And with that money, I immediately got into the <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> where my sister was, and I paid all my money there, to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And that was the extent of my education. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">From there -- my guardian was always looked after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I mean, she was good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">She always invited me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Oh, when she finally argued and decided to send me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to show him that she is not ungenerous, she took me out and bought me a coat and a few things. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And she gave me this pocket money every week, and she would invite me very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">I believe she loved me and I loved her, but that's all she could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">You know, she just didn't know how to do anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And she would invite me to spend weekends with her sometimes, and she had a huge family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And none of them every thought of including me in anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">They had children my age or younger, but this was a Jewish family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and they did not want me in this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="934">QUESTION:  What did you make of this at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">ANSWER:  Felt very -- I felt it was unkind. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Unkind. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">I felt -- they had birthday parties going for little children, for children -- I was never included in anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">They didn't -- but now when I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , they try to make a big fuss of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">But in those days, they didn't think of doing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">But it destroyed many Jewish families that they did not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="941">QUESTION:  Could you accept your guardian's limits?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="942">ANSWER:  Yes, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Because she was truly loving and she -- oh, one thing I must mention in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">For as long as she lived afterwards whenever we saw each other, whenever she was in any company at all, she would tell the story that I wanted -- "she wanted to be a hairdresser, but I saved her from this." </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Well, I let her go on telling that story until towards the very end of her life when I was with nieces and nephews, all those fancy nieces and nephews, I mean, hew nephew had invited me to dinner one day when I was older and attractive and he was a young officer in the British Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">When he invited me to dinner, it would be at the <span class="BUILDING">Savoy Hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="947">You know, the fanciest <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="948">In any case, I told him when I saw them the last time, I said, "Your aunt always told you that I wanted to be a hairdresser. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">That was her story." </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And I told him the story that 1t wasn't because I wanted to be a hairdresser, but because I didn't want her to feel that she should be having to pay for me, because I needed to earn my own living. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">So that was the story about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="952">QUESTION:  They didn't teach you English at the first <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="953">ANSWER:  Yes, they did, but it was not sufficient to be able to take -- I mean, it was basic English. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I mean, the first words in English that I learned, I needed to learn words that would take care of my sister, my little sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Because my little sister was not very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">She was -- what do I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Not sickly, not really sickly, but she was the baby at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , she was spoiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And she was frail, that's the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Frail. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And I said I must learn to tell people that she is not well, but I didn't know how to say it. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">So I would learn -- the first thing I learned was to say, "My sister has a headache." </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Those were my first English words. "</span><span class="sentence" id="963">My sister has a headache." </span><span class="sentence" id="964">That's all I needed to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And when we were dispersed from this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I had saved 15 shillings. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Do you know how much that is? </span><span class="sentence" id="967">15 shillings, it was about $3. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And when we were dispersed, I gave her my $3 because I said I will be able to take care of myself, but she needed -- I wanted to do everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">You see, when she was born, I was very envious of the fact there was a baby in the family, and so I always had a sort of slight guilt feeling that I wanted to get her out of her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> , because she displaced me from parents' bedroom when I was a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I used to sleep in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , but when she was born, I had to get out because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> had to come in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">So I always resented that part, so I always felt that I had to make up for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">Because I felt if something happened, that was my fault, because of my bad thoughts, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">So I would give up all the money, all the money I had so that she would -- because I needed to have the peace of mind that I've done everything for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">So I learned to say, "My sister has a headache." </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And I gave her all my pocket money, so that the result of my parents' teaching, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">Because my mother always wrote in every letter "The main thing is that you should get along with each other, and you've got to love each other and you have to get along with each other." </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And so I -- and another thing, whenever I did anything at all, it was always a question in my mind was 1s that what they would want me to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">So we all behaved better than we would have done had we lived with our parents, because we always lived by the standard that we want more than -- I mean, we were -- I, particularly, was totally exaggerated. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">The only <span class="REGION">area</span> where I didn't follow is in the religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I did not follow my father's footsteps because I thought I was so -- and to me this whole disaster was incomprehensible, so I did not- that's one justice -- I feel I'm perfectly justified not to have followed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">So, otherwise, we did everything what my mother -- you know, I did everything for my sisters afterwards because I, no matter what they did -- I mean, they always were good. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">We were always good. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">But I took it upon myself to be the -- I mean, I just did not argue about anything with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">I just gave in. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">I mean, I won't say that I was absolutely like that when I was a young girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">My older sister was the one who took care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">I did go through her drawers and I borrowed her blouses, and I used -- and I made her do my mending for me and do all kinds of stuff, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="989">Oh, we had do our own mending and, you know, we had to darn our socks and darn our -- I mean, that's the kind of -- in the last year my mother taught us all these things, to do all these things before we left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="990">QUESTION:  Well, it must have been tough when you left that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that you had to separate from your sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="991">ANSWER:  Yeah, we all separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">But my older sister was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , so she was in that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And I was not too far from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">I was with my uncle, and my uncle was -- we were very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">I was very close to my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">He was particularly attached to me, so...
QUESTION:  So you visited with your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="997">ANSWER:  My younger sister suffered greatly because she was away from us and she felt isolated, and also she felt that my older sister and I were very close and she was out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">But we tried to look after her as best we could, but she felt very -- for the rest of her life, she felt lonely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">QUESTION:  Did you -- so you saw your older sister regularly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1000">ANSWER:  Yeah, I saw her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1001">QUESTION:  And the other sister, did you visit her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1002">ANSWER:  Only when -- no, we never visited her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">During holidays, she would visit us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And then she stayed there until she finished her <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">I think until she got her first job, as far as I -- my older sister and I then moved together to the <span class="BUILDING">YWCA</span> , which was like a <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">It was like run my matron, and the meals were served there, breakfast and dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And we stayed there five years until we had to leave because the maximum that you could stay there was five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">So until we had to leave, we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I worked for about a year for this <span class="BUILDING">book shop</span> , where I earned the minimum, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Then I got a job with my guardian, had a friend who was some kind of chemical engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And he did some effort work, and I transferred to work for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">And then I got a wonderful job with the Czech Armament, as a bilingual secretary, and...
QUESTION:  This was during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1013">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">I think I started working with them in 1943 or '44, and I stayed with them until I came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">I came here with my job, actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1016">QUESTION:  When you worked with the Czech government, did you get a lot of information about what was going on in the world?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1017">ANSWER:  I mean -- I didn't know what -- we didn't get any information as the result of working with the Czech Armament where I was, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1018">QUESTION:  Were you still getting letters from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1019">ANSWER:  No, 1942, March 1942 was the last letter from my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And they were deported in June 1942 to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And my grandmother -- and I don't know what happened to my grandfather and his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">My uncle wrote a little note to us, and he said he was deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but I think he was killed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Because there is -- when we were visiting <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> a few years later after the war, we went to this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , where we used to go as children to pick wild strawberries and snowdrops, and there's a monument to people who had to dig their own <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And there's a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And I didn't dare to ask the man who took us there who is buried in that <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> , but I suspect my grandfather is buried in that <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">But I just was too frightened to ask him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">I didn't want to -- I mean, I did and I didn't want to know, but I should have liked to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">That's one thing I didn't investigate, what happened to my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">I know what happened to my parents and to my grandmother, but I don't know what happened to him.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1141">ANSWER:  I'm sure I had dreams, and I kept the diary in my -- in the <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> mainly for the purpose of having it for my parents when I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">That was the idea of the diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">I really didn't keep it for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">I wanted them to know everything we did and how we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And then when war broke out and everything was -- we stopped correspondence, then I stopped keeping the diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">And as I say it's very hard to accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">I always thought I would go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because I don't think it would have true in the end having lived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> during the war and all these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I don't know that I would ever have adjusted to life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> again, but in my mind it was special.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1149">QUESTION:  So you stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">You eventually developed a good career for yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1151">ANSWER:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">Well, I worked for the Czech government in exile until 1947, '48. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">In 1947 I was assigned to work for the second annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund, which was being held in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And I was assigned there to work there by someone who had worked in the Czech government in exile and who went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> immediately after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">He was a high official at the ministry where I worked, and he was -- they all went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> as soon as the war ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">These were big government officials, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">The lesser people like I stayed behind and the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> continued in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">Now, this friend of mine who was quite a high official in the government who was in the ministry of finance in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , and he's the one who insisted that I go to work for the annual meeting for the International Monetary Fund. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Because this time I was an accomplished bilingual secretary and the delegation was coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and they needed someone to work with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">There were 15 members of the delegation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">I was very young and not very experienced, and I was terrified and I didn't want to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">But this man insisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">He didn't get in touch with me, but called my supervisors and insisted that I be assigned to cover this conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And I didn't want to do it, and he insisted and finally I was made to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And this is how I ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> because the people where I worked asked me whether I want to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> with the International Monetary Fund, and this is how I ended up finally getting here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">I was offered the job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and I came with the fund. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">It was very -- 1t worked beautifully because immediately after the annual meeting of the International Management Fund in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , I got a recall letter from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , because the Communists have taken over by this time or shortly after the annual meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">The Communists took over in March 1948 in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and immediately they recalled all of the people who were working for the Czech government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And I was recalled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , and I left my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in the morning to look for another job and that same day, I received a letter of appointment with the International Monetary Fund. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">So I accepted this job for a year, but I worked with them for 35 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">So I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1172">QUESTION:  You know, there is something that we didn't mention.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1173">ANSWER:  What?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1174">QUESTION:  Which was your knowledge when the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">What you were feeling at that time, how did you learn the war was over, because that's a pretty important. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1176">ANSWER:  I tried very hard to reconstruct that memory, but, you know, I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">You know why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">Because I think we were so terrified about will we find out, that I just don't remember exactly how I found out or where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">I don't remember anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">I remember that the war was over everywhere, absolutely scared to find out what happened to the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">But, of course, we immediately sent cables to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to ask about our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">And we had responses, lots of responses from different -- because we sent cables to different people asking them to find, to see to our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And we had responses to say that they were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in June 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">So the last letter that we have from my parents is dated March 1942, and three months later, they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">So at that point, we decided that my sister would go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">I was too petrified to go back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1187">QUESTION:  So you knew that the war was kind of a mixed...
ANSWER:  Yes, it was very scary; it was very frightening because, first of all, we didn't know what we'll find. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">And then by this time, we didn't know where we would go, what we would do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">So my sister traveled back by herself, found nothing, nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">She came back and then this was this decision what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">We decided, well, what to do, we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">We certainly weren't going to go back to nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And so we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and that's when I decided to accept that appointment when I was recalled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , because I didn't want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">Besides, the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> had fallen to Communism, and I didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">And I decided I must get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> because I must accept the appointment for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , because if I didn't get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , we would probably still be living together, my sister and I. And my older sister would not get married until all of us were sort of taken care of, so I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">And as soon as I left, my sister got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">And...
QUESTION:  Your younger sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1198">ANSWER:  My younger sister got married shortly afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">Came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And I stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but I must tell you I did go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> in 1970 for the first time to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">It was shortly after the Communists -- the Communists were still there, but 1t was shortly after Deutsch-Czech (ph) government started making -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> -- you know, there was this revolt against the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">I did go back; I wanted to go back, I wanted to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> because all my life there was something that was bothering me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">I did not really settle down, neither in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> nor <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , even when I was married and had three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">Something bothered me very much, and I couldn't quite put my finger on it but I never felt really at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">So finally we decided we would go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">We were going to go during the Deutsch-Czech (ph), before the Communists took -- but then I got cold feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">But my husband insisted that we do go back, and so we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">We rented a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , we drove to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">We got to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> at 6 o'clock in the evening, and it was totally changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">Totally changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">There were huge <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">I mean, it was under the Communist regime, they built these huge concrete <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was so transformed, I could not find my way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">In any case, I said to my husband if we go -- the first thing I did when we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> -- it was 6 o'clock in the evening -- I asked the people about my friend, Eva . </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">I didn't ask for any of the Jewish children, because there was no one left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">But I asked for my friend; they said, "Oh, she just died about a year ago." </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">So I was very disappointed because she the only person I could think of to ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And then I said to my husband, "The only way I can find my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> if I go to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> where I used to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and then walk that <span class="DLF">street</span> down that <span class="DLF">street</span> , I'll know where my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> 1s." </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And when we got there, there was this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that looked so dilapidated and all the children were playing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and I said to them, "Do you live in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">And they said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">I said, "Could you ask your mother whether I could come in, I used to live here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">And she said, "Well, there are three families living 1n this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> now, " but she said, "you can go on." </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">I said, "No, go in and ask her whether I could come in." </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And so she went in and I followed her, and she called up to her mother that somebody wants to come in and see the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">The mother came to the top of the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , she looked down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">She then knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> where her husband was taking a cap, and she said, "Come out, Mrs. Ebostarkova is here." </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">And I was shocked, absolutely, that she should say that after 40 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">And I said, "How did you know who I was?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">And she said, "Well, who else could it be?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">So they knew that they were living in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that belonged to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">And I looked, I couldn't recognize one stick of anything that belonged to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And they immediately assembled their -- some of the other people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to come and see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">That's when I got this book with the photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">And they all wanted to buy the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from me, and I said, "Well, I don't -- this is not my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">I mean, I don't want to deal with it." </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">And so the next morning -- one of them invited us to spend the night and we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">He was the son of a woman who used to clean the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">And he said to me, "I remember your grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">He used to wear this gold chain," and he pointed out and he made out as if the chain were several inches wide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And he said, "We used to play together," but I couldn't remember him anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">And then he insisted on taking me the next morning to the <span class="BUILDING">district building</span> to see whether we could transfer the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to him, whether they could buy the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">And when we got -- I didn't want to do it, but I went with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And when we got there, this woman who was keeping the books looked up to see whether any taxes are owed on the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and then she said to me, "If you decide to sell the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , will you sell it to me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">I said, "I'm not selling anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">I'm not staying." </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">In any case, at 10 o'clock, I said to my husband, "I've got to get out of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">I've got to get out of here." </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">So we took a little walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">We went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> where I used to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">That's when I saw that big <span class="DLF">grave</span> and the monument to the people, and then we got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">I said, "We've got to get out of here, and don't stop." </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">We got there at 6 o'clock in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">At 10 o'clock in the morning, we were on our way out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">And we drove fast to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , as fast as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">And we almost got shot by the border guards because my husband didn't realize that somebody was trying to stop us, because somebody was flashing a lantern. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">He thought it was a bicyclist, and it was the border guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">But I was so ill in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">back seat</span> , I was sick all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">I was so ill on my journey <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I said to him -- I just lay there being sick all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">I said, "Don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">Just get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and get the best <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">I need to get into the best <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">You just get there as fast as you can." </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">So we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> at whatever time it was, 11 o'clock at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , the best <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> he could find. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">I went upstairs and I lay down and slept, and they went out -- my son and Peter went out to dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">And I just slept and slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Woke up the next morning and just relaxed, and then I realized that this was the best thing that ever happened to me, that I went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">I made my final journey <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my return journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">That's what I was waiting for all these years, to make the return journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">Because I lived out of my suitcases, and I didn't realize that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">For all those years, even when I had -- until 1970, I lived into my suitcases. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">And then we -- I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and it was the best thing that could have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">When I drove to work through <span class="DLF">Rock Creek Park</span> , I used to work -- before that, I used to drive to work through <span class="DLF">Rock Creek Park</span> , and I used to say to myself almost every day, "This is very pretty, but it is not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">There are no snowdrops here and no wild flowers." </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">And I missed it so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">And then I came back from that trip; I drove through <span class="DLF">Rock Creek Park</span> and I said, "Well, strawberries and snowdrops are not everything." </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">And I was just -- suddenly, I realized that this is what was bothering me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">I just had to make the trip back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">And even though I stayed there from 6:00 in the evening until 10:00 in the morning, it did it for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">And I said, "I don't want to sell the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">Just take it, do whatever you like, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">I don't want to deal with the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">Which I felt a little ashamed because my father put everything -- you know, he wanted us to have this, but I had to leave it behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">I can't deal with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And that's when they told me about all the -- I mean, you know, nobody returned anything when my sister went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">And when you think about what actually happened was that people were just greedy, and they wanted -- that was about the material things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">They wanted to take the things away from the people, from the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">That gave them the license to take things away and to even kill, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">I mean, they put people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and they didn't care what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">But they were able to get into their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and take the property away, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">That's all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1292">QUESTION:  Do you remember your impressions when you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1293">ANSWER:  I loved being 1n the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">I mean, I felt at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> here right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">I told you I felt at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , much more so than I did in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> because I felt this was sort of everybody belonged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">And, you know, we all belonged here, just very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">In <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , it's different now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">I think it's better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">And I feel very much at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> when I go back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">I feel very comfortable, but in those days, it was very hard for refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">But although <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was, I must say, I must give credit where credit is due, they did take 10,000; whereas, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , they didn't take very many children, if any. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">Altogether they took very few refugees, whereas <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on this small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , did take a lot -- I mean, there were 10,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">And many of the people who took the children, many of the families were not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Most of the children that were assigned to families were assigned to non-Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Many of the Jewish families gave money, but did not give <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">So -- except in the transport.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1307">QUESTION:  You came here, you got married and had a family?</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, but there is an ethic in the way we were brought up, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">It's not only going to -- I still maintain that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">I live like that, I brought my children up that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">They are Jewish and they know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">And they are decent people; that's all I can say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">I mean, one doesn't have to go -- I find that all the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in all the things did not help to make these people good, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">That doesn't make people good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">They have to be good from <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">That's what goodness is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">Praying, going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and then going to confession, and doing evil things 1s not the fact -- that's the difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1340">QUESTION:  How do you think growing up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> shaped the person you became?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1341">ANSWER:  Well, how? </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">It was -- growing up in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , actually, I grew up among refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">I told you, except for my guardian, I didn't know -- I don't think I knew any English people beside my guardian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">But I have to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">Maybe in the <span class="BUILDING">YWCA</span> where I lived, I met some, but we did not maintain any kind of relationships. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">More <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> gave me a lot of -- did build some character. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">I mean, they behaved so beautifully during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">They were so solidly, you know, brave, and they continued to work, even when the bombs were falling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">And they were just strong, steady people, and that, I think, helped a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">I mean, it taught me a lot, I learned a lot in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">And I think they are so disciplined and truthful in <span class="DLF">lines</span> for everything and very decent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1352">QUESTION:  How -- have you thought about how these extremes in your unusual childhood impacted you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">What sorts of long-term effects this has had on you or the way you lived, the way you raised your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1354">ANSWER:  My childhood, well, 1t was difficult because, of course, I didn't have parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">During the most crucial time of my life when I was growing up in my teens, I didn't have anyone to show me anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">So I always felt a little doubt whether I never knew exactly what to do when I had a baby, or how to dress the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">And certain things, I didn't have a mother to show me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">I had to learn myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">I just observed and I took the best out of what I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">I mean, I missed a lot of that not having the guidance from my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">But also, I mean, it forced me to make some decisions about myself and how I wanted to do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">And I don't know how it would have been if I had gone back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my parents would have been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">I don't know how that my life would been, it's a big question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1365">QUESTION:  But you think that affected the way you raised your own children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1366">ANSWER:  Oh, if affected -- well, I'm sure that I -- yes, I didn't do that greatly in raising my children because I was a very anxious mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">And I'm sure that my experiences definitely had an impact on my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">I'm sure I damaged my children a great deal through this kind of anxiety because I worried about them a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">I was always terrified something would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">Of course, I see only the -- I'm always fearful about things happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">And I used to feel very sorry for my children when they were babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">I used to stand over the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> and I used to say, "You poor little baby, you don't know you're Jewish, what you have to face in life." </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">And I felt terrible for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">Maybe they saw the feelings that I felt when I didn't allow myself to feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">I transmitted, I felt that they were my kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">I felt very sorry for them when they were little ones, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">I said, "You don't what lies ahead, how horrible." </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">Its' so hard, but I still didn't do anything to change that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">But I did feel sorry, I mean, definitely my children have -- are the product of my experiences, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">My husband's too, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">Except my husband, of course, came out with his mother and his sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1382">QUESTION:  Do you have certain fears or anxieties today that are...
ANSWER:  Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">Always have fears.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1384">QUESTION:  ... from that period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1385">ANSWER:  Yes, I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">I live in fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">I live in fear, but I manage -- to have a husband who is an optimist and so we have a balance, but I'm very anxious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">He always said that I was afraid of authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">I'm afraid of police when I see a policeman, and I'm afraid of this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">And he attributes many more fears to me probably than I have, but maybe not quite enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">I think I have a great deal more fears, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">But I deal with it, I mean, the best I know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">I manage to hide it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1394">QUESTION:  Is there any other thoughts you have or anything else you want to say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1395">ANSWER:  Well, I can say -- I didn't say anything about Mr. Winton, but Mr. Winton will speak for himself as the gentleman who arranged for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">I do want to say another thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">Yes, I do want to say something which is very, very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">That I'll never -- that I'm very grateful to my uncle because who has an uncle like mine? </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">And I'm very, very grateful to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">I mean, who would have thought that parents like mine who lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , who have never been out of it, who would have done this, sent us out? </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">And I do not, like some people feel angry with their parents for having sent them away, I never for one moment had those feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">And I don't think any of -- maybe my younger sister may have, but I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">Maybe she did feel that way, but I always felt very grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">And I am amazed, absolutely amazed, that my parents had the courage to do it because they suffered incredibly for having sent the children away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">My mother's letters are heartbreaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">That's why I can't read them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">As soon as I begin to read the letters, I can't continue because she is so devastated by having sent us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">But there is another good thing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">My father had a -- when I wrote to my parents in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , I would say -- I was always afraid that my father would be the one who would be taken away, so I wrote to my parents and I said to them, "I want my father" -- my mother was the one who wrote the letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">My father always added something; not always, but sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">And I would say to my mother through the letters, "Be sure that my father signs his name to every letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">I want to know that he's there, and don't tell me he's all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">I want to see his signature on every letter." </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">And he wrote, and one of the last letters that he wrote was "I'm so glad you're not here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">I'm so glad that you're there, that we sent you away." </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">And that was the best letter that we ever had because I thought at last, because at the beginning they doubts whether they did the right thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">And, of course, you know, I mean, how -- I just marvel at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">That's all I can tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">Because I have my own children, and I don't know that I would ever be able to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">And that shows you that this was enormous love to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">What a sacrifice! </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">So that's what I have to add. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">There are masses of other things that probably I have forgotten, but, you know, I could go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">I did a tape -- my younger sister died a year ago, very suddenly, from cancer of the lung caused by asbestos. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">Apparently, it had to with my father's business because he was in the asbestos -- in the roofing business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">I mean, <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and roofing, and he did asbestos tiles for the <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">Now, when my sister died, she may have had other memories that I'm sorry I didn't get to ask her, but her daughter asked me to tell the story of her mother and of our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">Because her daughter wants to do a book, so I finally did, I did that for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">I did a tape which is a four-hour tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">The story, of course, as I went on, I remembered many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">And to this moment, I still keep on remembering other things which I add to the tape, so the tape exists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">But I'm sure that I have forgotten or left out things, but there is only so much one can say, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">Now, I'd like to show you my two sisters, 1f I may.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1435">QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">Are we going to need to stop?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1437">ANSWER:  This picture was taken probably in 1940 or '41 and sent to us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">And on the left, from the left to right, my mother; my mother's sister, Marguerite (ph); my grandmother, my step grandmother, actually; my grandfather with a moustache; and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">And they were all sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">This is the three of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">My older sister, Josie, in the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">I'm in the middle, Alice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">And my younger sister, Ellie, who was 10 years old, the little one on the left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1444">QUESTION:  When was this taken?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1445">ANSWER:  This was taken shortly before we came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">This is my father's mother who came to stay with my parents, I think probably after we left sometime at the end of 1939 after <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was occupied, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">After war broke out, and she came from to stay with my parents, and this is one reason why my parents could not leave, even if they wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">Because they wouldn't desert her, and she went with them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in the summer 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">This is the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived from 1938 until 1939, or at least we children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">My parents stayed down till 1942, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">This is the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , where I lived until I was 14 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">None of the people who -- none of my friends, none of the Jewish families survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">Oh, possibly one may have survived, but none of the ones that we were very close to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1455">QUESTION:  How many Jews lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1456">ANSWER:  I'm not sure how many, but quite a few families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">Maybe 20 Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">Okay, this is about two weeks prior to our departure from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">And I'm in the middle with a basket with my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> celebrating some occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">I can't remember what it was, but this was a national costume that we were wearing, and we had a great time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">Okay, this 1s the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> which this 1s what it looked like in 1970 when I made my first trip back to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1462">QUESTION:  Is it being used as a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ?</span></p>
