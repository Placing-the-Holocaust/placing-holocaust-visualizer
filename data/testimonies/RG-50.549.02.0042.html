ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Now, before we continue, I would like you to -- I would like to wish you a belated but happy birthday.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  I think it’s close enough, today’s the 16th, so that was only four days ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  The core of our interview today, will deal with the time after liberation, up to the present day, but I thought it would be helpful for us to go back a little -- a little bit, to the year 1944, to clear -- to clear up a few events that you talked about in the videotaped interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">In 1944, you and your family -- your immediate family were put on a transport from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starahovichen</span> , it’s in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  And at that time, your youngest sister was not with you any more, because she had already been taken away during a raid 1n an earlier <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And your parents decided -- that’s what you said in the earlier interview, your parents decided that your father should stay together with your older brother and your mother should stay with you and your older sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  That is correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  And the hope was that it might be possible for your father and your se -- your brother to flee, but that hope did not come about. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So, what haven -- what happened when you arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">What -- What do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  The -- The time when we were brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was the height of the transports from all over <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And they -- the ovens were working full capacity to process all these people that were coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And so that we happened to have been in a holding pattern, not given the numbers on arrival, as inmates of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had [indecipherable] for some week or -- or so, we were held - kept, to be processed -- in other words, to be taken to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">But somehow, we ended up getting the inmates numbers tattooed and processed as inmates of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="21">All I know is that we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in December, somewhere around July, I believe, and not very much later, the time of the Jewish holidays -- the Jewish New Year would fall som -- at about September, when, on the first or second day, rather, of the Jewish New Year, the selection was conducted 1-1n the men’s section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And there they took away all the youngsters and of course, disabled people and old men who could not work and my brother was taken away at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I became aware of it through my mother, who had gotten word of it through other people that had seen my father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  You did mention earlier that you did eventually get a number. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Would you tell us your number?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  Yes, my number is 7671, was preceded by the letter B. No, it is actually 7871. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">It 1s tattooed with a instrument like a pen and ink and it does not -- I never wash this off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">You stayed with your mother and your sister in the <span class="DLF">women’s block</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  I’m trying to recall whether I stayed actually with my mother for long, because I know that I ended up with youngsters even younger than myself, including some Russian children that were separated from their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And there were children and even babies, including babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Now, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , Dr. Mengele was conducting experiments and that may have been one of the reasons that one of the -- the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was filled with youngsters that did actually not work, per se, but maybe were kept for other reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And I was one of -- one of those kids that was kept at the children’s barracks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  In the earlier videotape, you also mention that you worked as a messenger at one point. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">How did that come about and what exactly did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  My recollection is that before coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , one of the friends of my father had made this arrangement that it would be important that I should be shown to be useful to the German commander of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> if I was to be like a messenger boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And in some way, I was also found to be doing that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But it was not a job that you -- that you perform, it was -- that kapos or whatever, whoever was in charge, would need somebody to carry a message or a note, whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  Did you have any -- Do you have any recollections of -- of interacting with the children in the <span class="BUILDING">children’s barrack</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I mean the -- obviously it was not a place to -- to socialize in any way, but what -- do you remember any particular relationships?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  I cannot recollect as being able to do much socializing, besides -- with the other children that were in that <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It’s difficult for me to recollect what -- how we really- the day -- from morning til night, how we spent our time, whether it was going out with the working people and being around to be sent on errands or other -- in other ways, kept busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">That’s maybe why there was no social interaction with other children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you -- what you were given to eat? </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Do you remember’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  To the best of my recollection, it’s -- on -- in the morning, we were given a brew that was like a tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">It was, if I’m not mistaken, no breakfast, no -- no bread, only at lunchtime, we may have had a slice of bread in the soup and in the evening, two slices of bread, maybe a soup, also.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Were you able to see your mother and your sister after a certain point? </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Did you see- Did you ever see your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  I was able to see my mother, because I -- I did, in the beginning, I was sleeping in the same <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> as my mother and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">The <span class="BUILDING">children’s barracks</span> , this came about later, when they collected the children into a separate <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My father, I had seen once, when -- on a working assignment, a crew of people had been brought into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women’s section</span> , where they were doing some construction or road improvement, whatever, maybe for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So, I had seen my father once during that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Now, was one incident that you talked about in the videotaped interview, that stands out with particular gravity. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Would you speak about that again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  I assume that the -- the mention of -- in my tape, the -- a mention of --
QUESTION:  [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  I’m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">The mention of the toy [indecipherable] by a kapo, when she wanted to hand me a toy and I refused it, because I knew at the time that my older brother had been taken away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  That kapo played an even larger role there. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Could you speak a little bit about that, too? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">She gave you food, but she also requested things from you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  The -- I was only going on nine at the time, and the memory of the extra food was the one that was outlasting the other experience, even though a Freudian doctor might make a big deal of -- more of a big deal about that -- the influence of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">To me, the- to me, the extra meal was the life sustaining part and -- and being with the kapo and seeing her, having a, so to speak, own possessions of -- a side <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> like, a -- a flower - around <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flower table</span> that had -- was covered with a -- a tablecloth and on the lower shelf she kept some extra food, bread and a piece of salami and she would offer me an extra meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">That’s what was, to me, the -- the most important part of the memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  And she also molested you 1n the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  In retrospect, I -- I’m -- when I recall the experiences, when she took me to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , the few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">What a -- That is typical of a -- a so-called pedophile or child molester or a person desperate for a male companionship, I cannot tell the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But she was not actually forcing herself on me, just being playful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Ho-How did you feel when that happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Did you know what she was asking, ultimately?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Actually, I was not fully conscious of -- I didn’t really know the implications of it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">All I know 1s that I was more attracted to the girl that was washing me and fondling my private parts than to the woman who took me to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Do you know anything about her? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Do you know her name, her nationality, her --
ANSWER:  Unfortunately I don’t, and -- whether she was Jewish or Polish, I’m not sure, but there’s -- someone had told me that she survived the war, but nobody -- just -- by -- by now I am sure that she 1s not alive, because I was -- I was eight or nine years old, but that woman must have been in her 40’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  What language did you speak together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  I do believe that we spoke in Polish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  What -- What do you remember about the last days or the time before liberation happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Do you remember your -- how -- how you -- in what kind of physical condition you were? </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Was there anything that -- that prepared you for things to come? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  At the later part, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I had lost contact with that woman, or rather, she must have been sent away, onto another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So I was more emaciated when the Russians arrived, and the only preparation for a big change was that when I -- it was one of the children or someone who’d urged me on to hide in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> of the sick children and not to join the march -- the evacuation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And that was about three days before the first Russians arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">As I mentioned in the previous tape, the -- the first Russians, they were haggard and themselves hungry and looking for what was in the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and I[ ha -- in the -- what food or clothing the Germans may have left in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  Did they provide any medical assistance, so instead of giving you food, they were asking you to help them find food, in a sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Well, it’s -- was the first two soldiers who arrived, first two foot soldiers, but after they liberated, the Russians moved in in force. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">They did -- Or behind them, the civilian administration and aid organizations helped organize the evacuation of the children and where possible, to reunite them with their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">There were some children so little that they didn’t even know their names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Do you remember the moment when you realized that you were free -- at least free to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="89">That -- And what did you do, what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Unfortunately, it didn’t happen that way, that the first two Russian soldiers coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> instead of hugging and kissing them, and feeling free, one said to the other the word, Evrai, which was like a bad way of saying a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And it was -- it stung me as being no different than the German soldiers before them, so that myself and two other boys, we ran away to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  So you walked?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  How long did it take you, do you have any recollections? [</span><span class="sentence" id="95">indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Even -- Even though it was -- it -- 1t was a harsh winter, 1945, and this being in the beginning of January, but I -- I was so asteeled to bad weather, to cold, and to a lot of- exposed to a lot of things, that I did manage to get to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , whether is was a few kilometers or a few miles, I don’t recall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  And what happened when you got there, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  At first we were taken in by a -- we were separated, I -- I was taken in by a childless couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">The childless couple, they were, during the way -- during the day they were out working, or whatever, and I was like locked in in a type of <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> , one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> type situation, and --
QUESTION:  How did they find you? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Did you knock on a <span class="DLF">door</span> , or did they see you wandering around? </span><span class="sentence" id="100">How -- How did that happen that they took you in? </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  I cannot recall how it happened that this particular couple took me in, but I presume that we did wander in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and that eventually we were led to that couple who had no children. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But staying with that couple turned out to be a big disappointment, being that I had little in common with them and they must have realized themselves, that they cannot make of me a -- a future for that -- 1-1t wouldn’t work unless I went for some schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And that’s how they ended up bringing me to a <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> , where they had peep -- orphans and a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- and a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- in that <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> they had a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  While you were with those two people, how did they treat you though? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I mean, they locked you up during the day, but did they give you food, did they take care of -- did they give you medical attention?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  I don’t think that they were able to give me medical attention at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It was, for them, also hard times and a matter of survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But I did have food, everything is relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I know that I -- I was not going around at the starvation level that I was living under in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  How long do you estimate, were you with them before you went to the [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  It’s a matter of weeks, because it was not very long from when I got into the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> that a mass funeral was organized in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for all those that were killed in the last minute before the evacuation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and people who could not keep up with the march, they were shot by the <span class="DLF">roadside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Some brutally killed, stabbed and cut, people without limbs. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So that mass funeral, it’s enough for a child to- to have nightmares for the rest of his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But what helped me in that -- on that day [ -- that I met someone who directed me to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> that the children were being taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And I left the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">But the thing about the -- this stay in the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> is amazing to me, because now that -- so many years later, 40 or 50 years later, when I -- I didn’t practice Polish for all these years, but I do have Polish ladies working for me and I was able to recall, in Polish language, the blessings or prayers that I studied at that time, in the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  So you were -- you were attracted by the rituals there? </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Did you have a sense of your Jewish identity then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  [had enough knowledge of my background that I knew -- I knew who my parents were and their names, the names of my sister who survived and of course the sister and the brother who were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And -- But I saw in -- at that time, anything that came across my way, to enhance my knowledge 1s -- was engraved in my memory, whether it was studying in the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> , or later, given the opportunity to read books.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  I think I would like to stop here, this 1s the end of cassette of tape one, side A. End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Abraham Malach. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">This is tape number one, side B. So you went -- you went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and -- and then what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">What -- What -- What was the situation, who else was -- was it just Russian soldiers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp now,</span> or was -- were there others as well? </span><span class="sentence" id="125">What -- What was the situation and what happened to you specifically, when --
ANSWER:  I had -- This was administered by some aid groups from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , that they were feeding and clothing, taking care of the remnants of the children that either were liberated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> proper, or possibly collected from other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , whether hidden or -- children, or what -- what other thing -- whatever means they collected them. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">There was not soldiers per se, and we -- they were fed cafeteria style, that you would walk up to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> and someone would fill your plate. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">In the beginning, was hard to just take the plate and with one -- that you would ask for an extra filling before you went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> to eat, until -- 1t took time for you to adjust that if you ate that one portion, and if you were still hungry, you would -- you could go back and ask for the next portion. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">That lasted some weeks, that we were kept still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and from there they sent us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">That was a major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , where they had better physical conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And they started to get lists of people who survived the war, to be able to match them up with children that were collected in the -- in -- from camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And that’s how, eventually, my mother and my sister found out that I was alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Could you say a little bit more about how you related with -- there were other children, of course, did you -- did you speak about what happened among each other, what -- or did you just stay quiet? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">What -- What -- What sort of -- How did you live in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  Well, there were some children -- or children and the passing of time was -- would consist of inventing games, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">My outstanding recollection from that period 1s that I happened to have had a sort of a suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It was a plastic container that some German soldiers abandoned, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And there was this older girl who knew to read and write, that made with me a deal that I would give her that suitcase in exchange for her teaching me to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And that’s how I got into reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">The first books that I could get hold of was -- happened to be the Polish classical literature, like Kovadis and the trilogy of the Yantadoche.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  So she taught you very quickly, then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, I -- I picked up the alphabet very quickly, very quickly, because before I even attended <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which was a year later, I already was devouring books in Polish that the m -- all the major classical books of Polish literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Of course the Kovadis and -- and -- in original, in Polish and the Yantadoche, I find that it was written in a simple -- in a language that I could understand and not only comprehend, but also, it penetrated my consciousness, that I recall details from those books to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">When- The other day we were -- we were driving in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and some Spanish person had the symbol of the fish on the back of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , on his bumper and I asked this Polish girl, “What is -- Do you know what this 1s?” </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And she didn’t even realize that it comes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovadis</span> , the story of the first Christians, when they were getting together, and -- in secret communications they would -- this was a form of them to identify that they were Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They would draw on -- in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> , the shape of a fish. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So a-anything that I -- I read, or later, in the first years of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it just stayed with me forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  But there was no organized schooling at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Ho-How -- And how long did you stay in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Was it difficult for you to -- to remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  I had no trouble in -- on a -- in my personal experiences, I did not have problems, except children, like everywhere, if you are different, you are going to be picked upon and being Jewish was an easy target for -- for German children to try to scare you, to pick on you, to beat you, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But I was a tough kid and I -- I was not running away, I was not hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So that helped me make friends and [indecipherable] as much as that was, at that level, possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I even belonged to a so-called gang of German kids.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  I didn’t mean it to sound so abstract. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I just wanted to get a feel for whether it was important for you to speak about it, or whether it was more important to go -- to go on now and make a new life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">ANSWER:  I suppose it helped me that I was not treated as something special, that I was thrown into a -- excuse me -- into a society and tried to live as one of the -- of the rest of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Otherwise, 1-i1t would have destroyed me, so I am grateful for -- for that -- that I was not made a -- looked upon as a special case, as being different. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">The same is true also, when I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and -- and studied at the [indecipherable] in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> , when my parents were still living, and meeting and studying with German youngsters, that my past was not discussed. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We went on with life.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  I took an interest in science and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> I was limited to what I could study, so after consider -- I was very practical, knowing that a physicist ends up being a teacher or professor and that is not always fulfilling, so I -- I was drawn into -- to more practical things, like engineering and I ended up studying civil engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And, being young, you’re idealist and you listen to these lectures, you take it to heart, when the introduction into civil engineering was that it’s such a creative type of profession, so I believed in it very much.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="348">QUESTION:  And what did you accomplish then, as an independent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">ANSWER:  It’s more -- In my case, did not end up in a big business because the circumstances here are the [indecipherable] business, it used to be glamorous and it’s -- for very few people ends up being a big business. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It’s more and more complicated -- with time, it became more and more complicated, as far as imports. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Today, it’s only the big -- the biggest survive and almost everything is being imported. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So, I did not build an empire.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  I find that my wife was the disciplinarian, that I was unable. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I wouldn’t have been able to bring myself to punish my children and I find that on my -- myself and my daughter to -- to such a degree that it may be overcompensating, where we will be by- at -- too protective of our children and that can mean -- not only in physically protective, but protective in every sense of the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">We would do anything to make their life more comfortable, even at great sacrifice to of -- of -- on our own part. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I -- I be -- I do believe that this is typical of people like me, that went through traumatic childhood, to want to give their children only the best and to be protective of their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">QUESTION:  What kind of -- What kind of values did you wanted to instill in your children? </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Was there anything important to you that you wanted to pass on, or --
ANSWER:  Education is the -- the key word here, and we did not exactly dictate to them what direction to take in life, what profession to choose, but if asked, we would guide them, try to influence them to -- to be practical, not only study for the sake of study, but also to be practical in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">For instance, when my son became of the age of 13, which 1s the Bar Mitzvah age with us, instead of worrying about a big party and nice trip, I bought for him a computer, which was, at that time still in the infancy stage, the personal computer business. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And I’m proud of that -- that -- to have -- that 1s, guided him into this <span class="DLF">field</span> , and that today there is no -- no profession that will do well without being involved with computers.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="386">ANSWER:  My wife is more respectful of what she was brought up with and traditional, is -- she is more traditional than I am, but she followed through on the fact that religion does not make a person per se, bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Religious upbringing does, in general, make children more respectful of elders, of parents, and of other people -- other people’s feelings in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">But, we didn’t carry it to the extreme of having, for instance, my son having been for eight years in a -- the <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> , that we then put him in a - still a <span class="BUILDING">private high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">But not a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> , in order to be exposed and interact better with not just Jewish children, but to be studying with other children.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  I -- When I’m asked to tell or to talk to young people, I can only emphasize one thing, that the youngsters that have missed opportunities in their early years, whether it was because they were not attentive in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , or whether their parents were not able to afford them a education -- a formal education, that life is not finished at age 20 or wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">That you can always go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and that education is the only means to improve yourself, both -- and as -- enrich your -- as a person and also enable you to reach higher professionally and financially improve your -- your living. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So I -- I -- I emphasize the fact that it’s never too late to pick off your piece -- pieces and start all over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">QUESTION:  Did you speak -- Did you speak to your children about your war experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  They may have seen -- they -- they probably did see the tape -- the audio tape that I did for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , but we have not actually sat down and talked about the experiences and -- and I’m not sure whether they don’t ask me direct -- directly about this because they don’t want to cause me pain, or whatever, that it -- they -- they may feel that it’s painful f -- to -- for me to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I don’t know the reason for it, but they actually did not ask me about it and I -- I think that it is normal and good that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">As youngsters they don’t -- they -- they wouldn’t understand and don’t know any better. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">When they grow up and they go about their -- the business of life, they get to read and to know as much as they need, without having to ask me in person. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And I- | think that they did watch, though, the tape that I made.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  But you -- But you did decide at one point, to speak to school children. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">When -- When did you decide and why did you decide to -- to speak publicly, or in public -- more public situations?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="406">QUESTION:  But they had not asked you because they knew that you were a survivor of the Holocaust, you were supposed to give a speech? </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Or did they know that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  When you -- When you look back on your life, can you say a little bit more about the long term impact that the war experience have had on you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  Well, number one, if 1t wasn’t for the war, I would not have been -- ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but what the impact on me -- wh-what impact it had on me, I can only say that it requires a -- it required a great effort to overcome -- to -- not to suppress the memory, but to pick up the pieces and just get on with your life, to build your life wi - dis -- and disregard and not ma -- let those experiences guide your life or be guided by -- by that, in judging people or influencing your -- your thinking and your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I would rather try to read up on the biographies of people that were involved in the Third Reich, whether it was Albert Speer or whether 1t was Eichmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I would read, “The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,” by Herr Schuyler and so on, just to -- to understand what type of conditions or what motivation these people had to initiate, and put into, and execute these policies. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">But there is no explanation and there I found little of excuses in these people when -- Albert Speer, when he got out of <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and wrote his autobiography and tried to explain that in his education as a professional, and he was an archi -- it’s an architect that he did not have classes in civics and -- and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">An-And I -- I cannot accept that, because I myself educated in technical field. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">That does not mean that you don’t know right from wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">The -- We’re supposed to be the climax, and German culture was the highest form of culture that the world had known at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And if you read Hagerint, you -- you -- you would think that it -- it’s the culmination of western civilization, the German culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And how deeply rooted it was in the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">You -- When you read about the man who was -- I forget his name -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> , was converted as a young man and of course, under the Nazi regime was removed from his post as a professor of German literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">But when he wrote his diaries and how proud he was as a German, how deeply he believed in German culture, that in spite of all that humiliation that he was subjected to, he still believed in the German culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">So, yeah, I -- I do believe that the answer is in education and in communication, but the m -- the more important thing 1s that we live today in a different world. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">In those days, people barely had a radio, no television. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Today, it’s instant co -- in the age of instant communication, where everything 1s instantly shown on television and things have changed so much that I don’t believe that you can propagate this type of hatred and commit atrocities on that scale, without the world seeing and knowing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So that -- that is a big change.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  Are there any particular events in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that have influenced you a lot? </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Political events, cultural movements. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Was there anything, when you came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , that you recognized as either something you didn’t want or that you wanted to emulate, or- it’s a very general question --

<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  No, my -- I -- I -- I think that the reason why <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was as successful -- as successful as it is, is that 1t did absorb people of different cultures and we’re forced to live together and make the best of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">So, it is influenced by many, many streams of ideology and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So, the multicultural living has created a society that can look back on history, but does not -- without looking at others as being inferior. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">The -- I do believe that Eur-Europe had come to that stage where the nationalism had taken over too -- too much of the essential element in their outlook on life. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Whether it was the French that wanted to see everything in French, or in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> that they wanted to be- be a sush -- prove their superiority and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">In <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , you -- you don’t have that propaganda of uniqueness as a nation, or as ara -- as arace. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And I see that as being the big success story.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  I have -- We do have one couple that they -- the woman was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and her husband lived -- he’s also from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but he lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And there’s an -- another couple where the husband, he was -- he survived as an orphan in- in, I believe in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">So, it is somehow, now that I’m talking about it, it does sound strange, we never exchanged much discussion or went into details of where we were during the war, how we survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">We never went into these details.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  Do you think that, in spite of the differing experiences among survivors, that there are certain commonalities that they might share?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  Probably in the outlook on life and on -- in their behavior, I -- I’m sure of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">One of the things that I mentioned 1s 1n the way they -- th-they are so protective of their children, and that they will be very careful to -- to see that their children study in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , get an education.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">QUESTION:  Do you think that people hearing your stories can really understand what -- what you are -- what you are telling them of it? </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Do you think they are really listening, or are there also a lot of preconceptions entering into this? </span><span class="sentence" id="467">How do you -- How do you feel about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="468">It’s kind of listening and telling situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">ANSWER:  I do think that most people, including myself, cannot conceive of a situation that I went through is possible in our day and age. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So -- However, they -- there are a lot of people who -- who want to make sure that their children know about it, that it be -- talked about it, to make sure that this type of situation does not happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And that’s why it is becoming a topic of discussion and being taught in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> as a -- a course of study, the -- the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  This is the end of tape two, side B. End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Abraham Malach. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">This 1s tape number three, side A. I would like to follow up on what you have just said. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Some people would say that, over the last 20 years, the Holocaust has become sort of a focal point of Jewish identity -- of American Jewish identity and they question that that is a very positive development. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Has it become too much of -- of a central focus? </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Do you -- Whether it is to the detriment of other aspects of -- of Jewish culture?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  I don’t think it is to the detriment. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">In talking out about it, it is something -- I see it as a positive development when I -- what comes to my mind 1s the situation that was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> and at the time when Elie Wiesel was present -- in the presence of the president, spoke out, “Mr. President, do something about <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> did not want to get involved militarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Conveniently, also so because the Europeans were standing back and it was in their [indecipherable] and they should have been the ones who should have taken the position immediately, taken a stand and they were not doing it, and were watching how a beautiful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> - <span class="COUNTRY">Herzegovina</span> , the -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> -- city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sarajevo</span> was being bombarded and shelled and atrocities being committed. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So Elie Wiesel stepped out and asked the president, please, do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So these type of pleas and -- can have only an effect, when the story has been publicized and made known. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">What is the most effective way? </span><span class="sentence" id="484">That’s a different question. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I do believe that a movie like Schindler’s List, or the -- the play Anna Frank, are very, very effective. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And that it is important to tell the story, is -- to me, it is evident that when it c-came out that ak -- atrocities were being committed in <span class="COUNTRY">Croatia</span> -- in -- I’m -- I’m sorry, in <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> , of ethnic cleansing, and you had people say, “Well, it is not for Americans to get involved because over there this hatred has existed and will continue for -- it -- 1t wa -- it lasted for centuries and it will continue for centuries and there’s nothing we can do, we should stay away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I think that is wrong, and I was happy to see that the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> took the lead in opposing the -- this ethnic cleansing in <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">QUESTION:  Should that happen every time there’s an -- an ethnic war going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="489">There was <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> , there were other incidents, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Do you feel strongly that that should happen every time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">ANSWER:  Well, what form the intervention should take, I -- I’m -- I don’t know, I’m no expert, but that -- there should be -- this should not be allowed, ethnic clean -- let’s me put it this way, that it should not be allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">To me that 1s clear and why <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> should be involved? </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Because <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> 1s the dominant <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and without the American leadership, it seems that nothing is really happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">But they should be more forceful in getting the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> involved, like they managed to do in <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> , that they got the French, incidentally the Germans too, to tell them, “Listen, it’s time that you take your responsibilities also.” </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And they -- they have 19 NATO countries involved in that endeavor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">QUESTION:  Which events in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> had a special effect on you, for whatever reasons, over the years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  Well, number one, going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> as a youngster and not being taunted as a Jew, it had the -- the greatest effect on me and I don’t know whether it is for every youngster the best period in his life, the teenage years, but for me it certainly was the greatest time in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">The spirit of a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and building a democracy, a -- a new <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , being -- seeing -- seeing this develop from nothing, it was a great experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And I think that up to today, the -- the fact that you have -- with all the hardships that went with building a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in hostile environment, that they remained a true democracy and that hopefully they will finish the job of making peace with the neighbors, like it was started by Rabin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">QUESTION:  Yeah, I was just about to ask you, how do you feel about politics right now in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">ANSWER:  What I find gratifying is that when I was living there in the 50’s, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , early 50’s, the hatred was so strong, and the distrust and it’s so deep rooted, and propaganda was -- that was being fed by the dictatorships on the <span class="REGION">Arab side</span> , more so than on our side, that I did not think that when they started to negotiate with the Palestinians, I did not believe that peace would be possible so f -- in our generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I thought that it would take much more then one generation to build a new understanding -- an understanding and cooperation. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">However, I proved -- I was proven wrong and that, due to the fact that you had great leaders, leadership is everything in politics and that was both on the <span class="REGION">Egyptian side</span> with Sadat, on the <span class="REGION">Israeli side</span> , people like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and Rabin and hopefully that this trend can continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">QUESTION:  Who in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> do you admire?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">ANSWER:  I must say that in spite of all the failings of the president, President Clinton, I think, in -- in as far as the leadership quality, I think that he is -- has proven -- to me, has been a great president. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Whether his personal behavior should permit him to be th - to continue to be the president, that’s a different discussion, but I think that as a political -- as a leader of the free world, I think that he has proven himself very effective.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  Do you follow at all controversies, or the work in general of the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Because I wanted to ask you how you felt about the incidents when the then director of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> refused to give Yasir Arafat a formal welcome VIP treatment, when he came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> recently?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  As a officer of a public foundation, I don’t know if he had the right to make these decisions, whether single-handedly can -- should make such decisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">On the other hand, I know that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York city</span> , Mayor Guiliani did similar things, that he would not invite him to functions in <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> , or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Of course, Guiliani must have done it for his political reasons, but in the case of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , I think it should have been coordinated with the -- and advice asked from the Israeli government and from the Board of Directors and not make it into a scandal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  Is there an <span class="REGION">area</span> that we haven’t addressed yet, that you would like to talk about a little bit more? </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Any <span class="REGION">area</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  At the moment, I cannot think of anyth -- a specific thing to add.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">QUESTION:  A little bit more about your family life, maybe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  I find that when the children were little, that we had tried to be always -- find more time to spend with them, and whether it was taking trips, or taking them to games, that it was very, very helpful, both to us and to them, that we can look back, that we have so much in common, that even though my son is living in <span class="REGION">California</span> , we feel as if he was around the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">We are in constant communication, at least once a week, do get to see him often and I think it helped in our relations with our children in general, to -- to spend as much time with them as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Of course, my daughter and her three children live close by, and we see them on the average, three times a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And I think it’s a very, very gratifying experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  How many grandchildren do you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  My daughter has three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">A pair of twin boys and the oldest son 1s 12, the twins are eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">My son, who 1s now 32 years old, is finally getting married next year, so we are hoping to have -- to see more grandchildren there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  Do you -- Is your sister still alive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  My sister is -- lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and she also has a son and a daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Her daughter is also maybe two years older, and my sister is four and a half years older than myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">So her daughter is probably 44 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">She has two children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">QUESTION:  Do you see each other on a regular basis, or -- are you in touch still?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">ANSWER:  We do -- We do sometimes plan vacations together, but in the last few years -- excuse me -- in the last few years her husband has been -- his health -- ill health, so we did not take too many vacations together. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">We are in touch by phone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  When you look back on the last 50 years of your life, or 55 years, what would you may have -- what would you have made different? </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Do you think you have made mistakes, or did everything turn out the way you -- do you think that’s -- that’s the best I could do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">ANSWER:  I cannot say that I have big regrets about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I don’t -- I -- 1t’s hard for me to say if I would do everything the same way as I did, but I have no regrets about choices that I have made.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  On that note, I would like to conclude the interview with Abraham Malach, unless you have a final thing that you would like to say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">ANSWER:  I can’t think of anything special right now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  Then we have said what there was to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Thank you very much for giving the interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">ANSWER:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">End of Tape Three, Side A Conclusion of Interview </span>
