QUESTION:  So you’re now two years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">https://collections.ushmm.org August 9, 2012
ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And while we’re hiding in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , my mother, my father, my baby sister and I, he escapes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and manages to get across a <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> just as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Nazi munitions train</span> was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So the sentries had shot his finger, but as he was jumping down, they shot him in the hand and shot his finger. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And he started running away as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was coming by. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And of course they did not dare fire at that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> because there would be a massive explosion. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Then while he was running this was in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , a very deep <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And he met a peasant named Mr. Borecki. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And Mr. Borecki, a lot of this is in my grandfather’s diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Mr. Borecki gave him a jacket, rags to wrap around his feet, because my grandfather was a very big man and no shoes could fit him. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So and he gave him, and he bandaged his hand and had him sleep in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and gave him three breads. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And my grandfather said look, I know helping Jews could --. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He said well Pll just leave my <span class="DLF">barn door</span> open. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Then if I get asked, I could say I don’t know who sleeps in my <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So my grandfather did that and the next day he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And when he was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , oh and he was given a shovel. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , he was sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And suddenly he heard two or three men speaking Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And they had escaped an aktion, very near this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And one of them had a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And they -- my grandfather had been trained for military service as an officer, I guess because he looked good on a horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The Polish cavalry. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">He did. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And I think that’s why they took him. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But anyway, so he was -- they made him the leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They dug this <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> and that’s the one that I called the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Ok, it’s a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And —
QUESTION:  How far from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Quite a ways I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Because this was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> — now, I'll describe the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> in just a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But when grandfather went back to Mr. Borecki, he asked him two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">One was did he know anything, his -- Mr. Borecki’s son had been killed by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Because he was in the resistance, in the Polish resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Now but before then he had told his father that the Nazis were going to bomb the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So my grandfather knew that it was just a matter of time before my father and my mother and my baby sister and I lost our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Now I’m going to switch back and tell you about the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">https://collections.ushmm.org August 9, 2012 The <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> to me of course it was, I remember cold, damp mud. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And there was a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> to go in and as I remember it, it seemed very tall. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Probably it was no more than six feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And as you walked around, you felt this cold, wet mud. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And at one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , here was the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Then there was this cold wet mud. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And here at the corner, at the very end, was a fat, was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , like the kind that electric wire comes on, those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">spool tables</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And I just, I remember it feeling splintery. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And I remember the smell of the candle wax because there was a fat candle sitting on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And then again some more wet mud. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Then like an <span class="DLF">archway</span> out of mud again and a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">On the, as you walked into that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , on the left were things that I later found out were guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">What I, and how I, I only knew that I touched them and my grandfather smacked my hand and yelled and he never, ever raised his voice to me, much less his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And that’s when I realized those were dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I don’t remember the people in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Now I’m going to switch back and tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Eventually there were 37 people in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But when my grandfather found out that the Nazis were going to bomb the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> he asked for volunteers and he, everybody, all the men volunteered, and he took two and they dressed in Nazi uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Well I have to tell you that how they lived at this time was that the men would go out and raid <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Nazi trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">They would raise, they would kill the drivers and take —
QUESTION:  They were escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  They were not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They were in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And they would go out on raids where they would raid Nazi munitions, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , outposts. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Take whatever, food, clothing, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Now the -- at this time the Banderovski who were Ukrainian resistance were in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and they were very powerful and they were very numerous and the Nazis would keep trying to bomb and try to get rid of them and they didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So the Nazis thought that these Jews who were raiding them were Banderovski, these Ukrainian resistance fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But they were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Now the Banderovski didn’t like Jews much at all, except they would take Jews if the Jews were doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Otherwise, and the agreement was, ok stay out of our way. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We’ll stay out of your way kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We’ll leave you alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And that’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Well my grandfather found out that the Nazis from Mr. Borecki who had found out from his son, the Nazis were going to burn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> so he got the two volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They all dressed in Nazi https://collections.ushmm.org August 9, 2012 uniforms, had commandeered a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Nazi jeep</span> and drove to the outskirts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">The two men stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">My grandfather in Nazi regalia, went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , got my mother, my father, my baby sister and me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Put us in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and brought us to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of Mr. Borecki. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Because my grandfather had spoken to Mr. Borecki and asked him if he would save my mother and the two girls’ lives and he said of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And so we came in the middle of the night and we were at Mr. Borecki’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my mother said I will not leave my husband or you, father. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I will not. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I’ve already lost my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I’m not going to lose you. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So they had no choice but all of us now went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  This is 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  Do you know what month or what season?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  I-
QUESTION:  That’s all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  It probably was still winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Because there was snow and the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> was still relatively safe because the Nazis could, dogs could not get the scent and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So it was winter, probably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  End of 43?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  Yes, mm hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Towards the end of 43, right, mm hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Then apparently and this I hear from my grandfather, my baby sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Oh there were 37 people in that <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">My mother and my father and us. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">My grandfather’s son, my uncle, his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And I think their two boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">They had two boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">My sister and I were the youngest, by far. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I guess we cried and got lice and people were very afraid because we endangered the lives of everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And my grandfather felt that he just could not do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">That his family could not endanger everybody else because everyone wanted to live and they had the right to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">https://collections.ushmm.org August 9, 2012 So he decided to take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">He had gotten a peasant sheepskin jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">He dressed himself as a Polish peasant and took my baby sister and me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I guess according to my grandfather, I had blond hair and dark eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">My sister had light hair and gray eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And he took us both and he went to the <span class="BUILDING">local market</span> , looking for someone named Dr. Gruen. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Dr. Gruen was a Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I think he was Catholic, very famous pediatrician who ran an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> for Catholic children. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And he looked for, but he couldn’t find him. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And he was so desperate and this he writes in his diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He was so desperate about what to do with us when he couldn’t find Dr. Gruen, that he almost was ready, he was ready to leave us in the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , thinking somebody would find us and keep us. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And keep us alive during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">But just as he was thinking of that, he saw a woman who had been a former neighbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">A Polish Catholic woman whose husband had been killed by the Nazis in one of their mass reprisals. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And my grandfather had helped her with her horse and carriage business. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So she saw him and recognized him and he brought her to the side where they would not be heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And of course she said she was so happy to know that he was alive and then he said he had these two children and he couldn’t find Dr. Gruen. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And at that point, he said could you take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And my grandmother had had to sell her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because the people she had working for her were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And they were all in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and so she couldn’t make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So she started working as a cook for a retired engineer and his wife, the Szwarczynskis, somewhere in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">It must have been near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And the story they told was that my grandfather was her husband that the two of us were her sister’s children. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Now at that time many people were back and forth, going towards the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> and, and so the story she told was that her sisters had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> and left their babies with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And then she asked Mrs. Szwarczynski could she, could grandma take both. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And Mrs. Szwarczynski said yes, she could take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But she couldn’t take a six month old baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So my grandfather went, again he asked for how to find Dr. Gruen and this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And apparently Mr. Szwarczynski knew Dr. Gruen and he told him where the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> was and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So grandpa had — now remember all this time he’s passing as a Polish peasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Very big one. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But the Polish peasant and because my grandfather was six, two and well over 200 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">He was -- just an aside. </span><span

QUESTION:  You were telling me about your sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  My sister’s name was changed from Tola to Antonina Noviska, which was the name of the woman who saved our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Lucia Noviska and that’s when she was left there. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And I stayed with the Szwarczynskis and my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I have a picture, the first picture I have of me was at around that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I was probably around two and a half at this point maybe even three. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And I had been following my grandmother who was going into the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> to forage for whatever she could find in the way of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And —
QUESTION:  Do you remember this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  I, again I remember —
QUESTION:  Flashes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  Flashes, that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I remember that I wanted her to play with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I remember that we picked dandelions together. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And she made me a wreath out of dandelions. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And I remember putting it on and then following her but then falling asleep, just falling asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And this I was told later. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">That grandma had gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , thinking that I had probably gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And when she didn’t find me there, she was standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> waiting for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And ready to go look for me with Mrs. Szwarczynski. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And she saw a Nazi soldier, carrying what she thought was my dead body. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And so she was about to scream when Mrs. Szwarczynski put her hand over her mouth and told her to stay calm. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And the soldier came and at that point I can’t, I don’t know but I woke up. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And so grandma was just unbelievably relieved. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And the soldier had said that I was asleep and he found me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And I reminded him of his children back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and so he was bringing me to the closest <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because he was sure that’s where I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So some kind of way later he had the picture developed and grandma got it and she took that picture, saved it and after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And by the way that picture is in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">As is a picture of my birth mother, father, uncle and two friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">https://collections.ushmm.org August 9, 2012 Well anyway then we were still there with the Szwarczynskis. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">The Szwarczynskis had a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Great big huge German shepherd, really fierce watchdog. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So fierce that he was not in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">He was kept on a chain <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> and fed with a long stick. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And one day, again this I was told. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">One day the dog was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and I went over to the dog and my grandmother was about to scream again. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And Mrs. Szwarczynski kept her from yelling and I went over to the dog and petted the dog and he started licking me and we became great buddies. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Now what I do remember is that when the Nazis came I was told to take the dog and go under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with the dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Now one possibility is that, that just as they said to make sure that the dog didn’t remove the Nazi’s leg because he had bitten a Nazi before. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">The other possibility, although it’s fairly remote is that they suspected I was a Jewish child. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">But I think that’s fairly remote because they were a bit anti- Semitic also. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And my, there was a woman on the <span class="DLF">street</span> near where the Szwarczynskis lived who had told the Nazis that Lucia Noviska was hiding a Jewish child. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So the Nazis came and took her and she was imprisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And tortured. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And my grandfather of course found out about that and he went to Mrs. Szwarczynski and said look, you have to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">We have to get my wife out. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And Mrs. Szwarczynski was a good friend of the wife of the commandant and so Mrs. Szwarczynski went to the commandant and said you know look, to the wife and said to her, look you know the Nazis have taken my cook and I don’t know what we’re going to do because we need her. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And she certainly 1s not hiding any Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And the commandant’s wife talked to her husband and the next thing is that the commandant came and she was released from <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and told not to talk about it to anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And she was released and came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Now what I remember I had — I was in kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I remember a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> with a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> to get to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And I just remember a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> that I would climb out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> and into. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">One day I heard some noise, lots and lots of noise and the dog came. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And grabbed me, some kind of way. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Either I was on the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> , I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">But the dog grabbed my clothing or grabbed me, something, and took me to the <span class="DLF">door</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And I don’t know, I don’t know where this was vis a vis the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I don’t remember any of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I do remember the dog taking me. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And I do remember that a bomb fell on where I had been sleeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So cause there was lots of bombing going on at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And —
QUESTION:  This is what, spring of 44? </span><span class="sentence" id="286">https://collections.ushmm.org August 9, 2012
ANSWER:  This is I think not, yes, not, not, not spring yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Probably — like February. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">In April of 1944, right around my birthday my grandfather talked to my grandmother and said look I have to go back and see how everybody is doing in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And so I’m going to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So he went back to the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  Your grandfather?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  And (pause, sigh) and then in 1944 in June, the Russians came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And the one advantage we had with the Russians at that time was because grandpa was a survivor of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">killing camp</span> , the Russians gave him preferential treatment which meant that he could get an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the bombed out <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">He could get rags for clothes, that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So that’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And that was right around my birthday I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And then we went to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> which 1s displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">But I like to think of it as delayed pilgrims. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Yes so very delayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So then —

<p><span class="sentence" id="540">ANSWER:  Yes, to make those funny sounds, mm hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And now I’m back with Aunt Siegel. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">No, Aunt Helen. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Aunt Helen Fichtenbaum was my grandfather’s youngest sibling. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And she shared a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with her older sister Rosa who was widowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And Rosa had a daughter Elaine Yeta, who was 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And Aunt Helen had a daughter Perry, who was 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And a husband, Dick. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And they lived in half of a <span class="BUILDING">duplex</span> in a very Orthodox section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And the first day that I remember was Aunt Helen taking me to their <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and cutting my hair, because she was very sure that I had lice, so she cut my hair which made me cry because I was so proud of not having lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">It was a big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And then I was a student at the <span class="BUILDING">local elementary school</span> where the only teacher in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> who spoke any language I did was the kindergarten teacher who spoke German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">QUESTION:  What language by that old age of seven did you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">ANSWER:  Oh I knew a little bit of Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish, German. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And Ukrainian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">QUESTION:  You knew Russian? </span><span class="sentence" id="557">https://collections.ushmm.org August 9, 2012
ANSWER:  A little bit, very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And so I went to the <span class="BUILDING">local school</span> and the children called me retard because I was tall for my age and here I was in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> at age seven. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And seven and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And they also called me Nazi because the language I spoke was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And Aunt Helen was a very troubled woman and it was very hard for her to take this child who had come from a war torn <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and who was a granddaughter of this absent older brother that she idealized. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And I was not a pretty child at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And so she didn’t know quite what to do with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">She was a little overwhelmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Her daughter Perry was allergic to everything and Perry and I shared a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And I just remember being truly, truly unhappy and waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I couldn’t wait for the weekends when I would go see Tante Siegel. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Tante Siegel was my father’s aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And she is the one who sponsored my coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">She lived in the <span

apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">This one bedroom apartment, as you walked in the <span class="DLF">door</span> you looked directly at some <span class="DLF">French doors</span> covered by lace curtains that were the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And otherwise you saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> , a couple of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and a black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone</span> and a glass bottle near the telephone where everyone who wanted to make a call had to put in a nickel. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Then there were tzedakah boxes all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they were blue with white Jewish stars on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">They were all for some cause or other in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">For <span class="BUILDING">yeshivas</span> , for <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , for whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And Tante Siegel herself was about four foot ten with huge round blue eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">High cheekbones, a Clara Bow mouth and a very, very pretty face. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Blondish gray hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Her brother, Uncle Charlie, also was short but a little taller than she. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And I met him a little afterwards and he had a <span class="DLF">farm</span> in the Adirondacks that he had apparently sold the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">He had had five daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">He and his wife Sophie had five daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Like Tevya. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And no sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So he sold the <span class="DLF">farm</span> but kept the <span class="BUILDING">bungalow</span> which was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And there was a man-made <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> and I remember Uncle Charlie driving me in this beat up black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> over these hairpin turns at what seemed like umpteen miles an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Well of course it wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">But I remember Uncle Charlie’s huge hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">He had these hand with large knuckles and when I first saw Van Gogh’s the Potato Eaters, I could always remember Uncle Charlie cause that’s what he looked like, his hands looked like. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Well back to Aunt Helen -- Tante Siegel and her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">There was a <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">On the <span class="DLF">door</span> was — the <span class="DLF">window</span> was on the left and I remember I would sit at that <span class="DLF">window</span> for hours and hours and hours and just look out and just look out. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">There, it was all concrete. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">There was some kind of a <span class="DLF">basketball court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">You know concrete <span class="DLF">playground</span> with a high <span class="DLF">fence</span> , metal fence around it and I would watch people play. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And I remember feeling very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">But Tante Siegel was very, very https://collections.ushmm.org August 9, 2012 warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And her husband Uncle Jake, was a little taller than she. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Huge, beak like nose, but Uncle Jake almost never spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">He was like a shadow. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">So we never knew what he was thinking or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">He just was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">He might as well have been invisible. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">But I loved those times at Tante Siegel’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Tante Siegel had two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">She had Marvin who was in the army, very good looking and I only saw his pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And she had Adele who was married to Sid Roman. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And they were supposed to move to an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the other side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> but it wasn’t ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So they were staying with Tante Siegel. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Had to pull out something. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So to say there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">So the Joint wouldn’t let me live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And, but I loved going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And I heard from my cousin Sid, many years later he had given me a huge teddy bear which he had won at a fair and he was going to give it to their first child. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">But he said, you looked so sad and needy there that I thought maybe I better give it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">So he gave it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And I, very imaginative child, named this teddy bear, Louka, which means doll in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">But oh I loved that teddy bear. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And that was a happy time. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And Tante Siegel would have a yummy brunch every Sunday with white fish and sable, and lox and bagels and cheeses and tomatoes and all kinds of yummy stuff, always milchig. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And I would be doing dishes and I inevitably used the wrong dish towel. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And we had to go find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that had any dirt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">But that was a challenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">So that was Tante Siegel. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I remember once Aunt Rosa who always looked unbelievably chic. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">She had a black chignon. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I’m sure she died her hair but she was very regal looking, in contrast to her sister Aunt Helen who always looked bedraggled and harried. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">In shapeless housedresses which were ugly. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Never smiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Anyway Aunt, Tante Rosa worked <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And one day she took me out for lunch and to buy me a new skirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And the skirt, I remember was gray but it was kind of full, had big pockets with blue trim on the pocket, the top part of the pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And I thought it was gorgeous. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And I wore it back to Aunt Helen’s and I remember her yelling in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> where Aunt Helen was yelling and saying why did you take that brat? </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Why didn’t you take Perry? </span><span class="sentence" id="637">She deserves it. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">That brat doesn’t deserve anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I don’t know what Isaac and that woman were thinking of. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And I decided that I wouldn’t wear the skirt by Aunt Helen because all it did was get Tante Rosa in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So I would only wear it at <span class="BUILDING">Tante Siegel’s</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Well, one day I remembered, I was still a bit of a ring leader and Perry was very, very shy and I remember saying to Perry, let’s go visit Yeta’s <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , Elaine, at that time she was called Elaine’s https://collections.ushmm.org August 9, 2012 room. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was in the very front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it had one of those satiny bedspreads that I -- quilted satin, and all these cologne bottles on a blond mirrored <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dresser</span> which I thought was so gorgeous. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And they all smelled so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">So I remember that was just a whole new world. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Yeta was a -- Elaine wasn’t thrilled that these two younger went to her
