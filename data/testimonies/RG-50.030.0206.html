<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strehlen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">This is <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> ...is the province of <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  You're welcome.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Tell me...tell me something about your family and your childhood, would you? </span><span class="sentence" id="11">What was it like? </span><span class="sentence" id="12">What was your family like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  My family was in four generations in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> --in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strehlen</span> , what is very famous by a very famous man, name of Paul Ehrlich.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And we had a business in glass porcelain or crystal for four generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">It was by... my great grandfather found[ed] it. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And he came originally from a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chels</span> , <span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">That was the only place where Jews could settle. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And then the law got that people Jews could settle in other <span class="NPIP">parts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So they settled down in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and bought a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> just opposite the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> and we had this <span class="BUILDING">store</span> for 110 years in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It went from father to son. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And what happened, if it wouldn't be that the Nazis came to power with the SA and SSA and SS, special life in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> were impossible anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And that is the reason we finally decided to give it up and sell it, even we couldn't find a buyer who paid a lot money--because they know that Jews had to sell 1t. So we had to sell..sold the business for a very low price. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And we moved to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> what was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> [NB: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wroclaw</span> ].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  When was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  That was in the...we sold it the end of 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And then we moved to the capital what was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> and we settled...we got a <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">That was Wall Street-- Wallstrasse. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">It was direct next to the Jewish Federation--they called it Judische Gemeinde-- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It was next door. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And uh, we lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">It was direct for all the Jewish people on this same <span class="DLF">street</span> were the seminar, the rabbinical seminar, what was very famous. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And also the...we had access to both the <span class="BUILDING">orthodox synagogue</span> there--they called the ' Winner of the Nobel Prize in Medicine for 1908. </span><span class="sentence" id="33"><span class="BUILDING">Storch Synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">That was all next door.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Go back a little bit because we have gone... we have jumped from really childhood to 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And it's a big jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Tell me about...you are a young man...tell me...by '37... Tell me, when you say "we," were you married by this time? </span><span class="sentence" id="40">What was it like first growing up in that family? </span><span class="sentence" id="41">About your courtship a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">What were you doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  I was originally... You know, my parents wanted me to get...learn a trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So I...they send me to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">First I was in very big <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> ; and after I finished there, they sent me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> --what was at that time the capital...Capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> --where I worked in the largest <span class="BUILDING">store</span> ...largest firm what was in the wholesale 1n porcelain. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They always also had to have their own <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ; and I took care of the business and I sold there. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And I was very happy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">But one day, one of my uncles came to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And he said, "Better come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because this will get worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">The business...was the time already the Nazis started in 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And it got worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So I had to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">That was in...in the year of 1926. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And help my father in the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So it went...but it went worse and worse, and it was impossible to continue for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So this is in... Wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">You came back in 1926?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> from 1924 'til 1926. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But I came back, because I unk...uh...about the situation, what was very unbearable in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Much...it was much worse than living in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , what not everybody know the other person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Tell me about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">How do you mean worse? </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Because in '26, it was...1t not yet Hitler in full power, but things were happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">That's important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I tell you what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The people...it was not Hitler didn't come to power, but also it was the anti-Semitism was very worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And they made on the big...opposite our... We was, as I mentioned before, in the main <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> , opposite the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And they erected in the...in front of the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> , a special sign for Streicher. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Everybody knew who Streicher was. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">He was one of the worst Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He had a paper they called the Der Sttirmer; and the put all the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And they put on a sign: "Kauft Nicht bei Juden"--"Don't buy in <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So in other word, people should sabotage the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We were only a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We were not many Jews families. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Just a few families. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And there was opposite our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> also a little <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> belong to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And they had signs there, and said, "Go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> !" </span><span class="sentence" id="82">They put it even in front of the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="83">Jews get out! </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> !" </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So in other word, it was not that Hitler was in power, but it was the anti-Semitism was always in..in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> a big factor. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">It also in this...1n this <span class="BUILDING">schule</span> , I went there to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they call the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ... They don't call 1t <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ; they call it "<span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And it was when you was only one of the few Jewish people, you got ignored. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Or the people didn't like the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">That's very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">It's very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So it's...so the year is 1926. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">You are back helping your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Now move it forward for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Tell us what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  What happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It...year by year...I mean I tried the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We had a big <span class="DLF">window</span> and one night, the Nazis just destroyed all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They throw stones and also...what happened...you couldn't have...they brought laws out...you couldn't hire...only employee Aryan people. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">That mean...Aryan mean German people. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We had in our <span class="BUILDING">household</span> what you call a maid, and the father came there and said...told her, "Get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">You shouldn't work for the Jews." </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So big...so it was the anti-semitism that they all was afraid or there was special to the propaganda was so big that Gentile shouldn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Now I tell you another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I used to go in the evening after the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> closed to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And it was geting worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And we know in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , everybody knew everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">The other...the Gentile people didn't even look at you and didn't greet you. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I remember one night I went to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> to pick up my parents who went to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ...to pick...picked them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I was followed by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They followed me everyday and they...I was afraid to go out especially in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It was getting worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">That what happened between 1926 and '37. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So we had...even my father said, "This business is for hundred ten years 1n the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It should be in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">You shouldn't sell it." </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Now I have to make an interruption. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">When we had our hundred anniversary-- and this was in 1926. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It was a big celebration in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , because there was no other business was...was that long hundred years existing. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So not only the mayor came, and everybody, all the big..the big uh people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And it was real...a big celebration. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And this paper, the largest paper...there were two papers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...they both made all big stories about the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They even made the poem and it was just wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And as..as a matter of fact, the editor came the day before to me and interviewed me and the...the whole paper was full about our hundred year anniversary. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But it changed radically. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Just after this, a few years...years later, people didn't come in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">In other words, we were unable to exist because people were afraid because our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was direct on the...on the...most visible place at the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> so they were afraid to come in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And then became the big boycott. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">That was on the Ist of April 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">They put Nazis in front of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and say don't buy at Jews...buy Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So in other words, people were afraid to come and buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So in other words, we had to make the very difficult decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We couldn't get on see as big...as good as possible and we..uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">organized a sale. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">There was only allowed if the sale is for giving up the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So...and that was on the end of 1937 when we had to sell our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and we had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And, uh, even the people who lived there as our renters were afraid to live in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> what belonged to Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So when you sold the business finally, you had to sell the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  We had to sell the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and we sold the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> together with the..with the..with the business, and as you can imagine, they gave very little because they know that the...that we had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So in other words, the price was...was not what the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was worth and what the...what the..business was worth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Now...you said, now you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> from there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We moved...we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">That is not far away, is about 25 miles, 35 kilometers, and we settled weeks before. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">My mother went there and...uh...we found a <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> what were Jewish...owned by Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">It was next to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community center</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Who is we? </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Who is with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Who is part of the family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  This I tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We were only 2 children, and my parents and...and...my...my...my sister and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">That was 4 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was not...it was...belonged to...to others...to...to...to Jewish sisters, so we...we rented it from them, but were were very comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It was..uh..not big. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It was a few <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , but we were glad that we was in a, ina <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we...nobody knew us. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And that was the advantage that in the beginning in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> you could go on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and nobody called you names of the Jew because in the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> opposite in this war, everyone 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ....this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had only about 10,000 population. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So in other words, we were relieved. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But it didn't last long. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">As you know, that...Hitler gave all the laws against the Jews, and that was in...in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">To just remind you that what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , a Jew by the name of Hershel Grynszpan shot an officer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , you know, from the <span class="BUILDING">German Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And then that what happened the Aktion against the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Let's talk about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Where were you during Kristallnacht? </span><span class="sentence" id="171">What happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I'll tell you what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">When we moved to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , I didn't want to sit and do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So, we had in our business a lot of people what we know who came from the other <span class="NPIP">places</span> and showed what...we had somebody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslow</span> who owned a wholesale...a glass business. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So I went to them and, uh, I got a job there. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I worked there to go around in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ...g0 out...go to several enterprises and sold them...and that what what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Sold the glassware what..what the...what their business was. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And then, in the meantime, the Nazis had prepared also already what to do in the case of emergency. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">What did they do? </span><span class="sentence" id="181">They had registered at all the Jews at the..the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">In other words, when the Kristallnacht started and the order by Goebbels to arrest all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">They had the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So they went to every <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and picked them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But what happened...I wasn't there, because I was in the business--which was about maybe 10 blocks away. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So they came to my father; and they asked him, "Where's your son?" </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And he said, "He works in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> ." "</span><span class="sentence" id="188">Give us the address." </span><span class="sentence" id="189">He said, "I don't know." </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Even if he know, he didn't want to tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">So I was Safe at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">As a matter of fact, when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that night they were surprised that I was surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Because I was hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I know what was... what happened, what went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So I was hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> all day, when I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I didn't imagine it would it would continue the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">But at first, I want to tell you what happened in the Kristallnacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  Just to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Just to you.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  So I had my own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> what I told you was just next door. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">When in the night, middle of the night, I hear that terrible noise and I didn't know what...what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">What happened was that the Nazis came in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community center</span> ..was the <span class="BUILDING">orthodox synagogue</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And they called it <span class="BUILDING">Storch Synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">But the Nazis was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">It was this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was direct in the middle of...of many <span class="BUILDING">apartment houses</span> , and they were afraid to put it afire...sit afire, because it would have burned out the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So what they did, they just crushed and destroyed the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and the interior and that was that noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">But in the meantime, that was the main <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that was about 10 blocks away, they called the new <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">The most beautiful <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with a big cupola, and they set it afire. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And this was what I saw and what I heard in the Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But the main thing happened the next day, they not only went to the every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...and in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , there was only Jews living...in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> where we lived, but they went also in the <span class="DLF">street</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and they..they caught all on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Jews what they caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And brought them...brought them to the police stations. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Now, I tell you what happened with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I went the next morning to a business because I was the impression that the razzia against the Jews was finished, but I made a big mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">They continued and so when I made the mistake at lunchtime to go out of our <span class="BUILDING">complex</span> where the business were. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">When I run direct in the hands of the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">When I came out I saw four people. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Two Gestapo who just had arrested two Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">They asked me, "Are you a Jew?" </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Well, no; I couldn't say not. "</span><span class="sentence" id="223">So...so come with us." </span><span class="sentence" id="224">If] would run away, they would they would have shoot at me...shoot me..shot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So there was about..from there a few blocks away was the <span class="BUILDING">local police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And when we came there we found a lot of people already there. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So they called up the main <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> ...<span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> ...was just opposite where the new <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Please send us a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">We have a lot of people here. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And we all was brought to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> from the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">They took all our belongings and they took the fingerprints and we had downstairs was a big <span class="DLF">garden</span> or a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">There was thousand and thousand people and they kept us there the whole day...the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And they had a big reason for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They wanted to wait til 1t was dark because they didn't want to show the population what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">When it was dark, they put us in a big column. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">There was a few thousand people and they walked with us through the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to the main <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">But we came by the...the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and we were so shocked to see what happened to that beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">It was all burned out. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">When we came finally, after walking a half hour, to the main <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , there was always already a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> waiting so they put us all in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and in each <span class="NPIP">place</span> they put a special of their people, a police man. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And I was surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I met a lot of people there, and we went...we had no idea where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Nobody knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">We traveled the whole night, about 20...over 20 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And finally we arrived at a very famous <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> is very famous by two big poets, Goethe and Schiller. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And we knew exactly that here that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  You knew about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> before you got there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  I tell you exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I knew, because an uncle of mine was about 6 months before there. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And they had arrested him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and sent him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And he died there, because he was on a special diet and he couldn't get the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And I went special...I told my father, I went to... When they sent the ashes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I went special there; and it was there on the big <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weissensee</span> (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and they had a big <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And I had my case...briefcase; but the whole ceremony were observed... witnessed by the Nazi, by the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">So I was afraid to move around, because they was looking for something. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So that 1s why I know that my uncle was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And what...what was his crime? </span><span class="sentence" id="257">He went one evening to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , he had a yahrtzeit [Yidd: remembrance of a deceased person on the anniversary of his or her death] for his father--my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And when he came there, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And he want to know...and he went around to the Gestapo watched him. "</span><span class="sentence" id="260">What...what you want to do here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So they arrested him; and they took him right away to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and they sent him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And there where he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So in other words, I knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , so he was there before I came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So what...what happened now? </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We had to ran in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">They put us in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> ; and they warn, "Don't move." </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And then we had to run through an <span class="DLF">underground tunnel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And there was on both sides Gestapo Nazi men with [Gemitkolben (ph)], with uh...
QUESTION:  Clubs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  With clubs. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And they beat us, beat up. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Everybody beat up. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And I know I saw when people fell down, among them was my boss where I worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">He was a wonderful Jewish man and he also died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> because they beat him...they beat him to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">That went before we came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Then they loaded us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And they shouted, "Don't look. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Don't look on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And I made the mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I looked and they threw a stone at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And it was a miracle the stone didn't...didn't hit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So finally we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and there was already 20,000 people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">When we came they didn't know that so many people were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">They came from all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So the...our <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were supposed to stay wasn't finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And they were still <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So we...we had to...out...the whole day sitting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> and sitting and waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Then in the evening we went in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and people got crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">They had around watchtowers and they had a <span class="DLF">electric fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I remember the first three nights was worst night I ever remember because people were not allowed to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">The people lost their mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">They run around. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">There was five <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They run around the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and just from the <span class="DLF">watchtowers</span> , the people on the <span class="DLF">watchtowers</span> starting shooting them...shot them and the people shouted and cried and I heard that all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">But the worst thing happened the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We were allowed on the day to go out, but many people didn't go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">It was terrible cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="298"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> is...1s high in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> ... that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and it was special built for this purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">What happened people went and went to the <span class="DLF">electric fence</span> ..<span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">As soon as they touched them, they got killed, automatically. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">But not only this, everybody who touched this same person got also killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">When I saw that, how people fell down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">When they let them laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And it was a terrible sight, but there was a much worse thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">It was impossible to escape from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Every morning we had appeal at 6:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">They called us out and we had to stay there and they counted us, and when somebody was missing we had to stay there the whole day until they found the person, brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But some people were able to escape, and they escaped to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and the...the German government what was already the Nazi government demanded to send them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So the worse day was...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> was when this man was sent back and he was condemned to die on the gallows. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And we were forced...there was an announcement through the loud speaker [and] everybody from all the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> had to come out and watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And, of course, it was a terrible thing to see what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And we were supposed to watch this, the hanging of this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So you can imagine what the mood was. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We were not allowed to walk to work because...but they wanted us to do something, so we had to move everyday the stones from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other, to the other <span class="NPIP">corner</span> , and we was busy this. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">The food, of course, the food were terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">In the beginning they gave us nothing and then they got...they get everybody should go and get the money what they had brought and what they took away from the people, they brought the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But, of course, the dishes, we all had to drink the soup from the same bowl-- everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And they gave us [wall fish (ph)]...[wall fish (ph)] food. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So the conditions were worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">We had special arranged services and the Rabbis there went around and say "Please eat" because there was many people they didn't want to eat the food because it wasn't kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So the rabbis went around and told the people, but some didn't...they didn't do it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But what happened is that we had secretly arranged services. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Every morning we put <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ...somebody watched that nobody came from the...from the people there...from the Nazis...and we had our prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">But another thing happened every day on the appell. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">On the morning appell, that the Nazi what were in charge, they took off and counted and they punched the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So I was smart enough not to stand in the first row that I didn't get punched. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">But what happened that the people...the conditions got everyday worse, and people died from starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">We was...the conditions in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was even worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">We were laying on just wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">There was no blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">There was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And there was some people had food. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Some people had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">They could buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So they helped the people, the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Now we come to the first Erev of Hanukkah. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I was there; and that was a wonderful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">We were sitting in our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and sung the Hanukkah songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And we also had prepared... The people had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">They brought special cookies and a cake.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">QUESTION:  How did they get it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  There was a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">They had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> there; and the people who got money, they could go and buy it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  But for me, the most surprise happened on the second day of Hanukkah. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">In the morning, I heard over the loudspeaker my name called. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And they said, "Please..." Not "please." "</span><span class="sentence" id="348">Come all the people..."--I was not the only one--"Come after, to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So when I came to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , they told me that they got a paper from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , from my parents, that they had booked for me a passage to <span class="COUNTRY">Panama</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And that was the one what my cousin told him [that] my mother went to the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And I have the documents; and so that was the only reason that they let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So after that, in the afternoon, they put us on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">They gave us even some money; because it was a long, a long trip with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So we went first with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> , and they put us there in that...1n that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">On this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , was the first <span class="BUILDING">station</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">That was a very big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">It's very famous. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">There goes to there every year a very big fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And there lived a lot of Jews, maybe...mostly Jews from the east from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And they had prepared for us a special reception; and they gave us some... And so we was on the, of course, on this <span class="BUILDING">station</span> was a very large <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">But I wanted to go out, because I know this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Because I went every...every year to that fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And I went in the night for a walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And I was amazed I saw how the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish store</span> was all destroyed, all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I went all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> and all the <span class="DLF">streets</span> ; and I saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And so it happened in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">They destroyed in the night from the 8th to the 9th of November 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">That was the day of the Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So they destroyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Then I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ; and we arrived in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">In the morning, the next morning, we arrived in the...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">But in...they had told us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> before they let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">They say, "The first thing you come...you arrive at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you have to go to the Gestapo and report. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And they will tell you what to do." </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But we made a very big mistake, and I make the biggest mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">In this...in this..in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> ...in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we talked to the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And we said, "No, it is Friday." </span><span class="sentence" id="379">You know, Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We came on Friday. "</span><span class="sentence" id="381">We will go...we will not go. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">We will go on..." I mean, Friday night, we thought we wait for Monday. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And what happened with me, when I came Monday to the Gestapo, they said, "When did you come?" </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I said, "We came Friday night." "</span><span class="sentence" id="385">Why didn't you come the next morning?" </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I say the reason was that I was very dirty and all, the... when we was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> we had...we couldn't change our clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">We couldn't take no <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> , no <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> ; and I wanted to be clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">But they didn't...they said, "Wait here." </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And I waited and waited and waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And my parents were worried...were very worried, because I say early I will come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="392">It was a Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And they left me wait the whole morning from 9 o'clock til 1 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And then they called me in and said, "Why didn't you come? </span><span class="sentence" id="395">You know what we will do. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">We will send you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">To another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , because you didn't obey the order." </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And I was very scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">So finally I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and my parents...what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I had to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I was the last one but everybody...all was gone.</span></p>
