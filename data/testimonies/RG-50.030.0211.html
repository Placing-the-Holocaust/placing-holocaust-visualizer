QUESTION:  And what, what happened when you were twelve years old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  My father died. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">My father took sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">He was never sick in his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">He worked like a horse to support his wife and the five daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">He didn't have to support me then because I was eating days in the yeshiva. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And the first week he took sick, he died in three, four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They sent a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> -- there was no, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motor vehicles</span> in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And if there would have been already a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> that what would be cruising from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aniksht</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilkomir</span> , my family didn't have the money to pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> who was cruising constantly, twice a week from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aniksht</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilkomir</span> , picked me up to take me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">When I walked in in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the father's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was standing 1n the middle of the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And I managed to come over to his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and tell him, "Father, it's me, Dovid Yankele." </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And he managed to move his hand over my body with affection, and a few minutes later he was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">The lederer Rov,’ the chief rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aniksht</span> , who was this really holy man, he explain me that my father would have been dead three, four days ago -- the first or the second day he took sick -- except God kept him alive until the moment I arrive, and that's when he passed away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  What happened to your family then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  In that time, my father was extremely well-to-do. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He had good days and bad days. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">But in that time, so happened that he had horses and chickens and, and, and, and cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And the day he died, before the age of 12 or about, I suddenly became the old man of the family, and I had to take care not only of five grown-up sisters of mine and a constantly sick mother, but I had to take care of four horses and six cows and 12 chickens and porcupines. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I had my own porcupine, who was still in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And I had to take care of all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And it was a little too much for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">My older sister happened to have had escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> to deep <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> in the First World War, and she came back as a returnee. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">She had a husband and two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">All three of them died from hunger in her presence, so she was mentally slightly touched off. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And when I decided to sell all the cows and all the horses and everything, to liquidate the properties, she became disturbed, and she grabbed a knife, and she was ready to stab me. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And I escaped and came to the capital, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , where one of my sisters was married by then already, and I stayed with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And from there on, I developed myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  How old were you when you moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Well, that happened within a period of a few weeks or a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So I was about 14 -- 13 to 14 when that incident happened, and I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  And once you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> ? * </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Rabbi (Yiddish)
ANSWER:  I stayed for a little while with my married sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And after that, I got myself a job as a messenger boy in different <span class="BUILDING">retail outlets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And from there on, I, I kept building my life the best way I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">All my other sisters were single, and they all had boyfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And all their boyfriends were ready to marry them except they refused to marry them without getting the dowry, which was the custom in the Jewish tradition in those days, which was called nadn.” </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And without nadn, they weren't ready to marry them. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We helped marry off my first sister by issuing "veksels,””” which is promissory notes, of five thousand dollars for the two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> which we owned. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Both <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were connected to each other, and there was a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> where we kept the cows and the horses in between the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> so you could walk from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">It was a valuable property in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So the promissory notes that we had, first my mother and I had to sign up to my first brother-in-law, otherwise he would not have married my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And he kept the notes in his -- under his pillow in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So with the conniving of my married sister, we took out the notes from him and we gave it to the boyfriend of my second sister, and he married her. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">From thereon, we repeatedly did that all the time until all my sisters were married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And when you were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , as you got older, what different kinds of jobs did you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Since I didn't had any schooling; it was forbidden while I was a yeshiva bokher to educate myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And we were living eight boys in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , for the sole purpose that the boys should spy on each other, or not one of the boys should do something wrong illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And reading a book in any language other than the Gemara was a illegal deed. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So I had to have a candle, a lighted candle, covered with my blanket in order to read literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And I tried to study, to educate myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I gave up the study in yeshiva, because a student relative of mine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilkomir</span> , by the name of Yankel Zibutz (ph) smuggled me in the life of Baruch Spinoza and Israel Acosta (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And when I was finished reading those two books under the candlelight covered in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> at night, in the danger of burning down the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I realized that to be a yeshiva bokher and continue is not for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I became a educated skeptic, and I gave up the study. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And by then, my father died and it happened what it happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So without any trade, I was too young for any trade or any occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So I was getting jobs in <span class="BUILDING">retail outlets</span> to make deliveries, and I joined up a Yiddish cultural night school, where they was teaching people who didn't had the elementary schooling to be educated in the -- at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And that is my -- what I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">After working for several <span class="BUILDING">retail outlets</span> , I finally got myself a job in a office supply retail outlet by a childless couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And they, more or less, treated me like their own child. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And I grew up with them, and became a adult with those people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Can you tell me what happened as you moved into your 20s? ” </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Dowry (Hebrew) 0 Promissory note, IOU (Yiddish)
ANSWER:  As I moved into my 20s ... I -- being engaged in a <span class="BUILDING">office products company</span> , and where the Lithuanian intellectuals, under the leadership of the priests and the, and the educated people started a tremendous antisemitic hate campaign towards the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And the <span class="BUILDING">office products company</span> were the first victims, because it was only and primarily the government institutions like the Foreign Ministry and the Diplomatic Ministry and the Internal Ministry, and all the other government agencies who were the prime customers of the <span class="BUILDING">office supply companies</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And the government and the fascist Siauliaitist party kept sending pickets to picket some of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> so gentiles should not come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And the government instructions was not to buy from Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I attempted, with the help of the proprietors of the company, to do something in that respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I took a trip to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aniksht</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And there, I discussed with a gentile former childhood friend of mine by the name of Jonas Kovalisch (ph), and I encouraged him to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> and to buy out the existing <span class="BUILDING">retail outlet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And he lined up a, a, another gentile gentleman by the name of Jonas Svinkeviches (ph), who was a former publisher of the, of dictionaries and other books, and was not engaged in that time in any business. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And the two of them bought out the company, and it became a pure Christian company. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And they became extremely successful because all the agencies of the government institutions immediately start to buy from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I still remained with the company as a inside man in the, in the closed, in the -- in the locked -- locked <span class="INT_SPACE">inside quarters</span> , far away from the eye of the public. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And yet, the very same purchasing agents of the very same government agencies who were placing the orders, refused to deal with the pure Lithuanian Christian employees, and they dealt only with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  And this was shortly before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  That was up until 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">In 1933, it became more and more difficult, and my position with the company became more and more difficult because people didn't stay in their job very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">People got old. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">People got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They moved away. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So new employees came in the purchasing departments, and they didn't want to be bothered with buying, with, with taking care of, with me helping them take care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So my position became more or less obsolete. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So Jonas Kowalisch (ph) decided, with my consent, that instead of keeping me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> on the job which I had no, no, no purpose anymore and there was no way how I could get any other existence, he decided to send me on a trip to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Since the relationship was so good with all the government agencies, he made me make an appointment with the protocol chief of the Foreign Ministry in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And when I had the appointment with that gentlemen, he told me, "David, I'll give you diplomatic papers that you are a diplomatic courier. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I'll give you two suitcases, where you'll deliver to the <span class="BUILDING">Lithuanian Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> -- or to the <span class="BUILDING">Lithuanian Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And you will travel as a diplomatic courier, and you'll be able to get a visa and come in to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">If I will not have -- and I certainly will not have -- any documents to send it to you -- with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I will put in newspapers and fill it in." </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I got a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I arrived to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I delivered the two suitcases to the <span class="BUILDING">Consul General</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">Lithuanian Consul General</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And I went to my, my family from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedford Hills</span> picked me up, and I stayed there for a short period of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  But then you went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  No, I did not go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And then, when my immigration, when my visa time expired, I discovered that if you have fifty dollars in your pocket, you can take any transportation and arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> without any documents, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , without any visas or any documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Or maybe they did require some kind of a paper where you would get where you get it in the, in the <span class="BUILDING">Portuguese Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I had the fifty dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I arranged everything, and I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and two weeks later, I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And I attempt to get established over there, to build up my existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  Um-hm, and what happened then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  After a while -- by then it was already closer to 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">After a while, the sit- the situation in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , particularly <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and the three <span class="REGION">Baltic states</span> -- <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span> -- became extremely dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Vul-vulnerable from Hitler's part and from Stalin's part. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Those three <span class="REGION">Baltic countries</span> are like a little kitten squeezed in between a lion and a hippopotamus. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And I felt that my five sisters -- I'm sorry -- by then it was only four sisters, because one of my brother-in-laws, my youngest sister Hanke (ph), was a leftist activist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was a fascist government under the rule of President Smetona.'' </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And he was in danger to be arrested and be imprisoned for a long, long time -- escaped to <span class="REGION">South America</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And three, four months after he arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> , he sent papers for my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So the two of them were in <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So I was left with four sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I realized that if anything happens, anything dramatic happens to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , all my four sisters, with all their four husbands -- each of them had four or five children -- and with all their children -- and my mother, my mother must have been 70 years by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They will be destroyed in 10 minutes after anything happened, without me and my supervision and my ability to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So I voluntarily left <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> to be with my family.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  Were you trying at that point to get your family out of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  There was no way how to make any attempt to get out the family of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">The whole world was closed for Lithuanian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">As a matter of fact, the day of the ti -- the day of the out-outbreak of the war between Hitler and Stalin, there were there were extremely wealthy Jews walking around with foreign passports and foreign visas to go in any part of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And they couldn't go because <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> wouldn't let them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And the consul of the prospective <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , who gave out the visas because of decency and humane reasons, knew before he gave them the visas that those <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> wouldn't let them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">There was no way for me to attempt to take out my family or myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I came in to the, to the, to the -- voluntarily from a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> to this situation, because I knew that my family would not have survived any difficulty without me. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">But to attempt to get out, there was no way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  Can you tell me what happened when the war started, when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="217">What happened to you in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  What happened to me 1s, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilijampole</span> , where my sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilijampole</span> , where my sister lived was the heart of the Jewish poor population in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">The popularity -- the population- was mostly Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">All the great famous <span class="BUILDING">yeshivas</span> were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And when the war broke out, it took three days and three nights that the German were not able to step in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> and in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , because the fronts were going on fightings between the Russian Army and the German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">But the civil Russian popula-- government in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> , including <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilijampolis</span> , disintegrated within a half a day of the first outbreak of the war, which was the night of June 21st, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">In those three days and three nights, with the Russian might disappeared suddenly within one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">All the functionaries of the Russian government and Party had their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and other means of transportation stacked away somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And when it happened, they all packed up their families and they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And the population was left without any mercy at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And it's the Lithuanian fascists, who were prepared for all the time since the Russian rule was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , secretly, by the Nazi agents to have uniforms and ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So the first half a hour after the outbreak of the war that there was no more Russian might, the Lithuanian fascists -- they called themselves Siauliaitists or Siaulitists (ph), I don't know exactly -- the very same organization who before the war was doing all the anti-Jewish activities, they were within one half an hour in uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And they marched in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobodka</span> ; and they murdered the most brutal, the most unbelieved inhumanely torturous way almost all the population, the Jewish population, in that community. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I was supposed to be there, too, and I was supposed to be murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And I know that there's no reason why I would have a better human being than everybody, where all my friends were murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Except for one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Being a volun -- free. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Being a independent representative in the <span class="DLF">office products field</span> , where I was selling to the <span class="BUILDING">retail outlets</span> and I had a tremendous fine relationship with all the employees in the <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> with whom I did business. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And one of the <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> , the employee manager — a, a Jewish girl by the name of Hinda — Hindale (ph), she was a member of the Communist Party. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">She was a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist Party. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And as soon as the Communist, Communist rule took over the power in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> -- that was about 1940, about a year prior to the outbreak of the war -- she called me. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">It's about a week and a half, about a week prior to the start of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">She called me that there's a meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and my name was put on to be sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">For months and months and months, or weeks and weeks, the secret police used to ring the bell in the, in the most of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> , pack them up, send them to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and send them to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">There was no way of telling who will be next to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Since of my attitude being extremely polished and friendly with everybody, one of these, one of the highest activists of the Communist Party was constantly imprisoned by the Lithuanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And he was a, a -- and his background was the office product industry, and his family was known. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And Hindale was the one who was collecting money from me to support his family, and to support other families, and the other of the imprisoned political prisoners, Jewish or non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I gave to everybody generously, so she knew exactly who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And there were a great deal of members of the Central Committee of the Communist Pa -- Kovno Lithuanian Communist Party, who also knew about my activities as a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And she called me and informed me that I am on the list to be taken to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">There was a mi-- a, a minority rule vote against taking me out, but the majority won. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And she suggested to me that the person from whose family I helped support -- I don't know his name, he became the head of the rectory of the vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">He became the Commissioner of the head of the vacation for the whole commercial enterprises in <span

healthy for me to be a free-lance representative, so they appointed a job for me in one of the <span class="BUILDING">retail outlets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I became the prekiau (ph) zinaviets’~ (ph) -- the merchandise specialist. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">So she suggested to me I thought I should call that gentleman and ask him to grant me a vacation, because I didn't feel good. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I called him in his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> , I made an appointment with him the same day to have dinner with him in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I explained to him that I don't feel good. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I happen physically to suffer from psoriasis. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And all I had to do is unroll my sleeve and scratch a little in my, in my, in my joint area that 1t becomes white, to convince him that I am what I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And he saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">He called me the next day, and suggested that there's two openings for me on vacation. </span><span

ANSWER:  When the war broke out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  When the war broke out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  Since I was a fairly well-to-do person, and without a family, as soon as the Communists took over <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , everybody in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , every -- but everybody had to look like Stalin, to make themselves a Stalin jacket and high boots, and pants with, with -- how do you call it? '* </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Molotov, Vyachelslav (1890-1986) Rider pants, whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So I, I had tailor-made luxury black ankle leather coats, with high boots, with Stalinuvka’” (ph) jackets. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And at the ttme when Molotov's speech was delivered, the tens of thousands of vacationers, they're starting to run around in chaotic -- a mad situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And nobody know what to do, and nobody knew where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And I immediately decided that I will start to escape in the only <span class="DLF">highway road</span> which was near the <span class="REGION">resort area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And I walked out with my beautiful black raincoat, dressed in the beautiful boots to look like a commissar. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And after 10, 15 minutes walking, my feet were already crippled, and I had to throw away the boots and walk barefoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I walked for an hour this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">While passing by -- that was in the middle of the night -- there was a <span class="DLF">water well</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And thousands of people were laying around the <span class="DLF">water well</span> , hanging around. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">There was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of Russian students. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I don't remember what kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">It was a <span class="BUILDING">vocational school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And the boys who were who were taking out the water from the <span class="DLF">well</span> wore uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And the thousands of people had stretched out their hands to get a drink of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I had some properties with me, and in the properties I had built in two very, very expensive diamonds. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I prepared myself for that kind of even-eventuality in many situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">In, in a dry shaving soap container, like a little, like a little roller. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And I took that out and stretched out my hand to hand over to the boys; and within two seconds, I got the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And I continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Daybreak came, and by then I was half-dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I couldn't walk anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I was on a <span class="DLF">field</span> where thousands of people were laying stretched out on the <span class="DLF">field</span> , already half-dead from the same difficulty of walking barefoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German airplanes</span> came flying over the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And a lot of people were shoving themselves through their bodies crawling, with the hope that they will be able to crawl closer to the bombs and get killed so they die, but it didn't happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And it just so happened that by then I was near a <span class="DLF">road</span> where thousands of refugees were running towards <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">That <span class="DLF">highway</span> was closer to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Those <span class="DLF">borders</span> , in those days, the, the, the, the <span class="REGION">national territories</span> that a little, a little <span class="DLF">highway</span> , a little <span class="DLF">road</span> -- here was <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , five seconds later it was <span class="COUNTRY">Ukrainia</span> , and, and a little bit further it was <span class="COUNTRY">Byelorussia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">It was all part of the same <span class="REGION">territories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So I happened to be lying near the, the route, near the <span class="DLF">road</span> , where a Jewish family with a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> , with some children and women were on the, on the, on the, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and men were walking with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And one of the women noticed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And she started to cry and forced the man to put me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , they bandaged my feet and powdered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And I recuperated. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And after traveling all day and almost a half a night, wherever we went the Germans were ahead of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Finally we land up a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">We were 1n a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> of a, of a <span class="BUILDING">Ukrainian farmer house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">It was then already forbidden by Jews to take in wandering Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So the Ukrainian had mercy with us and took us in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And I remember if it happened today, right now, that his two grown-up sons were busy in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> robbing the Jewish properties. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And the old man -- he must have been eighty, ninety years old -- stood for hours in the <span class="DLF">doorway</span> of his <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> where we were laying, with a, with a stick like a baseball stick over his shoulder, ready to beat his sons when they'll be > Stalinka jackets. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">finished robbing the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and when they will come back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to stop them from going in in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and kill us and take away the properties what those people had with whom I was attached. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I had no properties again at all anymore, so there was nothing to take from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">All they could do is kill me. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">After we left this <span class="REGION">property</span> , we continued riding further and further and further. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And we didn't manage to go very far, where we stopped at another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And I, I was relaxed already and almost everything in my foot healed, except one <span class="REGION">area</span> which was bleeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And I was sitting in the front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I think the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the people in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> what made me do something in the front -- clean a pot, I don't remember what. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And a group of German soldiers stopped and asked me, "Du Jude?"'</span><span class="sentence" id="344">° And I said, "Jude." </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And they took me with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They took me to a, to a, to a, to a fairly decent-looking <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And it was vacant, and they made me scrub the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">It was the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> for the commanding general to stopover when he will arrive. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">They were preparing the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And since one of the guards noticed my bleeding foot, they called in the military doctor and he bandaged my foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">In the meantime, he bought something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And after I was finished cleaning, they took me back to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they picked me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">By then, it was too late to go anywhere, because the <span class="DLF">routes</span> were bombed and destroyed and the Germans were everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So the family, the family from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> to whom I attached myself, decided to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And it took us several days. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Shortly before we came to the proper <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> , there was the gendarmes, the military gendarmes, who were controlling the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">traffic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And they stepped -- they stopped us and identified a whole group as Jews and took us straight to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And from there, they kept us for a day or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And since the whole family was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> , resident family, they let them all go -- including me. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So I stayed for a few days with that family. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Shortly afterwards, few -- I rested for a day or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And then I -- they told me -- I spoke no Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">So the family with whom I was staying discovered that there are thousands of refugees are lined up in the front of the German commandant to get passes to go back to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Where do you have that many thousands of refugees? </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Druskininkai</span> , the <span class="REGION">resort area</span> where I was, was a resort area only for, for vacationers. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">There were dozens of <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> only for vacationers. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And there were many other <span class="BUILDING">resort hotels</span> in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So thousands, and maybe tens of thousands of Russian laborers and employees who had a vacation lined up over there and were caught in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And they all lined up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> , in the front of the Kommandantur to get passes to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And I did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">The procedure was: there was a big <span class="DLF">street</span> , no traffic, it was blocked off; across the <span class="DLF">street</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Kommandantur</span> , the thousands of people were staying and waiting in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">There were several German guards who controlled the traffic of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And when a group of 10, 20 people walked out from the Kommandantur, that means they took care of their business. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">The guards permitted a group of these other 10, 20 people to go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Since thousands of people were waiting on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the guard doesn't designate who should come in, so the thousands of them was starting to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So the guards '° “Are You a Jew?” (</span><span class="sentence" id="378">German) were controlling the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">They let that many people in, and they did not permit any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And the rest of them went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">That repeated itself several times a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I was there for one day, and I think a second day. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">After that, the rule came out that every Jew should wear a Star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And the Grodno family made up Stars of David on the front and on the back, and they made a set of Star of Davids for me, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So the next morning, six o'clock in the morning, I arrived at the, at the line<span class="BUILDING">-up place</span> , already with my Star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I am not a tall person. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And between the husky big people without the Star of David, I would never had a opportunity to get there because as groups of people got their, their fulfillment, new groups of people arrived to wait for the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">A day passed by. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Although nobody ever attempted to offend me at all, while I was standing, but when I started to run with all the other people to get in, that's when they pushed me aside and did not let me go near it. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And one day, I think, two days passed by. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Early morning on the third day, when I lined up together with all the other people, the German guard walked over to me and said, "Du, Jude, komm.""’ </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And he walked me through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , and while walking he said to me, "Die Schweine, die, die, die Russians! </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Ich hab gesehen was ist — was angeht, und du hast niemals die Gelegenheit durchzugehen." </span><span class="sentence" id="394">6
QUESTION:  Can you translate that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">ANSWER:  I was the only Jew with the Star of David waiting for a permission to go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And he realized there's so much going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And he walked me through the Kommandantur. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I walked in, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> , and the officer was sitting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And I explained to him in German that I'm, I'm going to the Kommandantur to ask a permit to go back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And he told me to go on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , I'll see the people there, I'll know where to go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And I did walk in, and my turn came after a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And another elderly German officer was sitting at, at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , and he and a civilian Pole was standing next to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Since all the applicants for permission to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> were not Poles -- they were Russian and Ukrainian, and all, all other people and all nationalities. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Poles had no need to ask permission to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because that was their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So, naturally, the Commandant had an interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And I was the only Jew who came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And the Polish interpreter attempted immediately to explain the Commandant, in his broken Pol—German - that I am a Communist and I should be shot right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">My ear was very clear then. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I stood up like, like "Achtung!" -- </span><span class="sentence" id="410">you know, like "Attention!" -- </span><span class="sentence" id="411">and I said to the Commandant, "Der Mann ligt! </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Ich bin ein, ein, ein -- ich bin hier ftir Erholung in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Druskininkai</span> , und bin in dem middle auf dem Ausbruch, auf dem Krieg, von Kovno, <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuanien</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Und ich bitte dem Commandant erlauben es zuriickziehen nach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> ."’” </span><span class="sentence" id="414">The man took a look at me, picked up his stamp, stamped on a paper, and out I was.

QUESTION:  We’re ready to go back on. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">We left off with your getting permission to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">ANSWER:  I went back to the family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">They, they gave me a little food to go, and the next day in the morning I started off to go on foot towards <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , which people suggested the route I should take. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">There's not traffic. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I was the only one going on that <span class="DLF">route</span> , and no walkers, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I was just by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I walked all day long and rested for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">It was -- by then, it was in mid-- in mid-July, and it was extremely hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And from time to time, I rested. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I became thirsty, but I had nowhere out to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And towards the evening, I arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">There wasn't even any <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> where to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">But that was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And they gave me something to eat and they gave me to drink, and I continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And late at night I arrived back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Druskininkai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">From there, I started off. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And by then, was already a rule issued by the German authorities that no local resident should be permitted to take in a strange Jew in their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , under the penalty of death. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Then I stretched out on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> , laying there ready to die, whatever will happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I was extremely exhausted from the walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I was already again hungry and thirsty. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And early in the morning -- I laid all night like that -- and early in the morning, at time when people were beginning to move around, there were two Jewish girls from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> who were also vacationing. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">They were nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I think they were sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And they saw me laying on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="449">They recognized me. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">They came over, and they cried dramatically over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">But they couldn't help me, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">But they brought me some water, and something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And I strengthened myself a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And after a while, I was laying there again. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I didn't have the strength to get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And two girls passed by. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And they passed me -- Christian girls -- they passed me by laughing and giggling. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And while they passed me by, one of them made a remark. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I don't remember why the remark was. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And they came back, and that one girl recognized me. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">In the good days, prior -- about a year, a year and a half ago, when Hitler attacked <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , thousands of Polish Jewish refugees find themselves in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And one person from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , whom I became very friendly and sheltered him and helped him economically and to survive, happened to be a playboy. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And he -- the girls were clinging to him like, like honey to a bee, and he had dates constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And since I was a single fellow, too, we had dates together. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And I remember one weekend he arranged a date for me with two gentile girls whose sister was married to a Jewish musician in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And we had a beautiful evening together; but that was about a year ago of the time that I was laying on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And my date, one of the two girls we had a date, was that girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">How do you like that?! </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And she happened to be the sister of the Lithuanian chief of the organized partisan murderous bands, who were busy in that time not to bother with the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Because 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish Ukrainian villages</span> , the Lithuanian partisans who take over the power immediately were busy antagonizing or robbing or murdering the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">They had not -- they didn't have to bother with the Jews, because the Jews wouldn't run away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">They had time plenty for the Jews later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">But her brother was the head of the organizers of the murderous partisan bands, who for participated in most of the destructive murders of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno-</span> including <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobodka</span> , primarily <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobodka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Where if I would have been there, what I started to explain you originally. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">By all counts I should have been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">But because physically I happened to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Druskininkai</span> , so I wasn't murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So he brought me in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  And then what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Then they gave me to eat and to drink, and they gave me some clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And he was getting ready to send a transport of additional murderers to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , to continue with the beautiful work they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And he instructed them to put me in the

id="483">And he instructed them, and he had told me, that on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> they will be stopped by a German officer who was the real head chief of the, of the, of the

speak Lithuanian, and the Lithuanian didn't speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">But he will give them instructions what, additional instructions what to do in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Prior to this stop, where he was supposed to wait for them, the soldiers should put me underneath their feet between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> arranged for people to sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And they should cover me up with their feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And he explained me, too -- or his sister explained me -- that it will be stopped, and a German officer will talk German. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I should not breath or make any sign of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I should stay still. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And I did, and they passed by. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">The trip was a pretty long trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">It was almost a whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Towards the evening, they stopped in the front of a, of a <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> , or a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , where they all went in to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And they took me in, too, and I ate with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">When they arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , on <span class="DLF">Vilna Street</span> -- one of the main <span class="DLF">streets</span> -- they just let me off. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I'm finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I'm finished, I -- their duty was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">That <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was not far of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where my brother-in-law's brother was living. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So I walked in in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , in their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And there I find my sister with her two children, and my mother, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jonava</span> , with a niece of mine -- the one who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And there they -- I discovered the whole the whole story what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I would have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobodka</span> , in my sister's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And they avoid that the brutal murder of the pogroms on the first three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">On the fourth day, a group of partisans, murderous, decided to go and check out from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">My sister happened to have lived in a <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">So the eight, nine men who were hiding were up there in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> -- my brother-in-law, his brother, his son and other people -- they're hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">It was not the straight down <span class="DLF">roof</span> where you could fold up. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">It was a <span class="DLF">attic roof</span> like <span class="REGION">areas</span> were straight, where people could lay down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">After they didn't find anybody, they all walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And some of the idiots <span class="NPIP">inside</span> decided to look from, on the ” Task force (German) balcony, decided to look if it's all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And the last partisan decided to look up, and they met each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And they took them all down, and they took them to the <span class="BUILDING">Ninth Fortification</span> .”' </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And they murdered them, together with most of the Jews that were murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">You have to remember that this <span class="DLF">Fortification</span> , the Seventh and the Ninth Fortification, was fortifications -- you know what a <span class="DLF">fortification</span> is? </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Built by the <span class="REGION">Czarist Russia</span> to pretend -- to prevent -- attacks from German armies in, in 1905. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And they were still in existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And the Lithuanian took them over, and that's where they murdered most of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">They took them there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">QUESTION:  What, what happens to you next, now that you're back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="523">ANSWER:  The next, the next thing what happened, I happened to have an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">My mother, when I made the trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Druskininkai</span> for a vacation, my mother was living with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">She was taking care of the maid I had, and helping her. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I didn't want my mother to be by herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">So I gave her money to buy gifts for all her daughters, and travel to visit from one daughter to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And the first stop she made was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jonava</span> , with my sister who had fou-four children. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Over there, the first day the Jews were lined up from their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , driven to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and they were kept for several days. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">My then-70-years-old mother realized that nothing good will come out from the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And she grabbed Dinah's (ph) hand -- my oldest niece, my sister's oldest daughter -- and she pushed herself closer and closer to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And when it became dark, she pulled out Dinah and they walked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">They were hiding during the day in the, in the, in the ravinas (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Ravina, that's a English word? </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Between the -- and during the night, they were walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">A woman who couldn't read and write, never went to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , never know what a map means, managed to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Janova</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And that's how they arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">They were hiding during the day, because they would have been caught by the partisans and murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And if there weren't any partisans, some of the decent Christians would have fingered them to the partisans and called over a murderer. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So they arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So I had already a built-in family of my sister Chayke (ph), whose husband was murdered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobodka</span> , with her little girl, Raisele (ph), and a boy, Alenke (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="542">The boy was six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">The girl was about 12, 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">That was three people. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">My mother is four, and Dinahle (ph) then is five. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So I had five dependents, on whose ability to survive depends on me only. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">After a while, the rule came out to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I, on the other hand, the minute when I heard what happened to my brother- in-law and their, and the, the other people -- and that had happened only three, four days before my arrival. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Because they didn't murder them in the first three days of the onslaught. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">It was on the fourth day; and it was three -- it was seven days since the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I decided to walk to the <span class="BUILDING">criminal police headquarters</span> to attempt to speak to this chief of the criminal police, Mr. Pomatitis (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="552">My relationship with Pomatitis was as following: while I was the manager, so-called *! </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Ninth Fort manager of the new Christian office products store and his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was buying, and he personally was coming and place orders for me for 5,000 dollar carpets and other expensive properties and put in on the invoice "office products" to be sent to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , it was a personal relationship between him and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Since I wasn’t some several times for business, and when I became the employee of the <span class="BUILDING">government store</span> retail outlet, after the, the Communists took over, because I had to have a job, his wife was coming to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to buy school supplies for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">So she told me that he was imprisoned in the <span class="BUILDING">Kovno prison</span> , and I realized that they had difficulty to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So I gave her money to buy the school supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I helped her with food, and I sent quite often hilf* -- help -- to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">My logic was, that when he was rel-- freed from <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> from the Communists, and became again the chief of the <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , my logic was that she would have told him what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">He knew who I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And I think I'll take the, I'll take the risk and go to see him, and ask him if he can liberate my brother-in-law and all the people who were kept in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And that's what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">In order to be secure, because it wasn't safe to walk through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> for the Lithuanian partisans who didn't know who I am and didn't care who I am, I had a distant relative -- a Jewish distant relative -- who was a former volunteer in the original Lithuanian Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And that was a big honor by the Lithuanians, and he wore a little button on his--. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">With that, we were stopped a couple times going to the, to the police, to this. -- </span><span class="sentence" id="565">to the chief of police, to Mr. Pomatitis, which was all the way on the, on the, on the new part in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , quite a distant. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">But we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">There were thousands of Jews waiting in the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> for appointments, and hundreds and hundreds of Lithuanian and other minorities who were waiting for their appointment. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">But when I informed the desk clerk that I came to see Mr. Jonas Pomatitis, the chief of the <span class="BUILDING">police headquarters</span> , within two seconds the assistant of the police, chief of police of Mr. Pomatitis came out and asked me my business, and I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">He went back in; and came out and regretted that Mr. Pomatitis does not have the opportunity to come and speak to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">But he'll do everything he can, but he thinks 1t may be too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And that's exactly what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">It was too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">On the way back, we were stopped again by Lithuanian partisans, who were picking up Jews from all <span class="NPIP">over</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">It was still permitted for Jews to walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , but you had to have your star already. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Or maybe by then it was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">But it wasn't hard for a Lithuanian to know who is a Jew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">They looked at the at the little button of my friend, and they pushed him away; and they took me to the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , to the yellow <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , which was nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">They kept me there for several hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And then, with a group of hundreds of other Jews, they took me on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> in a former Russian caserne, a military unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And they made me sort clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And when the day was over, they sent me back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Then the decree came out that all Jews should go in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ; and I made arrangements with my family to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Since we had -- didn't have anything to transfer, it was for easier for us just to go <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">She lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobodka</span> , where it was supposed to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">The <span class="DLF">street</span> she lived was supposed to be part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Before we did that, I decided to go ** Help (Yiddish). </span><span class="sentence" id="588">to my former <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and see if there was anything I could recuperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">The superintendent of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was a Russian, a old Russian with a big beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Nobody persecuted Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">The Lithuanian had a anger against Poles because of the war between them for so many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">But the Russian were, were kept neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Nobody -- the old ones, and not new Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">They were regular Lithuanian citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">When I walked in in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , a rifle was hanging on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And he explained me, "You see, I can easily take down the rifle and shoot you dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">But I'm not going to do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="598">He returned to me a pair of shoes and some underwear, and a loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Because I was extremely well-to-do, and because my friend was a former Polish immigrant, he arranged for me to buy from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> the most luxury <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Polish furniture</span> that only nobility could afford to have it -- or multi-millionaires. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">It was called tonnette (ph) manufacturing. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So he became the possessor of all the luxury, with everything I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And after a few days, we moved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">By then, my sister's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where she lived was not any more designated to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and we had to move in somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And since every Jew got something, so my family got also some kind of a location together with other Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">But in the meantime, we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was not completely closed up by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">But Jews were constantly moving in. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">The German authorities gave us, I think, until August 15th to close in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , where no more, no, no Jews would be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">It should be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Free should move in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I had a dear Lithuanian friend, a Chris, a Christian Lithuanian friend -- also a former assistant of mine -- by the name of Kostas (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And while I was preparing myself, I was not prepared that Stal-- Hitler will attack Stalin and overnight we will be finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">We were prepared that the Russians will take over <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> and stay aside watching Hitler fighting with <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and, and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and nothing will happen in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And since the Germans -- the Russians -- might will take over my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I was prepared with my, with my wealth that I could live for a thousand years by having packages of my properties in different <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> of different friends, Jewish and non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Whoever was my friends, I supported some of those families for a couple years, in order for them to -- while they are keeping my properties. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Because I figured out exactly and precisely, if anything should happen except the war between Hitler and Stalin, I would have enough to live for myself and for all the dozens of families who had my properties. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">When I say "myself," it's not “T’ personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">It's the five families of my, of my sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And that could have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I left with Kostas a box of British gold pens to be put in in fountain pens. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">In that time, there was no ball-points. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">It was only -- no ball-points. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">It was only pencils and pens. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I had a box about that big. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">In that box was a hundred boxes of a hundred pen in each box. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">If that property would have been converted successfully, at the time of the transfer from Russian might to German might to the private -- might, it would have been worth millions. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Because nobody could have refused a gold pen to put in in their fountain pen, to continue be able to write. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I left a whole box of that with Kostas. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And when I came, before I got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , to pick up from him -- I had dinner with him, and at dinner they served me with a broken fork and I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I took a droska’’ back and a droska forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">If I would have been caught riding a droska, I would have been shot on the <span class="REGION">premises</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">But I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I felt I had to do it, because by going in 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I thought I would be able to help myself survive for a long time with that, with that pens. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">You know what I'm talking about, that pen? </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Do you know what I'm saying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">ANSWER:  No, you don't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">QUESTION:  Like a fountain pen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  Like a foun-- a pen to be put in, in the fountain pen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">QUESTION:  That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Right, I understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">ANSWER:  The most treasured thing in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> was a fountain pen. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And the pen, the fountain pen, could not function without that pen. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I took in with, with the, with the properties. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And I immediately, the next day -- but immediately the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Most of the Jewish were permitted to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with all their properties, with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Some of them hired transportation -- horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> -- and came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with everything they had because the Nazis knew that everything the Jewish would bring 1n in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they'll get it later. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">It was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">The Jewish were not running from them anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">But I came in with nothing, with five mouths. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And the first meal you may manage, the second and the third. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">What you do with the fourth meal? </span><span class="sentence" id="655">So the following day, I immediately walked around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , where most of the people -- who had everything they needed for the first three, four weeks -- they're hiding, in order not to be captured to be taken to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Because there's no guarantee that you'll come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I was walking around looking to be captured, to be taken to work, because that was the only opportunity, by being at work outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> , that I may have somehow a possibility to have some kind of food to survive and to bring to my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">That was my motivation. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">A young member of the, of the same <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where I lived -- there were several families in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I think a young couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And he followed my footsteps, and he went with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">After walking for 10, 15 minutes, we naturally were captured by Lithuanian guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">One important factor I forgot to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Can I put it in now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">QUESTION:  At a time a when Jewish were still walking back and forth from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> *° Horse-drawn buggy. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">This could be a from a variety of languages: Russian, Polish, or German. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , to, to pick up their things and to bring, I decided one day also to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Maybe I would visit Jonas Petronis, my other Christian real friend, who offered me I should help in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And by then he had a <span class="BUILDING">retail book shop</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I thought I would visit him and take up a couple matters with him to discuss. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">There was a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobodka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And when I came near the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobod--</span> from the <span class="REGION">ghetto side</span> , from the <span class="REGION">Slobodka side</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , there was a Lithuanian untfor-- a Lithuanian guard with a rifle standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I didn't know who it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I know him standing there, but I didn't know who it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">When I came closer, he captured me. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">He was the son, the Yiddish- speaking son, of the Lithuanian superintendent in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where the family for whom I worked had purchased with the help of an American brother of the lady, a multi-millionaire, Mr. Israel Matz (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="678">So his father was the superintendent in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ; and he was the son of the superintendent -- who spoke Yiddish as good as I, or more better. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And he captured me. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And he shouted to call the guard from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And who was the guard on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="682">His older brother, who was my best friend while, while , while we were, we were on the, on the free <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And both of them decided in my presence, they were debating should they knock me off, throw me in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , not knock me off. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And both of them decided to let me go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So with that, I, I survived the first incident of destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Or, or that wasn't the first incident, but I survived that incident, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">The next morning, I went off with my friend to go to look for work and I was captured. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">We were taken to shant-- to the <span class="BUILDING">military casernes</span> which was a tremendous distant. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">We walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">When we arrived there, we were half-dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">It was about three, four hundred people altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">My friend and I was taken to a huge <span class="BUILDING">military barrack home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">We were given a, a emer --a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> -- and a brush, and we, we were taken to this to the water foun-- sink. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And we were told to take water, and lay down and scrub the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">We did. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">We scrubbed the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> until our knees were swollen and bloody. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">The Lithuanian, the Lithuanian murderous partisan who was in charge of us, every three or four hours came in to watch us. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">In the meantime, he murdered up -- he and his friends murdered up half of the Jewish over there because the Jewish didn't realize. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">They mistakenly believed that they are still dealing with human beings, and tried to persuade them not to have them work so hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And the slightest request of resentment or opposition to the hard work, they immediately took them out and murdered them. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I didn't have that case. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I laid down on my knees, and I rubbed and scrubbed and rubbed and scrubbed. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And the young man who was with me did exactly the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">That affected so much the murderous Christian Lithuanian guard that he himself run around to the <span class="BUILDING">Lithuanian houses</span> and begged food from them, got food from them, came in and throw it on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> for us to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">When we were finished with that, five o'clock we were lined up and we arrived back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">It just so happened that the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> we got, they are the <span class="REGION">territory</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> of the poorest non-sufficient Jewish, who are worth any, nothing to the, to the Jewish administration anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">But value nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And that's where we got the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So there was a long <span class="DLF">desert</span> to walk, a desert area, a sandy area, to walk to our <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Quiet * Pail (Yiddish). </span><span class="sentence" id="712">walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">We were half-dead already, by the way, while we're arriving. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">When we arrived at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , there was already a organized a Ghettowache~ who were checking the <span class="DLF">gates</span> for the Jewish who came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And there was a organized Jewish police community guards, who were guarding on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , on the inside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettowache</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">The cooperation between the murderous guards and the Jewish guards after a while became pretty, pretty decent, pretty tolerant after a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">The rule had came out already then by the chief Gestapo commander of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that every Jew who meets a German executive -- civilian or military -- has to bow and take off the hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">When we walked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettowache</span> , we were told to be careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">If we will meet a German, we should bow and take off our hats if we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">We didn't have hats then. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">So we're walking halfway. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">We are starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And a Jew was not supposed to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> , so we didn't walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And we were walking already in the desert area when suddenly, from a <span class="DLF">corner street</span> , two guards, two armed German military men came out walking towards us. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">When we came close enough to them, we bowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And they immediately took down their rifles to shoot at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And I immediately figured out what's going on, what their thought was. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">If I would turn around and run back, they would shoot us right away because they would understand that I'm running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">There's no way how I could run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So I immediately start running backwards, for them to know that my intentions are good, and the other man followed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">After walking backwards 10, 15 steps and we came to their presence, we bowed very deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And they laughed and walked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And then, after a while, we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and relaxed and, and had a little to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I think the guards -- the Lithuanian, whom, for whom we worked -- gave us some food to take along with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And this way, every day I was going out, without waiting for anybody to line up and without waiting to be captured. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">That young man and I were walking out every morning, and we were waiting to be to be, we were looking for the opportunity to be caught and be taken outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where, where eventually we would have had something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">The first day, I was taken to a German military unit, to the <span class="BUILDING">PX canteen</span> , to wash the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> there and to help put the merchandise on the shelves. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">When we arrived there, the manager of the <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> -- the German officer, the Christian German-speaking officer in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> -- took the two of us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">canteen room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="739">The <span class="INT_SPACE">canteen room</span> was a little like a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> as, as, as big as that corer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">He put the pail of water in the front of the <span class="DLF">door</span> , so when somebody would try to get in they would have to move the pail of water or, or know that it's something there. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">He was able to see who would come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">If it's something that he's afraid of, he would open the <span class="DLF">door</span> right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And if it was somebody not important, he would tell them that the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> is wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And immediately gave us food to eat, and told us if anything will try to get in in the <span class="DLF">door</span> and he will tell us to remove the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> , we should put the food in a corner nobody, not, not to be seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And after eating, we cleaned up everything exactly and precisely, and he invited us for a few more days to come. *</span><span class="sentence" id="746">° Ghetto watch (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And I had a beautiful, comfortable existence for my family and for other people after, for a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Then that was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And I started again, and, and after three, four days being in bad <span class="REGION">areas</span> where I had to come back with almost nothing to eat, I lined to work for the Third Police Brigade in the center of the most luxury area in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And I was working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> peeling potatoes, and, and, and doing all kind of manual work. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And I had enough to food to, to eat, and I had enough food to bring for the family and for other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">By then, it must have been already mid, mid, mid, mid -- by end of August, where everything settled in. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">In the early stages, where it was still permitted to go outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , a great deal of Jewish young men from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slobodka ghetto</span> -- it was easy to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jonava</span> because the <span class="DLF">highway</span> was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">They're running out every morning to go and get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="755"><span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> (ph), the chief murderer of the Gestapo, was waiting for them right by the end of the trip and murdered them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">That was going on for three, four days, until some goyim”’ -- decent goyim -- were able to come and to tell the Jewish not to go there, because they lined them up and they murdered them on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I was approached several times by very good friends of mine to go with them and buy food. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I didn't had any money or any clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Immediately thereafter the creation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , clothing was the commodity to exchange. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I didn't had any. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">What my superintendent returned to me was not enough for anything -- just a pair of shoes and a pair of socks, and some underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">So I had no reason to go, and that's why I survived this murderous onslaught. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">When I lined up in the, in the <span class="BUILDING">Third Police Precinct</span> , I think by reading the other memories I know that it was Captain Tornbaum”’ who was in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">After three, four days working there, the, the, the chief himself, the chef himself, for whom we were actually working and giving us instructions, didn't bother with us one day or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">He gave us the instructions; we did them. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">He gave us to eat, and, and he had nothing to do with us one way or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">But one day, some more soldiers came to us, took one other man and me on a, on a, on a step on a <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> in, in one of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and took us over to a corner where two huge sacks of sugar was standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">He instructed us to take the sacks, to bring them to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I immediately came over to the sack and started to grab it, and grabbed and grabbed and grabbed, and I couldn't even get near the sack. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And the other guy started to argue with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">It's too heavy for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">So he told me, "Stay here." </span><span class="sentence" id="773">He walked over to him, slapped him around several times, and he grabbed the sack and run down like, like, like anything, came back with him upstairs, dragged my sack and they came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Because that that, that soldier realized that I couldn't even , even, even, even wrap around the sack. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And that was the end of the incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">After a while, it organized work brigades for the Jewish to go to the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> working. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">The best units were in the <span class="REGION">area</span> where I was working, because there were a lot of, the complete population was filled up with Lithuanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">They immediately took over the luxury °° Gentiles (Yiddish). “</span><span class="sentence" id="779">7 Captain Alfred Tornbaum apartments from the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And they immediately started to peddle with the Jewish, bartering food for clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And the Germans there, after, after a while getting used to the way of their slaves, probably keep their eye closed or didn't bother or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">It was going on a, a business like a regular business. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Clothing became a very expensive commodity to take out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">But the black marketeers, to them bring in food was not such a big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">To them was important to buy expensive food -- like saccharine. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">You know what saccharine is? </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Sweeteners. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Or sugar or fat or butter. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And that, at one time or another, it was pretty comfortable to get in, bring it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">But after a while, it became extremely, extremely dangerous to bring in food of any value. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And in that time, the German Nazis put up a Lithuanian Wachmeister~> who was a tall, slim person. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">By five o'clock in the afternoon, the <span class="DLF">street</span> to enter <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> was lined up with thirty-five thousand Jews -- everyone broken down by their brigades, lined up five in a row to march in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> after a day's work. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">That Wachmeister was purposely hired to catch the black marketeers. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I had a contract in the work brigade, in that time, with a strong Jewish, physically strong Jew by the name of Chaimke Lipman (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="795">He was extremely strong, powerful man. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I was buying a sack of potatoes, because a sack of potatoes was a tool for me to bring in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> , by then a lot of people who were brought in some food were already starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">So by then it was already seven, eight months, or five, stx months in the existence of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And things changed dramatically. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And the el-- the elderly people who couldn't go out to work were giving their clothes to the black marketeers to bring, to bring in food for them they to have something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And that Wachmeister had a certain morality in his own frame of mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">If you come in even with a big sack of potatoes, it had no monetary value at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">He didn't bother you. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">If you had the biggest loaf of bread on you, he didn't bother you. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">If you had barley or any other, or any other of the vegetables, or cucumbers, or any other of those fruits or vegetables, it had no value. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">He didn't bother you. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">But he was looking for sugar, butter, saccharine and other, and chocolate, and for schnapps -- any other expensive things. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">So I had a contract with Chaimke Lipschitz (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I was buying a big sack of potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I couldn't even move the sack from the, from the, from the spot where I bought it. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Chaimke, it was after the <span class="DLF">line</span> -up to go to work, Chaimke was picking up my sack of potatoes, carried all the five, six miles, carried in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I had my niece waiting with a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> , with a little dolly -- and dropped it in the dolly. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I didn't have much farth-- very far to go with this sack of potatoes because on both sides of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , inside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and after the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , after Jewish walked in there were two <span class="DLF">lines</span> of Jewish stretched out with their hands to beg. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Among them was the famous writer, Joseph Garr (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Within seconds, half of my sack of potatoes was emptied out. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Because it was my human duty to give it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And the rest of it was easy to haul with a little more simply, with a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And there my neighbors got, and my family got. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">I, on the other hand, was carrying a little box of a thousand boxes of saccharine. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And there was five hundred saccharine in each box. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">That product, brought in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , was *° Watchmaster (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="822">converted to millions, probably, in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">You could have gotten twenty-five suits. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">You could have gotten gold and diamonds, all for that little box. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">So I was carried this -- the box was not as long as these, as light as this, but only that thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">So I was carrying under my arm, and dancing like a prima donna with that little box. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Except one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">You do realize that if I were caught with that little box getting in the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , I would have been brutally beaten up and shot right there on the <span class="REGION">premises</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And Chaimke Lipman (ph) would have had no punishment at all for bringing in my sack of potatoes, because they saw his sack of potatoes.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Ok, we're back on. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">We're being taped again. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">We were, we were with when you're coming back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">ANSWER:  One morning, I went out again to be, to be wait, to look for the opportunity to be captured and taken to units outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that I would be able to bring in some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I was captured soon enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">I was taken inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto Kommandantur</span> , where there were a group of <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> -- seven, eight single-story <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And it happened to be isolated away from the residents of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="842">The only next <span class="BUILDING">building</span> closest was the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish police precinct</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="843">I was taken to the Kommandantur. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">A Jewish woman by the name of Luba, who was working there already, took me to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , pointed her finger to a big shovel and a broom and an axe and a saw to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">saw woods</span> , and told me to clean the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Then told me to clean the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846">When I was finished with that, I was sawing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and when I was finished with sawing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , I was chopping the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Luba was the maid for the Commandant. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">The new Commandant was by the name of Ritter. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">He was there every second morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">He arrived every second morning, one o'clock in the afternoon, stayed there for, for the next, one afternoon, one o'clock in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Stayed there until the next and the following afternoon, for two afternoons. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And one o'clock arrived, his former, his friend Tschich, who was on duty as Commandant -- both of them, they're former police officers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And while I worked the first day and cleaned the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> and cleaned out everything - the <span class="DLF">street</span> , the, the, the, the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I realized that thanks to Luba and Esther, the two main maids of the Kommandantur, I will have the opportunity if nothing else will happen to feed my family and several other families. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Because this is the outlet that I have the opportunity to get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">After a while, I trained myself to be so fast with all the other work that I was through by half day; and the rest of the half day, I was polishing the boots and the belt buckles and the belts of the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettowache</span> contained of about seven, eight individual story combined <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> with two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> with one <span class="DLF">entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And all <span class="DLF">entrances</span> was on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">On the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , with a <span class="DLF">window</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> but no <span class="DLF">door</span> to get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">After a short period of time, under Luba's and Esther's influence, the Commandant instructed me to bring in all the confis-- almost all the confiscated food that was taken away from the Jewish in the evening when they came in from the work on the outside brigade, working brigades. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And it was all lined up in my hands to take care of and being in charge of separating, to bring in almost all the food in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> of the Commandant Ritter. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">The <span class="BUILDING">Jewish police precinct</span> was only a short distance away. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">The Chief of Third Jewish Police Precinct was a certain Kamse (ph), or Tarsis (ph) -- I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">A former good friend of mine from the wars, from the days before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I had made arrangements with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">He was sending twenty to twenty-four policemen, lined up behind the <span class="DLF">window</span> of the, of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> of the Commandant. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I was opening the <span class="DLF">window</span> , putting up the <span class="DLF">window</span> or opening it, and hand over the first package to the first policeman who was standing behind the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="868">He turned and gave it to the next, until it land up in the <span class="BUILDING">precinct</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And there, the Commandant was calling in, the Chief of Police called in the victims from whom the merchandise was taken away and returned to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">After a while, Commandant Ritter instructed me to go to the Chief of Police and tell him that the Jewish who are coming in from the outside brigade should sew in initials on their bags, on their shopping bags, which was confiscated. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">So they should be able to get in return their own properties. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">All, all the Gestapo used to come and pick up some food for themselves from, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="873">They were coming in a small black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Volkswagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Luba 1s the one who prepared everything for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Also, the food for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettowache</span> -- primarily, the Commandant -- was cooked with the confiscated food. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">After a while -- but, but after a while, what's going on was while I was returning the food to the Jews, the Lithuanian Ghettowache started to mumble that they don't have enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And where would they have enough food? </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Because some of the food was returned to the victims, and it wasn't enough to cook for them, so they had to bring in foods for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">The Wache was hanging on, the Lithuanian and the German Ghettowache was hanging on the <span class="REGION">premises</span> because the duty around the <span class="DLF">fences</span> was only for two hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">After the two hours, they were free for four hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">They couldn't possibly go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then come back in the four hours, or three hours, or two and two -- I just don't remember exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">It was not enough time for them to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then come back on duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">So they were laying around in the outer <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> recuperating and resting and sewing their stockings, and do any of the other things there necessary while they were waiting to go back on duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">In order to prevent any of the guards -- the Jewish or the German -- or any outside German who would come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to catch what I'm doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Because if it would have been discovered what I'm doing, I would have been the second to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Commandant Ritter would have been the first to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">For the period of the time when I was bringing in the food in his <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> from the, from the <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> opposite, he lined them all up in front on the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , on the <span class="DLF">lawn</span> up front, and personally conducted with all of them physical exer- exercise. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Up and down, and down and up, and up and down, and down and up. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Some of them were getting so exhausted that they couldn't move every time. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And the only time when I walked around with my big broom and shovel twice around the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , that was the signal to him that it's all over, and he released them. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">That was going on for two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">After that Tschich came, and he was for two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Although Tschich, Commandant Tschich, never harmed me at all -- he was rather decent to me -- but he told me from the first day that if he, if he will ever catch me returning anything to the, of the confiscated food to the Jews, he will shot me right there and then. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And I followed his rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">He never caught me returning anything and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">When I was finished with the actual duty of helping in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and peeling potatoes and cleaning the latrines, I was shining the buckles and the boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">You can be assured that the most beautiful polished boots in the whole world was Commandant Ritter's. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And his buckle -- so was his buckle. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I had invented a special invention. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">I took a glass, a empty glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And with the back side of the glass I rubbed in the polish on the boot and the buckle, let it dry out for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And then, when the, with the, with the, with bottom side of the glass I circular rubbed all away. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And I'm not sure that if anybody in the world would have had such a beautiful shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">After a while -- I think it was about four or five months -- and Ritter and Tschich, the whole unit -- the whole unit moved away. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And a new unit came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And the commandant of that new unit was a German by the name of Schultz. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">He did not instruct me to repeat the same things what I did with Commander Ritter, except he instructed me something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">At that time, the Gestapo permitted to form a Volkskiiche~”- a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> to give the starving Jews, those that were starving, to give soup during the day free of charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And that volksktiche needed food to cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And there was a former Hebrew teacher, I think by the name of Schulgasser (ph), who would come, who was coming with a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And he fill down, the horse, I fill down for him the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> with the food, and they took away. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">After a short period of time, I am sure that there was -- again, under the influence of Luba and Esther -- he, he instructed me to go to the Chief of the Third Precinct, <span class="BUILDING">Police Precinct</span> , Mr. Tomason (ph), and tell him he should arrange that Schulgasser should have a second horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> similar to the first horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">If the first horse was a white horse, so the second one should be a white horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And stay a distant away. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And when he was filled up with the first one and the first one came out from the <span class="REGION">territory</span> of the <span class="REGION">Ghettowache territory</span> , to bring in the second one and filling in the second one. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Schultz, at the time when it became already very, very difficult, and at a time when it was known that Obersturmbannfiihrer Goecke”’ is coming to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> -- and Goecke was known by all Jews that he was the liquidator. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">He started from the furthest part in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and when the German armies were stepping back toward <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , he was liquidating <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">At the time it was known that Goecke is coming with units of liquidating the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno

then already in the beginning of '44, 1944, even some of the worst murde-- Lithuanian murderers became already friendly with Jews because they were looking already for a ticket. </span><span

back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="931">By then it was a big <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> with maybe several hundred SS guards, and it required more people to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And quite a few Jews managed to get themselves in the brigade. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And while they were there, they were locked in together with me, and they became permanent laborers, slave laborers, for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettowache</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="934">The, the

about 15 blocks further was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettowache</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And it was the low, lower

away from the <span class="REGION">premises</span> , because nobody wanted to stumble into Goecke. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">The only person who had a strong influence on him in a relationship to the, to the, to the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> was Unter-- Oberscharftthrer Blaufuchs, the head of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , because he was putting

</span><span class="sentence" id="955">As several Jews, from time to time -- arranged by the admin-- Jewish Judenrat™ -- they're coming to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wache</span> to, to beg and to buy themselves food. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Because every outside work brigade had the opportunity to buy food, except the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And a lot of people who worked on the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> get passes to go to the other work brigades, in order to be able to get themselves food; because the airport slave labor was the real slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And the whole existence of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> depended on the <span

id="965">I just don't remember what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And I walked out outside of the <span class="DLF">gates</span> , outside of the premises, in the next <span

I never did, but to do somebody a very important favor, I did walk out. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">The premises of the, of the, of the, of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was that on the front on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> was the <span class="DLF">walking entrance</span> , but on the side <span class="DLF">street</span> was the <span class="DLF">driving entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And the <span class="DLF">gate</span> was constantly open to <span class="DLF">driving entrance</span> , because there was a danger the Goecke may drive 1n any time. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And how would it be that <span class="DLF">gate</span> is closed, and he had to beep, blow the horn to be let in? </span><span class="sentence" id="970">So it was constantly open. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I walked out to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next to, close enough to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettowache</span> , and discussed with the farmer, with the gentile family about the question I was, I came to ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And I, I was about ready to go back, and two Lithuanian policemen arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And one of them sat down to write the protocol to take me to the Gestapo where I would have been immediately shot because they got a bonus for bringing me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And the other was walking around from <span class="DLF">door</span> , from the <span class="DLF">door</span> to the middle of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , while the first one was writing the protocol. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I was standing as shivering like, like, like, like <span class="NPIP">hell</span> for a few seconds, and then it dawned on me, "What am I shivering?" </span><span class="sentence" id="976">I looked around, and I saw that the <span class="DLF">door</span> was a push-out from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">I waited on the next turn when the guard, the policeman, was coming closer to the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And I run to the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">I pushed with my foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I start running. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">They shoot at me, but they didn't got me. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And I was immediately, through the open wide <span class="DLF">gate</span> , in on the <span class="REGION">premises</span> , I immediately came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="983">She immediately informed Oberscharfthrer Blaufuchs and he within seconds took me, put me upstairs, put a guard over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And a few minutes later, the two Lithuanian came to look for me, and he chased them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">His chasing them out was it was only a momentary victory, a moment, a momen-- a momentarily victory. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">The higher powers over him were of the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And those two Lithuanian policeman were, were the employees of the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">It was their business to capture the Jewish on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> so they could have reported to the Gestapo and get, and Gestapo could have come and find me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And Obersturmbann-- Ober, Oberscharfthrer Blaufuchs could not have helped a bit in that case. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">But within seconds, he lined up a closed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , got two guards shipped out with me <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , took me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="991">And in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , where will they find me?

class="sentence" id="1002">It was going on by the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">It took probably about five, six months from the time Goecke arrived until he started to liquidate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">All that depended on the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">If the front got closer, then he liquidated faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">In the meantime, he started to organize the Konzentrationslager Kovno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">In the meantime, he had the Kinder”’ and the woman and the old people liquidation, where all the children and all the old people were in one day lined up and taken to be destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">In that action, my little seven years old nephew and my almost 75 years old mother was taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">They told me afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">It's a German Wachmeister, one of the units. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">When he came back, cried when he told me in torturous murder, how they destroyed the people, the old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Mothers, mothers, mothers, mothers were, were, were, were falling, kneeling for them, kissing their feet, not to take their child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">So they killed the mother with the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">They were taking children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">The main action of liquidating, it was in the front of the three big <span class="BUILDING">brick buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">They were taking children, the, the, the Ukrainian and Lithuanian murderers were going up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">It was a three story <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">They were finding

<span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">And he picked them up and knocked his head on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , choking up, until the child was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">The German Wachmeister who told me the brutality told me how a woman was find, a elderly woman was find in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">The <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> were wooden <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , wooden bungalows-like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And she was hiding, and it was almost all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And she mistakenly stuck out her head to see if it 1s all over and the Gestapo man saw her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">They were walking with big sticks exactly for that purpose, with wide, with wide handles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">My stick doesn't have a wide handle, but their stick had special wide curves in order to grab a, a person's neck and pull them like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">So the Wachmeister cried for me, in telling me how brutally elderly woman was dragged with the stick on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> until she was dead before she was thrown in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">When I came back after, when they started to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and brought me back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , my sister told me that that old lady was my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">That's the way she was, she was taken out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">At the start of the liquidation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> , the last few days Goecke, personally, and, and, and Berman (ph) or Breller (ph), his assistant -- I don't really remember him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">In the book their whole names, but it's not important for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">They, personally, they're driving around the <span class="REGION">areas</span> where groups of young people they're trying to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">Everybody knew it's the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And they caught them and shot them on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , on the <span class="DLF">field</span> -- wherever they caught them -- without any mercy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">Immediately, they murdered them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">I was brought in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> , back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">KZ

class="sentence" id="1037">They needed to prepare straw, straw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">And I was called in with the other former workers °° Children (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">to prepare the sacks for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">In those days they were building -- there was a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> where the wood was located, and all the tools. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">It was old rotten wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">They were building new <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> up to the last minute to prevent the Jewish to go through the, to cut through, dig out and, and -- because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> was all then rotten, to, to break it out and go, and go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">So I, I, I, I, with the five, six other Jewish workers there, practically the last couple days before the liquidation of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> attempted to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">We attempted to dig out in the <span class="NPIP">side</span> that was still rotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">You pull it out from under the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">You dug out the <span

<span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and he had prepared his <span class="NPIP">place</span> for himself <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">And when he noticed that, he came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and informed on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">So you should see this scene, how the cook, and the assistant cook, and Wagner and, and, and, and Blaufuchs all came out to help us dig back in, so those who would see and kill us immediately they should not be able to see anything that were not smooth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">It was not smooth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">There was a guard, Schmittus (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">One of the guards was a man by the name

id="1055">You know what a Volksdeutsche, Volksdeutsche is? </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And the Nazis recognized Volksdeutsche as Deutsche’. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Some of the Volksdeutsche were the worst murderers, and some of them were decent people- like all people are bad and good, except the good were in a very small minority. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">Probably amongst 10 thousands, you could have find one or two decent people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">Schmittus tried, made so many efforts to help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">Schmittus was constantly arguing with Blaufuchs against the treatment of, the bad treatment of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">But he was arguing with the wrong person, because Blaufuchs didn't have any better, any other opinion than he had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">The day before we were liqui-- before we were taken back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> , and few days before the total liquidation, I was doing my work and Wagner called me over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">His <span

you know, but a very decent person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">We taught him that when you see danger -- Goecke, or Gestapo, or any other officer- he should knock on the <span

id="1097">Das ist nicht mein Schuld -- mein Schuld, dass ich keine Star of David habe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">Der Wagner verlangte ich soll sein Fahrrad saubermachen, (and) um nicht zu verschmutzen die Jacke mit die gelbe Stern ... hab ich runtergenommen und ich ging mit dem Fahrrad zu der Bahn um meine Gezeig zu nehmen."”” </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">In that moment, he lowered down the revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">And within, in, in that moment, Blaufuchs was already near him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">That's the only person whom he'll listen to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">Wagner was on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and other high ranking SS officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">There was a new man who came a few days ago -- a huge person, a SS officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">He probably was the head of the transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">And he saw what's going on, and everybody testified on my behalf, that I was not attempting to escape with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">I was just going to the other <span class="NPIP">area</span> to clean it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">It, it took minutes, and Goecke gave a shout to me, "Verschwinden!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">And I immediately "verschwind.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">You know what “verschwind”’ 1s -- disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">And I disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">He went to have lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">He walked out from his lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">Blaufuchs was right behind him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">And he shouted, "Wo ist die Jude mit die blaue Jacke?!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And I immediately was there standing, like, like, like "Attention!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And he delivered this small speech to me, and he explained that the "Blaue Jacke ist beschlagnahmt."”” </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">It's confiscated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">And again shouted to me, "Andreten! </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">> AndI walked away, and he drove away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">And the same day, we were taken back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and it started the liquidation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">meant “bigshot” and was used by ghetto inhabitants to announce warnings; for example, an approaching German guard. * "</span><span class="sentence" id="1122">Lieutenant Colonel Goecke, it is not my fault, my fault that I have no Star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">Mr. Wagner demanded that I clean his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and so as not to stain the jacket with the yellow star ... I have taken it off and I went to the rail with my stuff.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="1124">German) *! “</span><span class="sentence" id="1125">Where is the Jew with the blue jacket?” (</span><span class="sentence" id="1126">German) * “Blue jacket is confiscated.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="1127">German) * Attention (German) I arrived Saturday night back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , never to go back to the, to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettowache</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">I slept over the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">I, I had my niece then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">My mother and the baby, Alenke was already murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">By the way, people told me when I arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that that was the day when Goecke murdered, caught and murdered four or five group of young people -- a total of six, seven people per group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">About thirty, forty people were murdered that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">And that's when they permitted me to be saved from Goecke, in a situation like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">Couldn't happen in a million years anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And Sunday morning the Wache started already to catch us and to put us in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Shortly before I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> , two or three weeks before, to to and never came to come back to work for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettowache</span> , I noticed that Jewish were <span class="BUILDING">building</span> near the Kaisergasse (ph), a <span class="DLF">gate</span> — a, a, a <span class="DLF">fence</span> , a fenced a, a, a <span class="DLF">wire fence</span> , a wire bu-- a wire partition like -- four or five times as big as this here, on the <span class="DLF">field</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">And somehow I thought maybe, maybe, maybe that will be to, to drive in Jews before the liquidation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">Anyhow, Sunday morning the liquidation started, and I was caught by one of the new guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And -- no, I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">I was -- I begged my sister to go with me whatever will be happened, and my niece to go with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">But she got permission to go in a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> which one of the most prominent Jewish people build. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">She was a friend of the man's wife, and they permitted her to stay until. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">And we figured it's only for three or four days, and 1n three or four days Russians were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And they permitted my niece, after a while, to going in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And while I was running to look for directions they had -- Mongrel (ph) was his name -- came out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and invited me, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">I am a, Iam a breathing difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">I was then, and I am today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">So after being there for a couple of seconds, the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> was built for maybe 12, 14 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">By when I came in -- the last one, I and my niece there was already- | was already the 67th or the 68th. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">It was burning hot in July. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">It was the first week in July, so how long could I have stayed in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">After a few seconds, I started to cough and I got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">I forced Dinah, my niece, also to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">Somehow, she listened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And we were captured right away on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and put in the enclosed <span class="DLF">wire fence</span> that was fenced. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">We were one of the few in the beginning, but as the day progressed, it became thousands of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">People were stepping on each other already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">We were laying there for three days and three nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">On the second day, the transportation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno ghetto</span> took place in three groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">The first group went out Sunday afternoon without any incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">They went out, and they were taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">The second group was my transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">But the Jewish that they find on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , they lined them up and safely under the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">But they were going with Jewish men, Jewish policemen, from <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , fish out the people in the <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And there, the woman were laying nude just in a <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and the men were practically nude, and brought them all to the to the encampment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">So from an <span class="REGION">area</span> that it could house maximum a hundred or 200 people, there were already two-- 3000 people concentrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And it became a tremendous situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">You had to do your bowel movements right there and then on the <span class="REGION">premises</span> because you couldn't go anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And the stink from the smell from the <span class="INT_SPACE">bowels</span> was not to be believed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">I think we were laying there for three, four days or more, because they couldn't get transportation for us to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , to go to the, to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Anyhow, in those days, Schmittus was crawling from body -- person to person over the people to look for "the David." </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">Iam "the David." </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">I am David. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">And when he find, “Who would know is ‘the David’? </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">Only the few Jews who worked with me knew that they called “the David.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">There must have been fifty Davids there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">Who would know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">He finally find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">And when he find me, he told me that I, when, to-- tonight or the next night, they wake us all up to march out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">And at that time, I should try to be the very last <span class="DLF">line</span> , and I instructed my niece to be the very one with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">And other people who were near me, I instructed them the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">He said, by being the very last <span class="DLF">line</span> , he and Wagner and two other additional people will close up the <span class="DLF">line</span> of guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">They will be the last guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And as soon as they get out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I should escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">He said naturally I should not get concerned that all four of them will, will kneel and shoot at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">But they wouldn't shoot at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">I should keep running. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">I instructed my sister, my niece to do that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">I was ready to two eventualities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">I wanted to escape anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I was ready, I hoped for two things may happen while I'm escaping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">Maybe I'll escape and be an escapee; or while escaping I'll be shot in the rear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">Without pain, I'll be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">I happened to walk out Sunday morning in a clean, bright shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">And while laying the few days 1n the <span class="DLF">field</span> , I find the brother of my brother-in-law, who happened to have had a brown shirt, a dark shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">And I exchanged with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I gave him my shirt, and he gave me his shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">I, I, I had a silly logic that if I'll have to run in the middle of the night, the guards may see my white shirt and shoot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">The brown shirt, they will not see, because I planned to run out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">I had a German bag, a bread bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">It's a linen bread bad by a hanging strap where they were carrying their loaf of bread, and I had a razor there and a couple of small things, and that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">I was ready to escape, to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">That's all I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">I felt I'll never wind up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">And I instructed my niece to do that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">When they marched out, about four o'clock in the, early in the morning, I tried to be the last <span class="DLF">line</span> , and I was about in the last <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">I was about the closest to the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> to be able to run in a, in a, in a private <span class="DLF">house garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">It was through a little <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">I planned to do that, but I realized that Schmittus was not in the back and he's not the one to decide in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he would stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">And all he did is tried to sell me a bill of goods I should try to save myself and believe him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And with that, I may, I may survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And that's all that he wanted: to help me to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">As soon as we walked out, Christa Kartigas (ph) took us -- I think 1t was Christa Kartigas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">We walked out maybe twenty steps from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">I saw an open <span class="DLF">gate</span> , that little pri-- that little <span class="DLF">gateway</span> to a private <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">You, you know what I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">I ran in, and I ran through the <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And a Lithuanian was working in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , and he followed me and he caught me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">And I loosened myself, and he remained with the same jacket that was supposed to be “beschlagnahmt” and the sleeves of the shirt, in his hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">And I was already away from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">And I kept running and running and running, until I came to a big <span class="DLF">fence</span> that was — the, the Lithuanian government had had built up a huge animal, animal in -- animal, animal treatment for -- how do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">A, a—to, to, to cure animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">Oh, my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">I forgot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">I forgot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1226">QUESTION:  Oh, like an <span class="BUILDING">animal treatment center</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1227">ANSWER:  Ok, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">And it was a huge tall <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">And I couldn't, I couldn't possibly climb over the -- in my height. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">It just happened that a pile of garbage was laying right there where I find myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">I climbed up on the garbage, climbed over the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And halfway on my -- halfway to the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , I see there are hundreds of German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">So I ran back, climbed over -- from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , it was easier to climb because there are the two planks, the bottom plank and the top plank. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">It was easy for me to climb back in, and I continued walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">I walked all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">And a tremendous rain storm broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">And I hid in the corn to hide myself from the rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">How much I can hide myself from the rain, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">But I, I was, I was like a animal, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">My mind was like a animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">And the four guards, when I escaped with -- and, and, and when I walked out from the corn, my body was all smeared up in clay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And I, I slept the night over in a, in a, in a, in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">And the next morning, I continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">By then I was hungry and thirsty, and I was making up my mind which <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I should attempt to go in and ask for something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">And I noticed a big looking <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and I thought maybe, maybe, maybe a owner of property -- they call it pomeshchik,” in that time -- and most of them were Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">They, they're land owners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">The rich land owners were Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">And the Poles were not so hot with the Lithuanians, and he may have been willing to help me, give me some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">So I started to go to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because I thought it's the owner of a rich man, because it's a bigger <span class="BUILDING">house</span> than the average. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">When I came close enough, I noticed it's the Ninth Fortification. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">And I went back, and I started again walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">About noontime, I fall asleep -- weak and hungry, and smeared out in clay like, like , like a stray cat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">And while I fall asleep, I heard voices of children -- Lithuanian voices saying, "Zydu’’! </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">Zydu! </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">Ectu (ph) Gestapo!" -- "</span><span class="sentence" id="1256">Run to Gestapo!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">So I got up, and I went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">I, I, I, I just didn't had enough strength to continue from hunger and thirst. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">So I walked in, in a <span class="DLF">yard</span> of another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">I took the next best <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which to walk in, and I walked tn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">It just so happened that the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was up front, and the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> was all the way in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">So it took me a distant to go to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">And halfway to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , the whole <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> was full with German soldiers retreating from the army down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">And the proprietor was a old Russian farmer, a gentile, Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">And he saw me, measured up the situation right there and then, came over towards me and embraced me like he was, he caught a new relative who just came to visit him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Pushed me out from the <span class="REGION">area</span> , walked in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , gave me a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">And I continued walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">I walked for quite a distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">Then I came to a <span class="DLF">highway</span> where a lot of Lithuanians were escaping from the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">The war was coming nearer, closer and closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">And I lined up and I and I lined myself up with the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> of a Lithuanian with a family, and he gave me something to eat and let me walk with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">But he told me if the Germans should come and look for, he will tell me -- he will tell them -- that Iam a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">So after I relaxed and thought on this moment for a few minutes, I continued to walk by myself on the <span class="DLF">upper hill</span> of * Landowner (Russian) © Jew (Lithuanian) the, of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> -like <span class="DLF">highway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">It was no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">It was little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">And towards late at night, again it started to rain, and I was terribly wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">I walked in, in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">It was a man and two women -- brother and two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">They gave me milk and bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">I, I ate fancy foods all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">Nothing tasted as good as that bread and milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">They took me to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">They dug out a, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> full of hay which they had prepared from the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">They put me in the, in the hay, and they covered it back up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">I slept half a night, and early in the morning I continued to walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">I walked all day, practical all day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">Again hungry, without any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">And suddenly I'm facing three <span class="DLF">roads</span> : one, two, three. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">And what do I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">Where do you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">So I pick a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">You know when you were a child, a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> -- "You love me, you don't love me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">And I pulled the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> , and I designated this one is this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> , this one is this one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">And it fall on the one I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">I went originally to the straight one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">And I continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">Late in the evening, I came to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the woman took me in and told me that her husband is hiding Jews in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and I should. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">After she gave me to eat, she, she sent me upstairs 1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">And this early in the morning, he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he woke me up, and we started to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">He was looking for signals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">He was removing <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and looking for signals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">And we find after a while he did find a signal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">And the most amazing thing, in the midst of the darkest area, well, now you couldn't see any further, any further, he, he bend down two <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , two branches. </span><span
