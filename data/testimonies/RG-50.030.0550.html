then we — we traveled from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">In the middle of the night the — they brought big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military truck</span> came up — came in, pulled me out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , put hand on my mouth and said, don’t talk, be quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And they took me and put me in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and they told me we going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">But meanwhile, I don’t — I don’t remember if they took other kids or not with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">It — I’m not really remember very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">But they took me and they — we went to different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , I do not know where, what. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">From one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , again traveled through November 8, 2008 Europe again, illegally, just like I did with my mother when my mother escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and went and traveled, and somehow went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , I think to her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">That’s why she returned back, because she couldn’t — nobody help her there and she couldn’t do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So she had to return back. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But she — I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> before, and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , and somehow we return back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I mean, that’s when my mother was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">This time I was moving from one <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And the paper, according to the paper, they put me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> Sylvania(ph), and they — we — to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">In the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , I had a friend, the name Natala(ph), and she is in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And she was in my <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> too, because I visited <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 2004, and we see that we [indecipherable] together, Natala(ph) and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , I do not know — the British caught us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> when we were close to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> — everybody was so happy — the British caught us and arrested us and put us 1n a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So, I think I was about six year old at that time, I became a prisoner of <span class="COUNTRY">United Kingdom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And I don’t know how long we were, but in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I was freezing, was not much — I remember they put <span class="DLF">fences</span> there, and we were sleeping in a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> because there was not enough <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , and — and it was very cold and freezing, and not enough food over there to — and, by the way, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to — to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was not enough food to eat also, and every day we ate only fish. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And I hated fish so much November 8, 2008 because all — every meal was only fish, too, there was no other food to eat, any more left. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And that was very tough, and that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was also — people were, I think, Turkish, Arabs, Turkish were on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And they wear the red hat that Turkish wear, and I think they were Turkish, and I used to be afraid of them so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And somebody was saying on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that they stealing the kids, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So I always frightened from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Anyway, on the way back in — back to — I mean <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , and then <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was declared as a state, I was taken out of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and later on they send me to a foster family in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And the name of the family, Goldschmidt [indecipherable] DDR [indecipherable] near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Netanya</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And I had foster family, and that was — life was not easy beginning because I had — I had to get used to new — to a family life, which I never had family before. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I had never had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And they were very tough, they were Germans from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And — Jewish Germans, and they were very, very tough disciplinary people, and they discipline me with the — a lot of hitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I got again a lot of hitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I did, again, pee-pee in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And they hit me for that also. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And so the wa — life wasn’t easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But then first grade I didn’t do good because in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , first grade, I used all the time to dream about the fox who eated the kids, except me not. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So I couldn’t concentrate in the class, and I was — I didn’t do good in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So they decided I’m going to be left over, and take the class first grade again. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So the November 8, 2008 foster family said no, she cannot. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I’m going to sit with her during the summer, and don’t leave her, because she has friends there now, and she used to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And this will be a crime for her to — to move to new fr — kids, and again the same class. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So my foster mother sat with me every day, teach me math and teach me to read and write, and believe me on that, by the end of the summer I took a test for the

have family members. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Now became another problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">My uncle in — Isaac Makowski(ph), who lives in — who at that time lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , he was not happy with the family that I was living, because they were not religious Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They were nice people, Jewish, but they were not Orthodox like he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">He was

class="sentence" id="227">And I refused to come to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at the time because I hated him for doing what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">So that came another family, and they told me that my uncle died, and they wanted to bring me to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , to give me a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I do not know who they November 8, 2008 were. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And that family had twins. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Babies, two ba — twins,

didn’t work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">But then [indecipherable] so it didn’t work out that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And then I moved to <span
