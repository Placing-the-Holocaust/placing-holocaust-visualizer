<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Can you tell me your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Johanna Newman, which is a rather difficult name to put on for this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that's what it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born uh on December 2nd, 1930, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And did your parents ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I'm an only child and uh an only grandchild for the first five years of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My cousin Stephen was born in 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I was very close to my maternal grandparents who lived very near us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Spent many very happy childhood hours in their uh company. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Had a wonderful relationship with my grandfather, who passed away in December 1935, and that was a great uh calamity to my young years. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I became perhaps even closer to my grandmother at that time, and that grandmother played a very important role uh in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">She still managed to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">She was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and when we arrived in 1946 we resumed that close relationship until her dying days uh in the early '60's. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Uh on my father's side uh my grandfather lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Unfortunately the grandmother, after whom I am named, Johanna, passed away when my father came out of the 1st World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">She died in February 1919 from the then-epidemic of the so-called Spanish Influenza and I obviously never knew her. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I did know the second partner of my grandfather was a very lovely lady by the name of , well-known but the sister of the wellknown uh . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Uh I did visit these grandparents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I'm not quite sure how often and they came to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> but uh that grandfather also died very early, in March of 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So I don't have too much of a recollection except that I do remember him. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">a very stern man, very religious man, very learned man as a matter of fact in both the working and religious category.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Well, mine was really very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Uh I have a very recollections of being a little bit spoiled, being that I'm the only grandchild or was the only grandchild until uh I was five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Uh I was taken to many <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My parents took me to uh <span class="DLF">parks</span> , <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> , etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We lived in a very lovely <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I had wonderful toys, and with the uh birth of my cousin who of course almost became like a brother figure to me since I was an only child, uh life was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I spent an awful lot of time, many hours with my aunt and unale, and as a matter of fact, the relationship uh with that aunt and uncle and my other aunt, and I will mention their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Uh the parents of my cousin are Lotta (ph) and Eric , and unfortunately my uncle Eric just passed away uh about two and uh since both my parents died within ten weeks of each other in 1961, I can honestly say that my two aunts and my uncle very much took the place of my parents not only to me but also to my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">have the same emotional attachment to these two aunts and one uncle as I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Uh I spent many happy hours with my aunt and uncle after my cousin was born, and uh when they decided that it was time to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which was in March of 1937, they uh so-called brother figure and now had disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">They had left, and we were left alone uh with my grandmother She was not married and she left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the Kristallnacht, in December of 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">She lived with my grandmother and again with her too I had a very wonderful relationship and still do. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Uh I would think that uh the loss of my aunt and uncle and my cousin was overcome in same measure that now <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And I entered <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the school year of 1937, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> uh called at one time <span class="BUILDING">School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Rather famous for it's <span class="BUILDING">girls school</span> of uh high but by the time I went to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> it was no longer called . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I believe it was closed in 1933 and the , but uh the buildilng was taken over by the Jewish community uh <span class="BUILDING">center</span> , community council or whatever it was called in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> when Jewish children no longer could attend <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And I went to this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was one, at that point, perhaps on the scale of an American so-called <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew day school</span> , a half-day uh singular subject and half-days. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Unfortunately I only went to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for about a year and a half before we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but the year and a half I was there were very happy years. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I remember my some of the girls that went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and in particular the daughters of my parentsâ€™ friend, friends, the Meyers, Dr. Meyer and his wife Edith and their three daughters, uh no, three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Two daughters and one son. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">One of the daughters, . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">The Meyers immigrated with us to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and the Millers went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and , but when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> after the war in 1946, this was my first contact was Eve Miller and I think that I could say that really the clouds over my childhood did not begin until well, the death of my two grandfathers, which obviously had some effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Uh 1n particular because they didn't want to tell me that my grandfather had passed away, which obviously Uh! </span><span class="sentence" id="47">spent a lot of time consoling my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Uh I do remember but nevertheless it seems that my presence uh being with her did help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Uh as, and obviously then my father had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and again there was a the memorial candles that were burning in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I do remember that very vividly, and really both parents were in doing the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And strangely enough both are my parents dying within ten weeks of each other and I was in for more than. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Uh and as I say, I think that the first clouds that I can recollect obviously began when in October of 1938, one day the teacher came into our <span class="INT_SPACE">classroom</span> and said all those children whose parents had immigrated into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> uh please leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Your parents would like you to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , or whatever she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">She certainly didn't say that they were going to be deported that very same day but this was the beginning of the deportation of uh Polish Jews in particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I, perhaps it was other Jews as well, I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But I think 1t was Polish Jews primarily were sent that very day, that same evening, out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and back to the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I think that the Poles didn't want them, and the Germans didn't want them. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I do remember that there was a child of a SpanishPortugese family in my class, and he was the rabbi of the uh I think, I believe the one and only <span class="BUILDING">Spanish synagogue</span> in uh all of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and she was in my <span class="INT_SPACE">classroom</span> , and I think that she also was called out. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I'm not, I couldn't uh vouch for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But children of Polish parents were deported, together with their families that very uh evening, and that was October 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Obviously that left some impression on all of us children. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I don't know to what extent thet meant anything to us, but I'm sure it also created a great deal of uncertainity and insecurity of our parents as that did in itself must have been felt by the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Then the next big event obviously was the 10th of November, 1938 - the Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And I have very vivid and very clear recollections of that event. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Like every other morning I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and uh this is not the uh era of radio and television and we didn't know what happened during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I was sent to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> like every other morning, and my way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> passed a big uh <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> , the center of ,Jewish life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And in fact the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> has done a great deal to uh bring the whole life of what they call the Jewish life under the which is that section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> where the orthodox Jews lived, where the big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Uh they bought all this back to life with many, in many different ways, particularly the permanent exhibits. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I think the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> stood today has a memorial plaque which was only last year uh inaugurated and we brought the exhibit to in July which was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But nevertheless, this is the place I had to cross on my way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and what I saw was hoards of people standing in front of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and throwing stones <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And uh as we arrived, of course we ran past the uh the <span class="NPIP">place</span> itself, the noise, the shouting, the screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I suppose there was an aura of because we still didn't know what was happening but I suppose just the mere fact that so many people were there and throwing stones into the stained glass windows was enough to make us and arrived at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and were immediately told that our parents would pick us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">We should remain calm and we wouldn't have <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And indeed a few minutes later, or a half hour later or whatever the case may be, my mother did arrive and took me to my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> where my father already was. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And here then unfolded slowly but surely the uh grim story of what happened during the night, that the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> all through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had been set on fire, destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">were burned in most cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">It is known that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> sacrificed themselves to run into the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> to save some of the , hid them and I believe were successful in doing so. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Uh that the had been demolished. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">merchandise had been thrown into the <span class="DLF">streets</span> covered with water and with ink and I mean it was chaos and total destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Uh my father decided that he had to see for himself what was happening and indeed did go into the downtown area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">He came back . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">In the meantime uh many uh men who had arrived for their usual place of work were already being imprisoned or taken off to uh <span class="BUILDING">police stations</span> and eventually ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> or in or many other <span class="NPIP">places</span> that at that time already existed as uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I'm not sure whether <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> was already in existence but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and were. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And my aunt at that time was engaged to be married to a man by the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">and he had arrived at work and was immediately taken by the police to . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We stayed the entire day with my grandmother, so the events that were taking place and this was as I said the center Jewish life, so obviously knew where the Jews lived my grandmother had a uh <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that looked out on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> , the and from the <span class="DLF">window</span> we could watch much of what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Uh since my grandfather had passed away in 1935 and it was known that there was no man living in her, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and she had a very large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which ran from one side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> to the next, uh my father, another elderly gentlemen and a friend of their family decided to spend the day uh in the <span class="INT_SPACE">back rooms</span> of this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and indeed that day nothing really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">No SS men or no uh secret police came to uh my grandmother's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">We didn't know of course that this was a pogram (ph) that would last for an entire week. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We thought that this would be over in twenty-four hours or that day or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And at night we did go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> uh much against everybody's advice, but my father insisted that uh he was going to sleep in his own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he was not going to be intimidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And we did go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that evening and uh slept in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I don't believe that too much happened during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They may have knocked on our <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">We didn't answer uh the <span class="DLF">door</span> , but the next morning we took a few possessions and decided to go and stay with my grandmother for the duration of the pogrom again known to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Uh I believe that either that day or the next day my father and the friend of the, their's uh Dr. , uh decided to go out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I'm not sure how they made their way, to <span class="BUILDING">summer resort</span> called . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">It's outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">It was the for being prepared for uh <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time, and also a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">In fact I spent one summer there as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And uh this uh was surrounded by a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and I believe that however many Jews took refugee in spent the days in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Maybe the nights too. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">for some reason I guess the SS never got down there, and did not imprison anyone that was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">My father stayed there for the duration of the pogram, What they did is they manufactured uh leather gloves for work people. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">All kinds of gloves for different professions. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And my father had designed a specific glove which was patented and I have the patent at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which perhaps would, will become an artifact if the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> is interested in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Uh he had designed a glove with a certain reinforcement which made these gloves more uh economical to use or longer lasting let's say, uh with certain reinforcements on the palm, and these were gloves for all kinds of industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And in fact if anything his you know mere talking in the era of course after the big depression un in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , across the world I should say, uh and he had really with this business that he had built up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , worked his way up tremendously during the last few years, and ironically as it may sound because of the war industry that was taking place already at that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , his orders and his business dropped quite considerably and uh until the Kristallnacht and when business sort of became impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Uh Jews were no longer allowed to . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Un one other event that did take place and which unfortunakely in my book I made a mistake in the date, saying that it took place in August of 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">It has been corrected, but nevertheless went down as '39, but obviously it took place in August of 1938, and that a decree by the government that all Jews, male and female, had to adopt a Jewish name. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And you had to add your middle name to your name, the middle name. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">All women became Sarah and all men became <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So that now my name became Johanna Yuta (ph) Sarah Gerechter and my mother was Alice Sarah Gerechter and my father was Siegbert Israel Gerechter. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And it's interesting that I realized that even people like my own son and daughter-in-law never heard of this uh law that one can be forced to add a name to their existing name. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And how come that people didn't become suspicious enough to just throw everything away but uh they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Uh my father had maintained that he had been a uh high officer during World War I. He had the Iron Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">He had received in 1935 a cross which was given only to all front line fighters, meaning people who for four years of the Ist World War spent it on the <span class="DLF">front line</span> , and how could the same men now deny him an existence or a livelihood and would throw him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I mean that was something . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I believe that it was part of the psychology played by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Psychology played a very very uh important and powerful role I think can tell from the fact that people would be deported and yet panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">To be told that they were going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> or we were being resettled in the east and didn't know where they really were going to. . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Uh it now became obviously many of the other uh daily uh amenities of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I'm a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I'm panic- stricken or very fearful. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">The thing I expressed in my book, a feeling of constant fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Uh I remember events such as uh, what do you call it, uh air raid alarms . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Of course we Jews were not allowed to go to an air raid uh <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> , even at that stage of the game. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But you had to uh comply with and you were being tested whether that was well enough done so not a not a ray of light would come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And we had to stay in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">The sirens would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">The uh uh fire department would do whatever they were instructed to do, and I remember a tremendous fear, feeling of fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I mean I can feel that fear even today. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I think I can feel the fear that I experienced the night that we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to uh back to our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> Kristallnach the feeling that my father would be taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I think that I had enough understanding to realize what that would mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And the tremendous fear . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Uh this used to I guess that goes way back to 1935, '36 when the big rallies or uh big taking place speak to his supporters, to his uh the masses of and these would be broadcast on the <span class="BUILDING">radio stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And people would put on their radios, and I remember but this must have been summer time. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Windows were open and I was supposed to go to sleep, and I could hear this voice and it is something that I recall vividly and that feeling of fear surfaced all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I could feel it like I felt it as a child . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So the feelings uh the fear was there, and I don't think that I really, I don't think that anybody every really can completely forget that kind of fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Well the world became very insecure as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Uh many friends began to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Every day or every week there were less and less of my friends at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and my parents and their friends, the family uh Meyer, Dr. Meyer and his wife and three children, and my parents trying to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Now the obvious was of course to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">My two aunts by now were in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">They had began to send us affadivits and all the supporting affidavits and uh supporting letters and security and whatever else the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> demanded, and we were registered, but because of the uh trust that my father had, and this here, I think I have to pause for a moment to describe this and it's something that I never understood for a very long, and perhaps even felt, had a feeling of ... ... and that feeling of fear surfaced all over again and I could feel it like I felt it as a child of six and seven and eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So the fear existed and the fear was there, and I don't think that I really, and I don't think that anybody ever really can completely forget that kind of a fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Well, the world became very insecure. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">As I said uh many friends began to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Every day or every week there were less and less of my friends at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and my parents and their friends, the family uh Meyer, Dr. Meyer and his wife and the three children, and my parents, were trying to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Now the obvious was of course to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">My two aunts by now were in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They had began to send us affidavits and all the supporting affidavits and and supporting letters and securities and whatever else the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> demanded, and we were registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But because of the uh trust that my father had, and this and this here I think I have to pause for a moment to describe this and it's something that I never understood for a very long time, and perhaps even felt, fear, had a feeling of of un grudge against my parents for this feeling of security that they expre...that they had for living in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I didn't understand it until recent years when I have read many stories of other people like myself who came from German families and where the feeling was exactly the same, where the attitude was the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They were Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">They had lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Uh I know that my mother's family, I myself in my book have traced back the family for a little bit over two hundred years, and I haven't done a very thorough job, so I'm sure that I can go back much further. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Uh my father's family even though he was born in which was the heart of <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> , uh under American law after the after the uh 1st World War it had been ceased (ph) to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and according to American law it was Polish and therefore he went on the Polish quota, which caused all the problems that it caused that we couldn't get to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But nevertheless, he in his own heart was a German and had always been a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And uh I have to say that today perhaps I can understand it much better that they had such trust that this could never happen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Uh I don't know how, I don't really know how much would an American Jew who has been here for several generations, if the same situation would confront him, though he has the experience of only fifty years ago in the 1n the back of his mind, but how much would he feel that something so drastic, so total and so inhuman could take place. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">But nevertheless this was the feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So that my parents did not register very early for the American quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">My mother and I both having been born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had not, no great problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The quota, our quota came up very quickly, and we could have left for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> several times before leaving for <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I think we were called to the <span class="BUILDING">Consule</span> at least twice if not three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">However, my father according to American law, went on the Polish quota, and that was a small quota and this was, and he had a high number because many eastern European Jews had registered much much earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And of course we weren't going to leave without him, so needless to say each time we gave up our quota and someone else possibly left in our stead. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I believe did. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So that here in the, and the uh Meyer family had not registered early so they really could not leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">They had to also find another <span class="BUILDING">asylum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And it was exactly that. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">It was a search for an <span class="BUILDING">asylum</span> no matter where. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And uh the passibilities were very very slim. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">They thought of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Well <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> required quite a substantial amount of money as the security deposit for every one that uh entered <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I'm not sure what the amount was and I don't think that my parents could have afforded that, and neither apparently could the uh Meyer family, so that we had to find other ways out. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Uh my father I believe had uh - no, not I believe, I know - had cousins in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Was very difficult to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">You had to prove that you were some how or other uh connected professionally to agriculture, and of course that he couldn't prove. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">He was a business man, through and through. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So that was out. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So somehow, and I'm not quite a hundred percent sure how this <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> uh possibility surfaced, but what I had heard always was my mother had met the Albanian attache to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at a bridge party, and uh during the conversation it turned out that he was about to be married and wanted to go on a honey...his honeymoon to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And uh my parents and the Meyer family lent him some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">He got us in return, perhaps not 1n return - I don't want to make it sound that this was a bribery. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I think that he really and honestly was able to officially give them visas to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And uh Dr. Meyer and my mother flew to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> for the day, and they obtained the uh Albanian visas and our passports or a letter - I'm not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">At any rate uh - I'm hesitating on this flight business because my grandmother was not allowed to know at that point that my mother was going to take an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> back to her would have been absolute uh disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I mean how does anybody go into an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But nevertheless when she came safely back the same evening she was told and she sighed relief that she didn't know before. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">At any rate we did get visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Uh and uh now the process of leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> mysteriously began. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">My recollections on that are very very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Number one I had to leave Grandmother because we could not think of taking, well in today's world perhaps her age was not all that advanced - she was in her mid60's. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Today I'm pretty close to that and I consider myself not an old person, but in those days I think one could not think of taking her to a primative country like <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and this is all we knew about <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Uh she was left alone in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> with an older sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Uh her, the chances that she she alone would still make it to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> were fairly good, although she too by coincidence was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Posen</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I believe that my grandfather from my father's family and her family knew each other in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Posen</span> of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Uh but uh at any rate she was on the Polish quota as well and we took a chance to just leave her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">That was very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Uh my my parents uh now proceeded to unravel all their affairs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We had to give up our things. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">We had to give our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Uh and we thought that we would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , transfer our documents with the American Consule to the <span class="BUILDING">American Consule</span> in , which indeed we did and that we would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> for a period of maybe four months, five months, half a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Uh I'm not even sure that they thought it would take that long. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Considering and uh thinking back of the amount of luggage that we took with us, and the kind of clothes we took with us, 1t was really considered only a matter of months that we would be in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Uh the rest of our belongings, that which we were allowed to take out, because here we are, January, February, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">We're not allowed to take out any silver. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We're not allowed to take out mare than 10 marks per person. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Uh we're not allowed to take out any jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We're not allowed to take out many other things, nothing that was newly purchased. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I mean there were very very specific uh rules and regulations. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I believe that in my papers at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> I even have lists of things my parents took with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I have I think a document that states uh that you're only allowed to take out things that were purchased one year prior to your uh immigration and things of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I mean everything was made very clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">They packed a lift (ph) under the supervision of German uh officials. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Everything was checked, what went in there, and uh these lifts were left in the storage of the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> with the intention that as soon as we would arrive in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> we would send for these lifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I believe that at the time the rule was that you could not just simply send off your lift to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and it makes sense, because I think the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , or the harbor of New York would have been flooded with lifts of people who unfortunately never made it themselves there. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So our lift was left in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , in the uh harbor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , and uh we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> on uh I believe the date was the 23rd of February, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">At least this is what the official exit document that I have states. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Uh my father had a very hard time detaching himself from literally thousands of letters, documents, photographs, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">It was impossible that he could take all of these things that were very dear to him and that meant so much to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">These were letters still written by his mother to him when he was in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Uh his younger brother had fallen for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> eighteen days before the end of World War I. He's buried somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Uh his mother, as I stated before, already died when she was uh a young woman in February of 1919. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">She had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to wait for him as he arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">He had been such a patriot that although the war ended in November of 1918, he had volunteered to fight against the Bolsheviks (ph) and went into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and never came back from the war until February 1919. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Uh she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">She awaited him at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And sometime during that period she contracted as I said the Spanish Influenza. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">She went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Posen</span> and died very shortly thereafter. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And he could not even go to her funeral because he was a German soldier, or ex-soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Posen by this time was Polish and I don't think that he got uh a permit to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Posen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Uh I believe a little bit later on, probably 1920, everyone who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Posen</span> was given the option to opt for either the Polish citizenship or German citizenship, and of course my grandfather uh opted and and part of the other family opted for the German citizenship, and they all went to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So as of 1920, I believe that uh all whoever was left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Posen</span> of the family Gerechter and whatever else their names were all went to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">But to come back to our own family, so I remember so very distinctly my father making arrangements with the superintendent of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we lived, that he could use the <span class="INT_SPACE">furnace room</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and burn all what he couldn't take with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Papers, documents, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">He took some things with him, but very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We were so limited in our baggage and our luggage that it was really uh very difficult to decide what to take and what not to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Uh it came to the point where my mother and father had to go to the uh customs officials and give them, hand them over, their silverware, their candlesticks, their...anything, any objects in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that were made of silver, none of which could be taken along. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">The uh cutlery and uh you know, whatever uh else was of silver in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Uh I do remember my mother going out and being permitted to buy three sets of cutlery, of uh silver-plated cutlery to be taken with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">One for each of us, and nothing more. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And her jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">When they came to the customs official, someone recognized her, an elderly gentlemen and it turned out that one time he worked for my grandfather, possibly ten or fifteen years earlier in his business. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And because he recognized her, he allowed her to take just a few extra items along. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">They were pa...that 1s to say extra items of jewelry, because otherwise all they were permitted really was their wedding rings, and as I said, a set of uh three sets of cutlery for each of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Uh she was allowed very few additional items, and those items were in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , packed in a sealed little package. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I still see the package in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">It was very small and it was sealed with seal-locker, actually sealed, and I guess included was a list of items that were in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And a copy of that list, when we finally left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and crossed the Pass into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , that list was over there with the customs official, officials. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">My parents were taken out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> when we uh passed across the <span class="DLF">border</span> and uh the package at that <span class="NPIP">place</span> was opened up and they compared the list and contents of that package with the list that they had received. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">That's how strict things were handled in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">At any rate, the day of departure arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I remember all night long my parents were still packing. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I remember the last night in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Uh the farewell to toys and everything else and of course the very very sad farewell to my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I still re...see her standing on her <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> and waving at us as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> drove away and took us to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">We left from the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> called and uh I took a doll with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I took a ball with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I remember a little pin that my grandmother had given me and a few other toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And uh we traveled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and slept the first night in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and continued the next day to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">That is to say we crossed the Pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">My parents, not everyone but at random, people were taken out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> ...out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and uh some of them were even uh bodily examined. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Now my mother was taken into one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and my father in another, totally stripped and totally examined and my mother ca---and I was left with the Meyers on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">For some reason the Meyers were not examined. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">As I said, people were taken at random. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And uh remember my mother coming back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and telling us her experience and among other things that the woman who examined her, touched her hair and said what do you have in there, and she said permanent, and uh the woman said don't answer me so fresh. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Well, we finally crossed the and uh - look, some people smuggled things out. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">That's for sure, and we know that and it perhaps even saved their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">It was money smuggled or perhaps between pages of books and it was uh people had false bottoms to their pocketbooks or suitcases - who knows what. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I know that my parents at that point were fearful enough not to do that because the results were well-known. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">They had friends who did this, and whose husband ended up for many years in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and uh we left with the ten marks per person. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">We left with the little package that was packaged in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , and that's all we had with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologne</span> the next day, and uh here we didn't know what we would be doing because the ten marks by now had been used up the one night in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and uh the Meyer family of five and the three stood on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologne</span> and really didn't know where to turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">To our great surprise, uh there were Italian students who uh who were organized by the Jewish Committee uh of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and apparently in many such centers of uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> where <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> would come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , these students had made it their business to be there and uh receive German or other immigrants that were fleeing <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Well, I remember two students taking us in hand, taking us to a beautiful beautiful <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And caring for us for an entire week until we were able to receive money from our relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and the same went for the Meyer family. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Uh the money had to be uh dispatched, and I guess in those days uh telegram was already in existence of course, but I don't know how quickly it went. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">But we were for an entire week taken care of my these students in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologne</span> who also took us around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , showed us <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologne</span> , fed us, took us to <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> , and just took care of us until we were able to uh pay for our uh passage for, first of all from for our ticket, railroad ticket from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologne</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="283">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Now, we were not allowed to pay for these two tripls, because this was out of <span class="REGION">territorial Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">They would not allow us to pay with German money in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for these two tickets, which would have made life a lot easier and, but this were all calculated on the part of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Uh of course we all know that uh supposedly all the money that was uh left and all the jewelry and everything else, all belongings, were put into a socalled uh account, or whatever it was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And uh supposedly someday this all was supposed to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Of course it never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">By the way, speaking of the lift in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , many many years later uh my parents already were no longer alive, and the <span class="BUILDING">German court</span> somehow found out that uh indeed there was a lift stored in a certain man's uh <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> uh which had been distributed. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">The contents of not only our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lift</span> but I suppose many other people's uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lifts</span> , had been distributed to so-called bombed-out German families. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And I received the glorious amount of $400 American dollars, or was it 400 marks - I'm not quite sure anymore - uh maybe sometime in the early early '60's as compensation for the lift. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Anyway, we're now uh in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">As I said we uh were taken care, beautifully taken care of by these people and it is only weeks ago now that I read in a book written by a woman called Susan , . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">She writes about the Italian Jews and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and its Jews, etd. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">It's a fantastic book I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Unfortunately, uh she doesn't mention <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> at all, and I'm trying to get in touch with her which I haven't succeeded in. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Uh I think it's a pity that she doesn't know about <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and the Italian role there. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But uh she is describing this organization of Italians who are helping Jews who come across the <span class="DLF">border</span> to make their life more pleasant and easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And I never realized that this was a nationally organized uh group of people who who did this for a long period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Anyway, we now leave for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bari</span> , and immediately take uh a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and the money that we could afford was only for sturge (ph) or storge (ph) or whatever you call it, in a pl...in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , that is to say down in the in the bottom of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We crossed for twelve hours into <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Everybody was seasick. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">This 1s uh the <span class="REGION">Adriatic Sea</span> in March - can be rough and it was rough I assume. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And we arrived very early the next morning in the <span class="DLF">port</span> or what you might call a port of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="305">My first impression...
QUESTION:  TECHNICAL CONVERSATION End of Tape #1 Tape #2 ...We arrived on March Ist, 1939, in the early, early hours of the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">We went up on board and the site that uh we saw was one of extreme depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">It was a one <span class="DLF">dock</span> and <span class="DLF">port</span> , piles and piles, heaps and heaps of charcoal on the <span class="DLF">pier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">It was pouring rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">The black water was everywhere, running all over the <span class="DLF">pier</span> from the charcoal. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">There were few uh Albanians, for the most part gypsies because they use...used to use gypsies for their heavy work and for carrying and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Covering their, and this I kept seeing it all through the years whenever it rained, these people would use as a protection just the jute bags over their heads and this is was the sight that met our eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">It was really really depressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And I remember my mother crying bitterly and saying I am not leaving this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I am going to straight back to . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">She absolutely could not envision how she would ever be able to set foot to this kind of a unbelievably depressing uh sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Well again to our surprise, because we really had no idea what was expecting us in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , uh there were other immigrants, European immigrants already in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , and someone from the <span class="DLF">pier</span> called up in German, are there any German Jews, are there any Jews on board? </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And uh we were very happy that this gentleman who had already been in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , this was his job to be there every day when <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> arrived to see whether there would be refugees on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And uh so he helped us get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and uh take us to one of the <span class="BUILDING">local hotels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Well ho...<span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> is an overstatement of facts, but that's what they were called. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Exceeding...everything was exceedingly primative. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Uh we had, coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , uh hygiene being the epitomy of our lives and so on, this was really unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But nevertheless here we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Uh I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">We children perhaps because of our age, by this time I had just turned my eighth birthday in December before we left, and uh the uh children of the family Meyer, one was younger - I believe he was only five - and uh the other, the the girls - one was a year older than myself and one was exactly the same age. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So I don't know ta what extent we could empathasize with the feeling our parents experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I think that to us some of this was exciting because it was new and it was different and and it was just all uh a new experience for us children. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I think at this point we uh we were certainly very insecure because we didn't know what was facing us or what <span class="BUILDING">school</span> would be like or the usual things that children do - toys, we had almost none with us, just what we could carry 1n our arms or our little bag that each one of us had over their shoulder, and uh I do remember very well that for many many years the one thing that I missed so terribly was my school bag, and I always had in the back of my mind, well one day when I get to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , my school bag was . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> we used to wear the school bag on your on your back. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I had some particular like for this I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I don't know exactly why, but that was so important to me that I did not have that with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Uh another thing I had received as a gift from an uncle of my mother's a <span class="BUILDING">doll house</span> that he had made himself and of couse I had to leave that behind, needless to say, and that was a tremendous uh and I missed it very badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Well, these are the things that children of that age I think we experiencing. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">The lack of the uh ususal, the schooling, the friends, the <span class="BUILDING">playgrounds</span> , the toys, the family the grandparents, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Uh but the other insecurities of where does the next meal come from or where are we going to live and where are we going to sleep and so on which parents have to worry about, I think that didn't quite trickle down to us at that point yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">At any rate we lived in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , so called <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , very filthy, very dir...very much infested by bedbugs and lice and the whole gambit, and uh the other immigrants and there were at that point I believe something like sixty people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">They were all from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , mostly <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Uh had rented or I should I should start a little bit differently at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">There were Albanian Jews and that is to say there were two families originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> who had lived for many years in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and they were considered Albanian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Uh there names were uh Kohn (ph) and Levy (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="340">They ran rather large <span class="BUILDING">dry goods stores</span> and uh they were weal...very Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Their origin as I say was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solonika</span> (ph) I believe and uh when these other people had arrived a little bit earlier than we, I don't believe that anybody was there more than maybe a year longer than we. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">In other words in 1938 I believe is immigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> started. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Uh these people had sort of assumed the role of uh to the highest to the Joint Distribution in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Made contact with them, and they were sending American dollars to these two families who in turn gave us the Albanian equivalent of this money. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">But in all these years they made very nice uh currency out of these Jews that came to to to escape <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Never mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">At any rate uh these people had organized themselves in uh they had rented a very very large <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , call it a uh a <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> , and uh these sixty people, more or less, were living, a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> per family, in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a very hugh <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">communal kitchen</span> of course, and uh they had uh organized in such a way that several women each day would take turns at cooking and preparing the food and several men would take turns every day 1n purchasing uh the produce etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">and prepare the two meals. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">They were in the process of renting a second such <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the first one but had not completed the arrangements yet so that we for example uh had no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the original <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and had to live in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So 1t was us and uh the Meyer family and there were a couple of other couples or single people who in the meantime were staying in one or the other of these <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I think at that time there were just two. ( ) </span><span class="sentence" id="352">One was called . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">The other one was called, and uh but for meals we had to qo everyday to this <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> which was perhaps not a long way. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I don't really recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I do recall that as a child it was a trecherous waly to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">You have to remember that uh <span class="DLF">roads</span> as such weren't reallly known in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and it was all very uh muddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">This was the rainy season in February and March into April, and uh we had to go twice a day for meals to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , to the uh <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And it wasn't until a few months later, and I'm not quite sure exactly whether it was May or June that the second <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> had been rented and when we could move, be moved in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Uh so this us procedure here went on all through March and into April. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">April 5th, 1939, we woke up to a barrage of cannon uh shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And we didn't quite know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">We were told immediately that the royal family had just uh the Queen of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> had just delivered a uh an heir to the throne and uh they were shooting . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Well that was very nice and the King of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , King uh offered that these sixty or maybe by now sixty-five or seventy immigrants Albanian citizenship in honor of the birth of his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Well, 1t never came to this, which there were times when we wished it had taken place but in the end history proved that it would have been terrible if 1t had happened, because we would never have gotten out of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Two days later we again were awoken by terrible uh noises of artilleries shooting but this time it was the real thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Italians had landed in . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Uh it was the week of Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Passover was early that particular year. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I believe I looked up in my book earlier and I believe that the Seder night was uh on the 3rd or 4th of uh April or 5th of April that year and uh there were rumors that something was happ...going to happen and indeed they had told us that day, on the 6th of uh April, not to come back for supper that night but to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and they gave us some food to take back to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And uh sure enough on the 7th in the morning, 7th of April, 1939, the Italians had landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , had occupied the <span class="DLF">port</span> part of . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">The fighting in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> took uh maybe three, four, five hours at the most. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I don't remember, not too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">But we were staying in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and of course this was one of the uh uh <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> very close to the <span class="DLF">port</span> and uh altogether how many <span class="DLF">streets</span> were in and uh we didn't quite know where to run for shelter because uh the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> had all large <span class="DLF">windows</span> and the shooting was going on and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were being broken, uh the panels were were falling into the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> so we ran up and down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">The <span class="DLF">stairs</span> were a windowless area at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Well, about ten or eleven o'clock in the morning the uh Italians finally came into the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and took us into the nearby uh ( ) solid back. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">It was a solid built <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Uh my mother and I were taken over, followed by my father by some Italian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">They were all very kind and very accommodating and very helpful, but right in front of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> was a machine gun and a dgad Albanian soldier over whom we almost fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Uh we were kept in the all day long, and uh in the mean time of course the rest of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> uh abandoned their fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">The Albanians didn't stand any chance whatsoever and the war was over within a few hours and the Italians were now in possession of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">It's been, it was part of the Italian empire such as , , or parts of <span class="REGION">Africa</span> , etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Uh as far as we were concerned of course the Italians really were to us excellent, wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Uh the word anti- Semitism did not have, not only didn't exist, didn't have any meaning to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">They didn't know what it meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Uh we were Germans at least as far as they were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">When we timidly would tell them they were Jews, their replies would always be well, we have Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and they're Italian citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Some of them are even in the Facist party, which of course is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">We all know by now that there were Italian Jews who were very ardent uh supporters of Facism and such. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">At any rate uh we as I said eventually moved into this other <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> and the Italians were there, and everything was good and fine and uh life went on and here we were waiting for our call-up to the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> because we mustn't forget that this was still the ultimate uh aim. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">We only came here to stay for the few months it would take for the American consule to call us because our to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Well, when the Italians occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , that of course was part of the Axis now, and the American consule left and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I don't know exactly why because that was also uh <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was also uh the Axis but anyway, there was no longer an <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> in and our papers and everything else went with them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> and now we became, we got under the jurisdiction of the ( ) <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Uh the SS was well-known in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Each consule is oh can demand whatever he wants to demand as to security and ( ) uh guarantees that they will not become burdens to the American government. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Indeed this is what happened, and of course we all know that ( ) could have come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , didn't come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> only because of this ( ). </span><span class="sentence" id="397">At any rate we are now in the summer of 1939 and uh our papers are now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> and so are the papers of the Meyer family. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">There were other people who also uh had uh these quota and affadavits to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and some did. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Here and there children kept uh leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and ( ) other <span class="NPIP">places</span> such as <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and of course we know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">A few, very few, went to uh went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">But among them were the Meyer family who in December of 1939 were called to the consule in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> , did leave <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> for <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and eventually arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Uh our quota was not up yet, and we were toying with the idea at one point why not leave with them and stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and wait for our quota, which could have been advantageous and maybe not. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">You can never tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But we ultimately decided to remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and await our call-up. (</span><span class="sentence" id="405">Pause) Life for me at this point was that there were a few other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I think we were five kids altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">In our world we walked, playing, goinlg to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Uh in the meantime our parents organized among themselves individuals who could teach us. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">My father gave us lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">He was an amateur painter. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I have some very lovely paintings of his in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Uh he gave us lessons in art. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I was not one of his pupils. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Uh other people gave us uh lessons in arthimetic and writing and reading, but just to keep us occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">But uh considering the fact that we all are under the impression that we are going to be there just for a few months of time, why bother sending these poor children to uh uh <span class="BUILDING">Albanian schools</span> and let them learn a language that was all the whole world over to speak and a difficult language at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Uh why should we bother? (</span><span class="sentence" id="417">Pause) Uh the opinion of a few people who were there with children. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Uh we the three Meyer children, myself, uh and I think so we were really just little kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Uh so what was my life like? </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Really very uh uneventful I could say. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">You know, we we did obviously uh play in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">We obviously Children will find ways . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Uh eventually when it got to be , LONG . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">At any rate we uneventful life Uh we had a wonderful day. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I remember the day very very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">The water was At any rate we got in the summer of 1939 and you have <span class="BUILDING">outhouses</span> Uh water was brought down by donkey in metal containers from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , from <span class="DLF">natural wells</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">But they didn't, how shall I say, stupidly or uh ignorantly enough people didn't buy blocks of ice and put this into the drinking water in order to cool it. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Well the blocks of ice were made from the regular water, so that by the time we got to drink the wonderful water from the <span class="DLF">wells</span> , it was infested with . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And a lot of, many many people that summer became ill with typhoid fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">All of us had diarhhea and dysentery and and whatever you want to call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">All kinds of intestinal diseases. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">After a while obviously you built up uh antibodies and you you can fight the disease and also you learn to eat the things that the natives eat, one of which is that had uh apparently but in those days we wouldn't touch yougurt with a ten foot pole because we didn't, it wasn't exactly what we liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Uh but we learned to like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And it became a necessity. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And anyway uh the next really traumatic experience in my life was the fact that uh my mother became terribly ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">We were still in the <span class="BUILDING">hostel</span> and it was still the summer of 1939, and she was diagnosed as being, suffering from uh typhoid fever and so she was ill for a good number of weeks before finally somebody decided well it has to be typhoid fever and she was taken by ambulance to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in , , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">capital city</span> but at that time her condition had deteriorated tremendously. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">She ran very high temperatureq for almost a month during which time she was hallucinating constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">She lost a tremendous amount of weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">At the end her disease she weighed something like uh 35 or 40 kilos and uh I didn't see her for uh almost four weeks, and my father feared the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">In fact he didn't take me there because he was afraid that I wouldn't recognize her or or anytime he went there uh he woudn't try to. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">She she couldn't be persuaded to eat or drink any of the, again, what was in those days used really I mean, penecillin was nonexistent. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Sulfur drugs were nonexistent yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">These are things that perhaps would have cured it quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Uh I'm not sure what drugs were being used, but the native cure for typhoid fever is yougurt and milk because both of them evidentally contain certain antibodies that can fight the bacteria. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And she would have none of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So she was for a very long time really very very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">She did come out of it finally. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Some Italian doctor in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> treated her, I'm not sure with what. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">When she finally came back to it was a tremendous joy for me, but in my own life the fear from was a tremendously real one. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Uh I realized that she was very very sick and I realized that the chances that she would die were very real. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And I have to tell you that uh I lost my mother very early in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Uh she was fifty- seven years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">She died of cancer in 1976, in 1961. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And uh that childhood fear of losing my mother had been with me all through uh that time, even though by this time I was myself a mother of three children and I was pregnant with my fourth child. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">But uh losing her was a very real real fear, and I, that I could lose her. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I understood what this fear is all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And and how all these years, from her illness, because she uh came back and maybe misdiagnosed, I'm not sure, but the doctors had claimed that she had come away with a heart defect, which maybe was never real. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">But uh she really never suffered from a heart disease but I think it had inbedded it so much in my mind, and heart meant death, so that I always feare for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I was always afraid that she was working too hard even after we came to to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">That she was working too hard, that she was over- doing it, that; she may have a heart condition and that she may die of a heart attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Of course she didn't have a heart condition I don't believe uh and she suffered for about a year from cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">She passed away as said at fifty-seven and really both my parents never recover from in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">My father, he did have a heart condition, did die at sixty-five, ten weeks after my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So at any rate, uh ( ) I finally had my mother back and it took her a long time to recover and to get her strength back. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And in the meantime in December of '39 our . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">The Meyers left and so I really was left only with one little girl who wasn't even Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Her mother wasn't Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">She had followed her husband who was a Jew from uh <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> and we became very good friends, but uh we played together and we lived together that entire winter on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Now I'am not sure at this point how many people in number, but we were still a substantial number of families who by this time had to move out of the two <span class="BUILDING">hostels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Number one we weren't enough people anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I don't think that we were more than maybe twenty-five or thirty people, not families. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Uh many had left as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Some to other European cities and some to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">The two <span class="BUILDING">hostels</span> became too expensive and we had to give them up and what we did do was that in September of '39 we found ourselves little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> along the <span class="DLF">beach</span> which belonged to affluent Albanians from the major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> who would spend their summer vacations there, but in the winter were perfectly willing for I suppose reasonable rent to give us their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and that's what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And it was quite pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Obviously for kids to live along the <span class="DLF">beach</span> and in the wintertime and during uh uh storms and and it was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Uh well uh, but winter went quite alright except for one small incident and that was ( ) it was a fairly cold winter, '39 and '40, and the only means of uh heating in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> was with charcoal. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I mean electricity was non-existent uh or means were unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">People cook and people heat with charcoal. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">It's called in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And uh the only other means was what is called which is uh little uh uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">heating units</span> fed by uh petroleum, kerosene, but uh obviously you only cook on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">You can't heat with it, so it was a and even though we never slept with it, this particular night was a particularly cold one, and we left it in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">It's very dangerous because it gives off uh carbon monoxide. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And uh for some reason or other I woke up in the middle of the night not feeling well, and woke up my mother who immediately realized that she also didn't feel well, and neither did my father and we almost had succumbed to uh carbon monoxide poisoning. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">He had the presence of mind, my father, to open the <span class="DLF">door</span> which led immediately led right out to the open into the uh onto the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , and we really rolled down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and spent the entire night lying in, on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> in the cold but recovered enough to in the morning be alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">But we had almost, this was almost it. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And uh we stayed on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">We moved several times because meanwhile the owner... End of Tape #2 Tape #3 ... uh the situation was getting very cloudy. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">invade <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> and we are not considered Jews who had escaped <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but we are considered uh non wanted enemy aliens. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">As enemy aliens we couldn't remain in a strategic <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like was and we were deported to the interior of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And , <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> used by the uh Albanians and I suppose was used uh prior to this by the Turks, and prior to this perhaps even by the Romans, uh as a city of internment. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Uh it is about, it's a valley, a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ina valley surrounded by very high <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , and there are only certain passes that lead out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And you don't even have to be behind but you simply cannot get out unless you go through certain <span class="DLF">mountain passes</span> that are guarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And uh they deported us, however many of us were left at that point, to the city of . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">We arrived there probably October or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Yes, by the, by the high holidays we were already in . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And at this point we were taken over by the Albanian government. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Uh you have to remember that meanwhile the uh Axis had declared war, the entire Axis declared war on the United Stateq, uh and I skipped here something very important and that is that in uh May, May 8th, 1940, the American consul had finally invited us to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> to receive our visas to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Uh this was a very important episode in our lives and my parents immediately went to the ministry appropriate <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> in trying to get a permit to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , not so much to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> as to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and uh in the meantime the Italian government received instructions from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> not to allow Jews to enter uh <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And uh one other friend of ours in uh the same position as ourselves who had just been called to the American Consultate in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> and who had rece...gotten the entry visa into the uh <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , was already in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and was called off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> because the Italian official in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> had received - he didn't want to open the tele...the telegram because he knew what was going to, what the contents was. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Uh someone else forced him to open it and he had to take this man off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and the man spent the rest of the war . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But we didn't get that far because our invitation came maybe a week or two later and by that it had become official policy not to allow Jews officially into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">We were stuck. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And that entire summer, the whole summer of 1940, my parents used up every last penny of money that they had had to travel between and to go to each and every one, anyone who would listen to them they would go to and try to get permission to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and it just - and there were wonderful Italian officials in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> who sincerely wanted to help, who tried every trick of the trade, and it just was not possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I think my father's very last endeavor was to pay a visit to the Viceroy in. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">On uh a <span class="DLF">hilltop</span> in was a <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> of the King which of course was then occupied by what was called the Viceroy of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and uh who was a representative of the Emperor of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albjania</span> , and uh Yakamony (ph) was his name, and to present him with the case and ask for his personal intervention and help. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And again uh it was quite unbelievable how uh wonderful, naive and helpful Italians really tried to be including the Viceroy. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">He happened to be 1n the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and even though one of the guards who saw my father wanted to ask him to leave the <span class="DLF">grounds</span> because he was really not permitted, the Viceroy asked what does this gentlemen want. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Please let him in. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And my father presented his case personally to the Viceroy who said he would try his utmost and see what he can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So much so that after we were already in and it was the winter, must have been at least four or five months later, one morning two , two Italian policemen came with a scroll under their arm, with the answer from the Viceroy, and in formal fashion opened or unwound this this this document and read that His Majesty, the Viceroy Yakamony regrets to inform the Senor Gerechter (ph) that he tried his utmost and that the official law is that no Jews can enter, or whatever it said, but something to this effect, can enter <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Therefore his effort remains unsuccessful. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And we were stuck in. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">We tried uh yet during that same summer to uh get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , hoping to perhaps get through the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">The uh <span class="BUILDING">Greek Consul</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> proved to be a very great . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Didn't do anything to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">We even at one time tried to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Istanbul</span> but that too was impossible uh As I say, we were stuck for six and a half years. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Every effort remained unsuccesful. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">We arrive in in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> I'm sorry - skip that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">We arrived in uh in the fall of 1940, and uh the war with <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> started pretty soon thereafter with the Albanian government at this point uh took over the handling of these few Jews ( ). </span><span class="sentence" id="524">They uh issued a certain amount of for our support which was . </span><span class="sentence" id="525">They did uh provide us with <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> or did we have to pay for it - I'm not sure but we ended up to live in a very typical <span class="BUILDING">Turkish Moslem harem</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="526">A hugh, absolutely hugh hugh <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was constructed in a very strange way, at least to my way of thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I suppose this is how harems are constructed. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Uh when I say hugh I mean hundreds of meters of uh <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> between the two sides of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">One one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> was an anteroom (ph) and on the other side of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , another <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , was an <span class="INT_SPACE">anteroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">The <span class="INT_SPACE">anteroom</span> is where the guard of the harem ladies uh stays and the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> is where the harem ladies lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">The in-between is just the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> uh and a <span class="INT_SPACE">men's kitchen</span> , which was unbelievably . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It had a clay <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> I remember, and lots and lots of rats and mice walking around in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Uh no uh bathroom facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">None whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">An <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> , even in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like this, and uh I guess we did find an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">outdoor bathtub</span> which I guess was used by the ladies of the <span class="BUILDING">harem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">At any rate by the time we arrived there this uh uh so called <span class="BUILDING">harem</span> which I assume at one point must have been the uh glorious and splendid ediface, was completely run down. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">There were hardly any uh glass uh panels in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I remember that we covered the uh <span class="DLF">windows</span> with blankets and ( ) a rather cold winter because this is much more northlernly located than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> and it was a very cold winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Uh we were living, well for me first of all, 1t was fun again. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">A huge <span class="DLF">garden</span> , pomgranites (ph) grew in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I picked them. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And low and behold there was a dog, a female dog, a bitch in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> somewhere, who had given birth to these three little puppies. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And must have happened just as we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">To me this was great excitement. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Very good uh much fun, and uh one morning, by chance, I saw an Albanian boy who had chased the mother away and was about to take the puppies away. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And the puppies were no more than uh maybe a week or two old - they didn't see yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">In other words they really were very little, and uh I guess my father must have told me that I may have one of these puppies. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So I argued with this young uh boy and indeed he did give me the puppy that I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">It was a white and black puppy. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And uh now I had my puppy. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And I called my puppy Picholo (ph) even though it was a female and she should have been called Pichola (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="552">But uh she remained Picholo for the three and a half years of her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And uh she grew into a very loving and lovely little dog, absolutely 57 varieties, but that didn't bother me. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Uh we had to, we fed her literally with a uh milk bottle that belonged to one of my dolls I suppose and uh I don't even know where we got the milk from because I'm sure my mother didn't have enough milk for me, but I do remember that she bought the uh can of condensed milk and watered that down, and that's what the poor little puppy lived on for a while, and I also remember that one day she made some cream of wheat and it burned on these wonderful uh cooking facilities, and somehow that became food for this baby uh dog, puppy, for a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">As long as it was sour - the burned cream of wheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Anyway uh that was the uh central point of my life at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">The dog was everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">The dog meant a great deal to me, and uh my parents very much liked this dog as well, so I didn't have any difficulties uh keeping the dog in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I could keep the dog with me all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And uh I, we really became very close friends and it became uh a I had no other choice or friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">The dog was a very uh central part. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Uh the war with <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , between <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and uh Ital...<span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> started very shortly thereafter. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">We lived very close to a <span class="BUILDING">mosque</span> , and uh what we didn't know was that the <span class="BUILDING">mosque</span> had been used by the Italians as a storage place for ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">The <span class="DLF">front line</span> was quite close. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">At night we could see the artillery fire, the flashing uh flaming up of of projectiles - we could see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And uh the city of or this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of was bombed very very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">The first time we were bombed I remember very clearly I probably had a cold or something - I was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">My father was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">One other of our uh friends was with us, and my mother had left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to get bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">At this time things begin to be rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Now ration never became a great problem in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">There wasn't that much of a variety of food to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Uh I cannot say that uh we lacked food because of ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I can say we lacked food because of money and we couldn't afford anything, uh but it wasn't so much that there wasn't any food because of rationing. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Uh the few things that there were, we you know, we could have obtained, but we really didn't have any money, and there was a period exactly around this time that from the money that the Albanian government gave us, and I have a great recollection that this was on the order of four or four and a half lechs (ph) a day and I do remember actually going hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">There was a period that my mother stole fruit and tomatoes out of the neighbor's <span class="DLF">garden</span> because there was really no food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Uh what eventually happened is again uh somehow through my relatives for a short period of time they were able to send some money via an <span class="BUILDING">Italian bank</span> and I'm I'm not, I can't remember how it was done uh to send us some money uh or through the Red Cross perhaps it was handled - Im' not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">But I do remember receiving once or twice a little bit of money from the uh uh from the from from our relatives in uh in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and that helped us to bridge the <span class="DLF">gap</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I mentioned before the fact that my father was an amateur painter. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Uh we had in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> some beautiful paintings which are all gone - I mean obviously they all went with the rest of the stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Uh and his motifs had at that time been motly uh Judeic but I have a very good collection of the paintings in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Concord</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Uh he decided that he had to make some money and uh somehow got the idea to paint uh store signs for Albanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Very colorful with pictures of the merchandise that they were selling and believe it or not they really wanted them and they really bought them, and that helped us tremendously. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And for quite a while he uh was able to sort of uh put some food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> through making these uh signs and and painting these these signs for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">He later on really went back and painting and uh I have in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> 1n uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> , and my children also have some paintings that were done by him, still while we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Uh he did paint uh in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> when he came uh to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> in '46, '47, but uh this uh did help us along, but I still remember very well the couple of weeks where we actually did not have any food uh on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Uh we uh some Ital...Albanian families became very friendly, our neighbors, and uh even invited us to the uh Moslem festival of Ramadan (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Of course today, living in 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , we always know when Ramadan takes place, and uh uh being that they go according to a lunar calendar and don't adjust their calendar it can come out any time of the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Uh that year I guess it was sort of winter time, and uh it uh well it's the uh four weeks of fasting, but the two days at the end of uh this fasting period are great festivities and festivities are mostly food. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And uh they have some very lovely, as we learned there and uh it's very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="592"><span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> is (TECHNIC'AL CONVERSATION). </span><span class="sentence" id="593">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">At any rate uh they took them with us to the <span class="BUILDING">mosque</span> and they uh treated us as uh their guests and they're exceedingly hospitable and they sent us frequently to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Uh and we remained in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for I believe at least half a year if not more, but the situation with the bombardment on the part of the Allies, Eng...uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British planes</span> , <span class="DLF">air</span> , the British Air, Royal Air Force planes came over to bomb the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> detracted from that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I was ill that day and my mother had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to get bread because there were only certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they distributed bread during the day, uh and my father saw these five or seven <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> , and no sooner had he seen them, then they started throwing bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">There was no <span class="DLF">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Absolutely no shelter, real <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelters</span> as we came to know them. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Uh nobody knew what to believe was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">The aim was the <span class="BUILDING">mosque</span> because of the ammunition and possibly other parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> also had ammunition and uh the soldiers uh were you know sent back to the <span class="DLF">lines</span> into where they would rest for a few days, so this became very much a target, a daily target. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Our only <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> became a very thick <span class="BUILDING">stone building</span> , that's the only way I can describe it, which the Moslems used to wash their dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Uh and uh that was the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">It is windowless and it was not very far from our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but during the night, or anytime, we had to run for shelter to this one uh <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , blut it's a very very uh solidly built uh <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> out of out of very hugh stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Uh but the situation became such that uh they would come eight or ten times a day to bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I mean you couldn't go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">You couldn't undress. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">There were weeks we wouldn't undress because in the middle of the night you would have to run several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Uh it became such that you couldn't dare uh undress yourself to even wash yourself in the basin in your <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> because they would come to bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Uh one day a high Italian official came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and my mother, not being bashful, approached him in the parade and said it's impossible for us to remain here. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I have a little child, and uh could we get permission, because here we were sent here by the Italian governing forces, uh could I get permission to go to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was called , also small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Even a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">But there was nothing as strategic or military about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And he said come Monday morning to . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I will give you a permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">She did. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">He did give her the permit, and we went, we moved once again to this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Well, we all know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">The Italians dreadfully failed in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">The Germans landed on the island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Crete</span> , and several other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and occupied all of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , and I believe by June or July of that year, 1941, ( ) the was was over and uh we were given permission to return to We could go back to , so that was we were no longer undesirable aliens or enemy aliens and uh we had had enough of these uh little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Now I have to add here that uh was so infested with mosquitos ( ) my mother and I came down with uh very severe cases of malaria. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Somehow my father uh escaped that, but uh my mother had just barely recovered from ( ) and I was eventually trelated with ( ) medication and I will come to that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">At any rate, ( ) was not very long, maybe two or three months and then eventually we were allowed hack into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Now at this point there is war everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Uh the Joint no longer can support us in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">They no longer had uh could contact or connections. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">The Albanian government is no longer responsible for us because now we have left the city of internment and uh we uh went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> , found ourselves a little uh what shall I call it - really only a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and and a little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> uh in a on a <span class="DLF">peasant's farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">The peasants lived in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we lived in the front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And there was an <span class="INT_SPACE">upstairs room</span> and <span class="DLF">porch</span> as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">But we were really about a kilometer or two away from the <span class="DLF">highway</span> , on the other side of the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , and uh I'm only describing it because eventually this becomes ( ) and the Italians were in possession of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">This is the summer of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Uh many Italians did not sympathize with the Facist government and who therefore were not interested to serve in the armies, or who had been already in the African war and no longer were interested in fighting another war, could, I understood at that time, volunbeer to do uh Army or military service in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> in the capacity of uh to supply the army in the various <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they were staying or just, I don't know - I'm really not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">But there were a great deal of need for ( ). </span><span class="sentence" id="633">There's no railroad system in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> or very primative one. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I I'm not even sure that there was a railroad or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I think th,ere Railroad was transported uh charcoal to the various <span class="NPIP">places</span> , but this was not a uh a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I think toda,y there is such a thing, railroad, out there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">All the transportation Albania basically was conducted by old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggies</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">There were almost no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">When the Italians came with the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and uh uh food supplies, charcoal supplies and whatever uh military supplies were needed, they took care of them, so that they were living along the whole, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Now this was no longer a question of Albanians wanting to rent their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">They were rather uh requisitioned by the Italians for their uh truck drivers, and many of them even came with their families to to spend the duration of the, what they thought the duration of the war would now be. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">END OF TAPE OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Uh we were back I believe in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">We were, OK, at this point uh we were no longer being supported as I said by the Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">We were no longer supported by the uh uh Albanian government and uh working permit as such was impossible to obtain. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">You have to remember that this is a very small <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with a very limited uh industry and very limited resources of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Uh and so my father once again resorted to his painting. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Uh he continued actually what he had started in , uh in, to paint the store signs and uh he even got. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">some uh jobs with the uh highway department to do signs where construction was taking place and things of this sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">However, that didn't really amount to mu...enough money and at this time, at this point, we were living out of the, out in the uh on the uh <span class="DLF">farm</span> , if you want to call 1t a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , but that's really what it was, and uh together with yet another family, friends of ours, and uh the two families, my parents and these people, Mundle (ph) was their name, Feenie (ph) and Walter (ph) Mundle, uh decided that they were going to uh wash laundry for Italian uh truck drivers. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Uh if I think back of the uh laundry business, I somehow have to chuckle. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">The automatic washers and the automatic dryers and the running water and the hot water and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I don't know what they used for so...for soap, quite obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">One of the things that was uh popular in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> to use was the the ashes of charcoal. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">It's fantastic to clean your clothes with. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I don't know how fantastic, but that was one of the additives to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">washing machine</span> , to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">washer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">washing machine</span> consisted of a uh uh tin cylindric uh bucket I guess you could call it, tall, fairly tall bucket with a little kind of a uh tube! </span><span class="sentence" id="658">in the middle into which you put charcoal and you lit the charcoal and that would warm up the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Now if you were not carefull enough and you had your laundry touch that part of the kettlel, uh you could even get it burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">At any rate, 1t would be boiled in there, and then it would be put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , scrubbed with a brush, and of course rinsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Now my job in all of this was to pull water from the uh <span class="DLF">well</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">We had a little <span class="DLF">well</span> in the uh in our, in front of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but that was the drinking water and the washing water and every other kind of water, and uh if it was towards the summer and in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> it doesn't rain like 1n in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> you only have a rain period, uh the water very quickly gets exhausted and ( ) bottom of your <span class="DLF">well</span> and then you have to wait for several hours to start filling up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">At any rate I, that was my job - to fill up buckets and buckets of water uh for the laundry, for washing and for drying the laundry. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And of course then the laundry was hung in the <span class="DLF">back yard</span> and my mother would iron, and again, ironing was done with a steam iron, but a big heavy uh tron iron, which opened up and you put burning charcoal into it in order to heat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">How do you iron without heat? </span><span class="sentence" id="666">All of these things today are laughable but they weren't so laughable then. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">They were pretty serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">It was a living for us for a good number of years, at least two, two, two and a half years and uh my parents continued doing this sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">What did I do in all of this time? </span><span class="sentence" id="670">My dog was with me for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Out in the on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , this only danger really was uh snake bites and that was not so far-fetched and it was also dangerous for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">In fact my mother once found a snake in her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> when she went at night to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Uh the uh thing that I I had a carefree life in the sense that schooling as such for a while I didn't attend. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Again, all through the uh month or however long we were in the two uh little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in the center of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , in and , other immigrants were teaching me. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I did a great deal of reading and I today speak, read, and write a perfect German and it's only due to the efforts of all these lovely people and my own tremendous hunger for reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I read a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Whatever came into my hand, be it Italian or be it German, I read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And this was really the basis of my uh education until I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at the age of 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Uh my parents however they did it is still is a uh miracle and uh a puzzle to me, but they kept me uh fairly hap...uh happy and well-adjusted child. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I can't say that I uh was not well-adjusted and I cannot say that I had a terrible childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">The dangers perhaps I didn't understand that well. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Uh for a part of our life in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> we were more or less safe and and secure. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Uh the uh lack of uh material values wasn't that something that mattered to me as a child so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">We lived out on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">That was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">There was a cow. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I learned to milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I had some chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Uh I collected their eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Uh eventually my mother found out that there was an afternoon Italian school taught by nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">She registered me and she took me there uh and I started learning how to read and write Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Uh the following school year I was actually registered into the third grade - I had gone in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> just to the first grade and a few month,s into the second grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">They took me into the third grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was taught by nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">It is always my favorite thing to say that I was taught by uh I was taught in a <span class="BUILDING">nunnery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Uh nuns did teach me, and they were lovely. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">They were very good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">They knew I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">There were some kids 1n the class as well, but for one year, one <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year, I really lived a normal, uh student life. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I went in the morning to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Uh we had to dress in uniforms like all Italian children. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">A black smock with a white collar and a blue big bow. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Uh the nuns were good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">They were not pressuring unduly let's say honestly. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Nuns do not walk by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">They're always accompanied by someone, and so at times I would accompany my favorite nun from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to her uh domicile which was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in in uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">She would ask me to come to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with me, to take her to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Uh she would occassionally say, why, why don't you kneel down and pray with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Nothing will happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And besides, why do you people suffer so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">You really could save your suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">But that was the most that I ever experienced in uh uh the sense of being pressured into uh accepting or believing in Catholicism. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I have to honestly say they never pressured us. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">They never, no one every talked about baptism or anything of that sort at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">So for one year, as I said, I had a very normal childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the morning, and I loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I loved it so much that in the morning when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I regreted the fact that another day was going by, and it was one less day of going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> till the vacation came. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And this was the only year - this is the year 1942-43. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Uh ( ) we had also uh made friends with an Albanian family. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Uh their name is . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">He was a construction or a civil engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">She was German, and they had two sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Uh most Albanians who study anything - there was no <span class="BUILDING">university</span> uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> - uh Ivan studied in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> or studied in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , perhaps he even went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">But this was the norm. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Anybody who uh had a profession had been to study abroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And uh this particular engineer had studied in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and met and married a German woman, who I assume had had adapted uh herself to the religion - I don't know what the procedure of becoming a Moslem woman is or not, but she certainly brought up her children in the Moslem faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Uh interesting individual and uh I'd like to dwell on her for a moment only because it is such a very typical story. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">We were her so-called court Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">She was such a strong supporter of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">In her <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> she had a tremendous colored portrait of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Her, she came from which is the beginning, which was the beginning of Hitler's little band of supporters. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">She enjoyed telling us of the fact that uh in the late twenties and early thirties when national socialism was still illegal in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , during the Republic, uh secret meetings with Hitler took place in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of her father's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and you cannot, she would tell me mother, the charisma of this man, these eyes - I mean and she would really go into all kinds of esctasy describing this ( ) phenomenal human being that this Hitler was and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">But she was Albanian and she lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , I mean in in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , and she was a a good woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">She would come out to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> where we lived and bring us food, and uh when the chips were down, that is to say in 1943 when uh, well I don't have to repeat the history which is already known, but eventually the Germans regarded the Italians as their enemies and they actually occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , and uh to the extent where they deported the Italians by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , via back into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And they became the rulers of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Albsnia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Uh at this point, it became very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">We were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> - oh, I have really skipped something that is most important, and where the family came in very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Uh a little bit earlier on, I suppose it must have been - well, let's go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I I'm afraid we have to go back to 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">In 1942, first of all the Germans are occupying <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , and a group of maybe approximately a hundred Yugoslave Jews accomp...came across the <span class="DLF">border</span> at , and the Albanians let them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Uh here the Italians are still the rulers of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , together with the Albanians, and these! </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Jews are escaping uh and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Uh the Germans had bombarded <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgrade</span> for twenty-four solid hours, at the end of which they marched into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and some of these Jews were able to escape really literally escape by the <span class="DLF">back door</span> when the Germans already entered the <span class="DLF">front door</span> , and uh made their way to the uh <span class="DLF">Albanian border</span> and came across. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And uh there were there were about a hundred of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Eventually we met them. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">We are now in 1942, and even another interesting uh point that I didn't uh mention I'll briefly mention it, in this little uh <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , an Italian family eventually moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Our friends the Mundles, left the laundry, quote, unquote - did something else with, for a living, for a livelihood. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And an Italian family moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">He was a truck driver, and uh he rented the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> while his wife was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> giving birth to their first child. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And uh she would be coming within a month's time with this baby, and indeed, this child was born, Elsa (ph) is her name, was born on the 13th of February, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">why do I know this date? </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Because that night, some Italian soldiers tried to break into our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Upstairs nobody lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Our neighbors, the the farmer who was living in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , didn't hear us and uh we lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> of course, and it was a Friday night and suddenly we realized that the <span class="DLF">window</span> was being opened from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And our little dog, Picholo, jumped through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and he was the saving grace. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Italians are very frightened of dog bites because of course rabies in those days was quite prevalent and was not being controlled. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And uh if they would be bitten by a dog they would have had to report to their uh health authorities and where did you get the bite. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Well, they let the <span class="DLF">window</span> fall down, and ran away, and we didn't hear from them, but again, this was the most frightening experience and uh the dog barked half the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Never came back until the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And really saved our life! </span><span class="sentence" id="762">There's no two ways about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">These two soldiers, and they were from the , the ones with the feathered hats uh and they came with that uniform on. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I mean they were out to get some money obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">But you never know what else they came out uh they were out for, and uh we reported them the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">That whole night we stayed up and uh we set and it was a very bad experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And uh the next morning we informed the uh nearby, it was nearby, an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Italian army camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">The officer was informed. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">They came. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">They investigated. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">They asked us to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">They had the entire batallion or however many soldiers there were, uh stand at attention and asked us to identify. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Uh my parents decided not to identify, even if they had the slightest doubt that this soldier or that soldier was the person. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Is impossible at night to have recognized them. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Uh they you know involve themselves into such a trap, and they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">We never were uh bothered again, but it never never was a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> again for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Uh we lived as I said about a mile and a half or two miles away from the <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">We had to go out at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">We had to uh deliver the laundry, or things of this sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">We always had the dog with us, as little as she was, but our uh landlord did two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">One, he had a big German Shepherd dog who that night was away from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because they never fed the dog and the dog all night long used to roam around finding food, but from here on in, he put the dog on a uh uh wire that ran around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and uh fed the dog well. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And the other thing was he made a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in our, between our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and his so that in case something like this would happen again, we would have an <span class="DLF">escape route</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">We had to escape otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Well, be that said. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Meanwhile the Italian family moved in, and their name is . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Last winter we were 1n (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">So uh it's the uh fall of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Uh we went, we heard that the Greek, not Greek, the Yugoslave immigrants who had come across the <span class="DLF">border</span> were now mostly living in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> called . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And we were looking ( ). </span><span class="sentence" id="790">You have to realize that all these years went by and we really never had a. We never were enough men uh to have a proper service. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">We were observant to the point that we could be observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Uh we had one other family friends who were observant. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Nobody else was. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Uh there was no kosher food and I don't intend to uh say that we didn't eat meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">We did eat meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">We did not obviously eat pork, but other than that, kosher could not be kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Uh there was little enough food as it was, the little we could get, but uh still whatever we could keep, we kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Uh Friday night was kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">was kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">My parents did not wash laundry on Saturdays, and little things like this, but all things which really did give me the feeling that this was a Jewish and an observant <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Uh we were looking for a and we, my parents decided to take a trip to uh and uh we went to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> I believe and we really did have a with these Yugoslave Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Uh I have to tell you here that it was the first time that we heard of some of the serious German atrosities. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">There were people there whose uh sons, husbands, were taken into a nearby <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and shot by the Germans as they had occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Uh some of these people had escaped by the skin of their teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Literally, some of them told us that the Germans entered the <span class="DLF">front door</span> and they ran out the <span class="DLF">back door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Uh there were those who were, I remember there was one family, an elderly lady with her grandaughter, and that was all that was left of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Uh a bomb had hit the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Half of the people in the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> were blown away and thereby saved she and her grandchild on her lap, while her daughter or son, whoever it was, and uh other children of the family had been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I mean instances of this type. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">We had never heard of any of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I do remember them asking us questions and uh us telling them about the Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">That was our only experience with real terror and real harrassment and and and uh atrocities. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Uh that was the fall of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">As I said '42-'43 I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> uh and again uh as far as my parents were concerned by birthdays came and went. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Uh they couldn't afford birthday presents, but I did have a doll and they would sit at night when I slept, and we always had only one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> - never had more than one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> - and uh sit in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and sew doll clothes out of grown-out clothes of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">My mother would uh discard some of her own clothes and make them smaller for me, because here, remember in 1939 I was uh eight years old and the clothes had all by now been grown out by me. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">I was in the meantime ten and eleven years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Uh now uh <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> is occupied by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Our real problems started. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">This is summer of 1943 and uh we heard about it, and uh once before my parents had a very uh close call. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">They walked on the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , and the one and only really bad uh Albanian police officer whom we met throughout all these years, had recognized them, stopped his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and asked his uh assistant to imprison them, to put them in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , because they had no right to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">He wanted them back in either or , an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">He did want them in his city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And uh the only thing my parents were able to do was to inform this engineer , whom until now we had only known on a social basis, that his wife invited us to Christmas party or uh her Easter party, and uh came to us and brought us food when we lived out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and uh they immediate...I had been left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by myself, so she came and she took me to her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at the <span class="DLF">beach</span> where they lived, they lived year-round, and uh he, it took him about four or five days to uh get my parents out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="826">They were in solitary confinement. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">My mother, my mother and my father both didn't speak any Albanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">You can imagine the kinds of criminals that they were imprisoned with. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Uh my poor mother, who was absolutely petrified of any uh rodents was here imprisoned with women who at night put out loaves of bread so that the rats would eat the bread rather than attack them. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">It was real horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">It was unbelievable horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Uh and after four days they finally were freed and came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">This was only a few months before the Germans, maybe only a month before the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="834">As soon as the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , this engineer took my father to a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="835">I, it was called . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">It fell in the northern part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , a tiny <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where he was doing some construction work, and he passed my father off as an assistant to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">He lodged him with some peasant: or something, I I'm not quite sure, but my poor father spoke very little Italian and not a word of Albanian, so for him this was sheer torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">I mean it was really very very terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And my mother and I were taken in by the family as their relatives, as her German relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">This woman, with all her Nazi background, never never gave us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">My mother was a distant relative who was living with them, helping in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I was the child. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">But now you have to understand that she was known in the German circles of Albanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">She wasn't the only German. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">There was a whole colony of Germans, and they would get together at Christmas and they used to have festivals and who knows what not. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I mean there was a whole group of these Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">Some of them probably were sympathisizers and some of them were not so much - I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">But she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And uh, but here she and we lived with them for maybe - I don't know - possibly two or three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">What was terribly uncomfortably obviously was, but again I was a child and the whole impact of this probably never registered with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">My mother on the other hand, for her it was very . </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Uh German officers, SS officers, or SS officers, or whatever it was, went in and out of this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="852">She was a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">She lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Her father was well-known and uh she became quite a social uh uh personality at that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Uh there was one particular officer who came very frequently to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and uh my mother used the name of Rechter (ph) instead of Gerechter. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">Rechter happens to be a German name and uh fairly common so that it wasn't, that difficult to uh to uh you know trace it in any which way. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">U'h for some reason they never asked where's your husband or whatever, or maybe he was uh considered by them to be on a <span class="DLF">front line</span> or in the Reich (ph) fighting or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">But the conversations that took place became exceedingly uh difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Uh this one particular officer told my mother point blank, if I were ever faced with a communist or a Jew, I would kill them on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And uh I don't know how she kept her posture, her composure or her charm, but she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Uh she was a tiny woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">No, no taller than myself and maybe half my size, and uh yet very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And uh indeed a few days after this particular conversation, we uh one day at noon time heard a terrible noise not far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I mean an explosion, terrible noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And uh what had happened was that this very same officer had taken a hand grenade and thrown it at random in a passing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> which was loaded with Italian soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">They now had become his enemies, I mean, you know what the Germans thought of the Italians, uh and uh he just out of the sheer fun of it threw this grenade and probably killed and wounded everyone that was in that particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And this happened on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> which was only a few hundred meters away from this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="868">My father uh really got into such a state of uh psychological state I should say, that uh his only contact was when engineer would go to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and talk to him for uh an hour or so, but other than that he had no no human contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">What we didn't know was that there was one family who had been among those who had escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and they actually, the family, uh husband and wife, young couple, they had actually settled in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I don't know what they did for a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And uh uh they had seen this man - now I have to add, this 1s true - my father did not typically look Jewish, whatever this may mean, and I'm saying this with tongue in cheek because I really don't believe in this uh kind of thing, but yet he wa...had a very light complexion, uh more or less the kind of uh upturned nose like I do, and he didn't, he he looked quite German. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Uh and the...he probably wore one of those berets, and uh leather boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">They had seen him in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and they were absolutely petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">They thought ah-ha, there is a uh Fifth (ph) Column person trying to find Jews, and they actually went in hiding for the duration of his stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">He found this out only many many months later. ( ) </span><span class="sentence" id="876">to as well and then met my father one day and told him this story, so he could have passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">You know a human contact so much for that but he almost became blind because of psychological stress. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">He could not take this any longer, and uh decided he's going to come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="879">He's not going to no longer stay in uh by himself, and he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And we rented a uh, we had remember uh lived for all this time with this family. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Our <span class="NPIP">place</span> out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , we still had our things there, but we were kind of afraid to go there because a small German group of soldiers had sort of set up a camp nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">In fact this was really the way we Saw one morning German soldiers 1n the <span class="DLF">field</span> with machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">And uh so everybady knew we were Jewish and after my father came back END OF TAPE ..continental waters of the <span class="REGION">Indian Ocean</span> , you know, what do you call it, uh <span class="REGION">Albanian waters</span> and then hopefully get their motors to work and get uh I don't know how many of these I only know that once again surprisingly enough this woman with her strong Nazi background and her husband would patrol the <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="884">Patrol the <span class="DLF">beach</span> , walk up and down as though they were taking a walk along the <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Then these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> and if any German soldier would come along they would engage him in conversation until the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> could leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Do you believe that? </span><span class="sentence" id="887">That's how . </span><span class="sentence" id="888">At any rate I know of one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and set out a few nights later again, and that there was full moon they couldn't dare. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">They could only go when there was no moon. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I mean it was a very dangerous undertaking and as I say I have no way of knowing whether anybody ever made it . </span><span class="sentence" id="891">Anyway uh we happened . </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Many Albanians have gone underground, young people have gone underground, have joined the Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="893"><span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> had its own partisan group under the command of who lived until just a few years ago, and all them were together under the command of Tito (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Uh in the northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , obviously, uh the activities were much uh stronger than in the parts of uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> or or anywhere around there. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Uh but mountaneous areas were completely infested by uh Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And uh here also uh throughout the years, uh the Italian con...uh truck drivers had a very hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Their <span class="BUILDING">convoys</span> were usually attacked and emptied out and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I mean this was how they made their living, and this is where they got their food and their substenance. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">There's no way where they got uh money or food or anything or or ammunition or weapons from the uh Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">But anyway uh the Germans were out to look for Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And we had been warned that uh we should stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as little as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Of course they would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">It was Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And uh we really did uh heed this warning and we walked along the <span class="DLF">beach</span> and we were maybe some other visited maybe some other immigrants and together we went some other <span class="DLF">pllace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">We simply were not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Maybe three or four days after uh Rosh Hashanah uh my mother was sweeping the <span class="DLF">steps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="909">Now the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we lived in, it was that uh was really a <span class="BUILDING">wooden shack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="910">It was a <span class="BUILDING">summer home</span> again of two German families who lived in They shared this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and each one really consisted of one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and little <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="911">Each one opening out into the <span class="DLF">front porch</span> and the <span class="DLF">porch</span> had a few steps into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> and that's that's the extent of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">No, no uh bathroom facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">An <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> in the back of it, and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">So uh it was maybe seven, eight o'clock in the morning, I'm not sure, and my mother was sweeping the <span class="DLF">front steps</span> when out of no where a German officer with a few soldiers appeared and said, uh , I have been looking for you for several days already and I never find you at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And my mother had the presence of mind to lock the <span class="DLF">door</span> of my father, of my father's <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> - he was upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">He was luckily still in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , just getting up she locked the <span class="DLF">door</span> from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And took the key out. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And uh he proceeded to tell her that two days ago, exactly when it was Yom Kippur and we chose to walk the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> , he had came to look for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">He had heard that we were such a uh charming German family and uh we were uh, we would be hospitable he was sure, and uh so on and so forth, and he went on and on and on, and he's so happy that he finally met us. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And where is , so my mother told him that he had gone into to look for an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because it's you know, uh everybody had to evacuate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duratso</span> by December and uh or November or whatever the month was, and uh my father was not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Instead he was sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">This is a wooden <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , every move that you make you could hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Under my father's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was a suitcase filled with his prayer books, his , and he he just did not dare, really didn't dare move a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Uh he told us that his soldiers were combing the <span class="DLF">beach</span> for communists, for Partisans, and if my mother didn't care too much, wouldn't mind too much, he would like to make this his <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> for the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">This officer really and truly stayed the entire day with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">My mother kept brewing coffee and bring whatever refreshments she could think of, never went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Somehow this never realized that we didn't go to our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="928">My father sat on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , maybe six or eight hours that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And uh they took me for a walk down the <span class="DLF">beach</span> towards afternoon and uh wanted to take a picture with this . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I wore two long braids, wanted to take a picture of this very typical Germanic looking girl, and uh took a picture of me and also had to show off and threw a grenade into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and show ne how the fish were all dying and and foating up to the surface, and uh finally, finally at dusk, really departed from the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And promised that in a few days they would come and visit again and he was so interested in my father, that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Well, uh fortunately we had really found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in and together with uh three other Italian truck drivers who by now really were more or less uh without work because once the Germans took over they hardly used these Italian truck drivers anymore, and they were also by now enemies of the regime and they really didn't know what they were going to do or whether they were going to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> or would stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> or what they should be doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">At any rate, we were very good friends with one particular uh individual, uh was his name. , </span><span class="sentence" id="934">and uh two of his nephews I believe and together we took a uh <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of sorts in. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">My mother would cook and uh in exchange I think they paid far the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> uh, you know, for the rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And uh here now really the worst of our stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> started. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">The Germans were completely in uh control of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="938">As typical as always they uh uh put in, they never did their own dirty work. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">They always would create a local SS group of uh you know natives who would do their dirty work, as in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> they had the Iron Guard and in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> whatever they called them. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Here they called them the Ballistas (ph), a group of uh rough-necks really who decided to you know go on the <span class="REGION">German side</span> , Albanians uh who harrassed the Italians something awful, mostly for money. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And I remember that uh all of these uh friends of ours, these Italians, had uh uh you know, sold their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> by now because there was no more need for them, and what were they going to do for, with the with the money, and my mother was the chief uh monley uh <span class="DLF">belt sewer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">You know, they carried their money on the bodies in a belt kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Uh but these Ballistas would come in the middle of the night and search their uh <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="945">they didn't come to us . </span><span class="sentence" id="946">It became exceedingly exceedingly dangerous and exceedingly uh uncomfortable is uh is an understatement of the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">Uh these Ballistas, would come in the middle of the night always. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I mean this is this is their method, this is the way of doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">You always create much more terror and fear in people at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">Uh they would you know in in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , the <span class="DLF">doors</span> the the the uh <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were surrounded by high <span class="DLF">walls</span> and you have like a <span class="DLF">portal</span> , a big <span class="DLF">portal</span> that you close at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">But they would come and and bang against these these <span class="DLF">portals</span> you know, and you have to open them from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , and then they would proceed searching for money and for things and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">At any rate, uh by the winter of of uh of '43 or '44, by the winter of '44, all of these Italians who had evacuated by the Germans, on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , they drove them through the whole Balkan (ph) and into and back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Uh I started saying something to you before that this family , I visited last year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milano</span> after 46 years and got the tale end of the story because I never knew how he got to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And he told me the whole story uh how he was taken by the Germans and how they were treated, like new enemies. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">At any rate uh uh the these people who, with whom we were living were evacuated and so we also had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because it was too costly for us, and we moved to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I mean we were just moving around all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Summer of 1944, maybe June, July, whatever, uh notices went up on the uh on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> or on the tele...on the whatever, electric poles or whatever, uh all foreigners had to appear at <span class="BUILDING">SS headquarters</span> at such and such a date and register. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And this was the real thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Uh to come back to family , we still frequented their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from time to time, but it became so uh with the German officers walking in and out of there and somehow she was naive enough to not to understand that it to us was not only uh unpleasant but very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">It became a point you know, why aren't you in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> doing your duty and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">You know, my father wasn't all that old at that point yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">Uh we ceased going there. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">We simply did not go there anymore and uh uh now of course the big started. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">What are we going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Now some of us, by this time all, however mamy Jews were left, we were all together in , because this was the only <span class="NPIP">place</span> we could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">All the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> along the <span class="DLF">coast</span> had been mined by the Germans, and uh al... altogether 1t was much safer I guess to to to be in . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Uh Partisan activity at this stage of the game was extemely active. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Every night, the moment it got dark, they would come down from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , do all kinds of mostly attacking German positions attacking uh uh places of German concentration of soldiers, whatever - minimg <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , <span class="DLF">mining roads</span> and so on and shooting all night long. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">You would hear shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">There was always a curfew - the moment it got dark there was a curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">You could never be out at dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">Uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , in , there were <span class="BUILDING">market</span> days every Thursday. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">Every Thursday, Germans through their henchmen, would hang the number of Partisans that they had caught at night or who knows how many nights before, hang them from <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> uh tops and have the entire citizenry see them, and always on <span class="BUILDING">market</span> day, because that's when most people would come, go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and would see uh you know, the results of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And uh not knowing what was going on, my mother and I once uh were caught by uh you know - went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and spent and saw this and it was really horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">We never thereafter walked into the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Uh we were registered, and when it came to name and and address and where it was and how, religion, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> went over the left hand margin and they put down Jewish, so at this point we knew for sure that we had been registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And uh some of our people panicked and decided to uh escape to the Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">There were a few uh at least male members of the family that went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and uh escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Uh the uh they just did not want to take a chance and uh to stay on. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Uh we had a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">In fact, he was a cousin to this , and he had been a liaison officer between the Albanian government and the German officers, the German whatever uh general who was ruling over <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , and he knew exactly what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">He also knew of what we had heard that the Germans indeed had asked for the list of the Jews we don't know any Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">We only know Albanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And with that, the result of that was they naw had to proceed and register us themselves, and that of course caused a tremendous delay which was in our favor. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Well, this person had made arrangements with us that when the time came, and he hoped or he was sure that he would know when they would actually deport us, he would send a peasant to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and take us behind the uh <span class="DLF">Partisan lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="985">It was perhaps a tremendous chance to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">On the other hand I don't, we knew by this time that the conditions in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> were such that for a woman and a child to survive were almost nil. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">Uh food they didn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Uh health conditions of Partisans was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And uh we took the chance and stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And uh as I say, uh my parents had the number, I mean at this point they again had to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Uh my father started a bit in trading. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">He would buy wholesale and he would sell <span class="BUILDING">retail</span> and make a few pennies along the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">I was always left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and they always went together, and of course they met often these very tricky situations with Germans uh in the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> and not being able to talk and uh the store keeper knowing that they knew German and asking them to be interpreters uh of course never realizing the danger that they were putting them into because what did they - they didn't, they were not anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Uh Albanians certainly were not like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">And they didn't uh . </span><span class="sentence" id="996">Eventually the uh the activity of the Partisans became so tremendous that uh one night it was so terrible that I remember actually ending up under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="997">I mean the dangers were terrible uh at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">To leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">Uh between being caught by the Germans; or being caught by snipers from the Partisans or being uh somebody recognizing you - I mean I can't even tell you at this point how I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">I think it was really one great uh feelinlg of fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Fear that my parents wouldn't come back if they were a little bit delayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Uh just fear of everything really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1003">QUESTION: None
ANSWER:  Uh well, the uh one night the shooting at dawn didn't stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">That's quite simply what happened, and this was now the beginning of December 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">Uh we actually, it was so close to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we, I mean all night long we were just lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> taking shelter under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> or taking shelter under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I mean it was all really nonsense, but that's what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And as the rule was, that as soon as it got light <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the shooting would stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Well that day the shooting didn't stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And so we understood that something out of the ordinary had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And uh sure enough uh fairly uh soon - I don't know, maybe nine, ten o'clock in the morning - there was a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , on the <span class="DLF">portal</span> , and uh my father took all of his courage to his hand and opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">I'm sure he expected that German soldiers would be <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and were getting us finally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Uh two Partisan soldiers stood there in their green uniforme with the red star, communist star, on their hats. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And we understood that during the night they had occupied half of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of and we were the second <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in from the corner and across the <span class="DLF">street</span> were the Germans and on our side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> were the communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">Well, they told us that uh they would suggest that we leave <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because we were much too close to the <span class="DLF">line</span> and they didn't know what would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">We should quickly take a uh few belongings and go up the <span class="DLF">street</span> and there was a uh wellconstructed <span class="BUILDING">brick house</span> and with a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> and we should go there and stay there for a few days till .... Well, we did and uh we found other Albanians there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">Uh none of our own pleople lived in that uh <span class="REGION">area</span> at all, so were really on our own completely there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">Uh the only other people that we knew on the <span class="DLF">street</span> other than our landlord and land lady - and our landlord wasn,'t there because simply he had escaped into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">He was a loyalist and he knew what was happening, that the communists were taking over, so he had to escape because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Uh the only other family was a German family, no, a Swiss family, and they were Christian Scientists and they had lived for m,any years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Anyway, we spent the night there, and what they had done was literally organize in such a way that people slept in shifts, with just a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> and they let people sleep a few hours and then other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Suddenly in the middle of the night uh somebody shouted and screamed and we all went out to look what happened and half of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of was ablaze. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">The Germans in their retreat, and they hadn't retreated completely yet, had set the entire old <span class="BUILDING">market places</span> on fire and there was a tremendous . </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Uh the next morning my parents decided that uh there was one family by the name of who all along had lived uh way out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Way out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , quite near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , uh the beginning of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And uh so they decided to leave this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and to uh to go there with me, and we really made it in a few hours walking time we made it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Uh many times uh had to lie down or take shelter of some way or other because the shooting was going on, and uh we finally got there and of course they said that we could stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And they left me there and they took my, and my two parents, my parents decided they better go back and take a few belongings, and some clothes and some things, valuable things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Valuable things, whatever there was out of their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and then come back and stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Who knows how long the war will take. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">Well, they did make it back, and they may, and they did take some suitcase or two and put some belongings in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">And on the way back, indeed they were caught by cross-fire and uh my father shouted to my mother, in German, to take shelter, to lie down flat on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And a Partisan girl, soldier girl, heard them in German and of course thought that she had red-handed caught two German spies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">She marched them into the nearest uh <span class="BUILDING">station</span> of the uh <span class="BUILDING">Partisan police station</span> or whatever, and uh it was a very close call again, because as they walked in they took uh uh an Albanian out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">He was shot right outside this uh compound. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Uh God was good to them once again, and uh one of the uh officers inside this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , inside this <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> , recognized my parents from when we were interned in . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">He gave them the typical Albanian hug and kiss, and told one of the soldiers to accompany them to where we were staying and warned them not to leave until the end of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">That once he could help them, but who knows what would happen the second time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Well, this war between uh the Partisans and the German soldiers lasted for eighteen days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Uh they needed the <span class="DLF">route</span> , to keep an open <span class="DLF">route</span> to extract their soldiers, and they kept it open for eighteen days, and then one day we saw one single solitary <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British airplane</span> that bombed the <span class="DLF">escape route</span> for a few hours, and at the end of it all when it was really over, some of the Germans soldiers by this time had deserted, were 1n hiding - we saw them later on walking around in their tattered German uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">And uh and the Partisans were now in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">Practically speaking in December af 1944 we were liberated by the Albanian Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Uh the Germans had ruled with an iron hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">As I said before, they hung many uh Partisans that they caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">They also blew up <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and this is one sight that will never leave my image - I have actually seen whole <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> go up, <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> which they suspected that Partisans were either hiding 1n or belonged to families of Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">And they blew up the entire <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And I can never stop thinking of that, whenever I hear that in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> we blew a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of the PLO. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Now uh...
QUESTION:  (TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) Is there anything
ANSWER:  In a very very difficult way, because Albanian, the Partisans did not want us to and we were finally literally uh how shall I say, they, the Allies black-mailed the Albanians until the epidemic of the typhoid-cholera uh uh vacinnations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">People died very, like like flies, and un finally they used this vaccine by saying either you give us the few Jews who are here and we take them out, or you can't halve any more vaccine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">Now we were then taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in IItaly and this was our first encounter with the real true story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">We did not know, we knew there were - even when we feared to be deported we thought we were deported into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">We did not know the whole story as unrealistic as this may sound - we did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">We came into this uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> one evening and the next morning the only other young man started walking across uh these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> were along the <span class="DLF">coast line</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">Uh the province of
