<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  And to go over that, a-as we -- I left <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> , and f -- January first of 1948 -- "49, ’'m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">December ’47 -- January first, 1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">We arri -- we proceeded from <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> on a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span> that came from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> with permit to fish in <span class="REGION">Turkish waters</span> , which 1s the northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> , and by prearrangement with the help of the Greeks on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , th-the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> -- th-the fishers-man came close to the northern edge of <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> , with flashlights and signs and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">inflatable boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">They picked us up from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> where the Greeks brought us and put us on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span> named Karishe, and took us to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Over there the British were still controlling the <span class="DLF">Haifa port</span> , and we had to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to land, which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Netanya</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  How many people, roughly? </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I mean -- and how long did it take?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  It -- it was about 80 - 90 people, because the <span class="DLF">exits</span> or the escapes from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cyprus camps</span> were arranged of -- consisted of eight to 10 people per night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Once <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , the Greeks would pick us up and take us into an orange <span class="DLF">grove</span> by the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and lock us up there, so all day we could not come out, but at night they would come open the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and we roamed somehow, in the orange grove.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Hold on one second.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Okay, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fishing boat</span> dropped us off on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Netanya</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">They have -- two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> waited for us with food, clothes, blankets, whatever we could use, and took us 12 or 15 mile eastward, right across from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Netanya</span> , a pla -- a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baykleet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">That was a -- a place where -- of induction to the im -- Israeli army. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">As a former Cyprus senior officer in the Haganah, I was immediately put in charge of inducting a-all sorts of newcomers with my several languages that I spoke, Romanian, Hebrew, French and some German, I was able to make the proper arrangements for these youngsters and keep them there for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">The policy was that for -- to interview these youngsters and see what their future plans are, and send them to units where they could begin into that line of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I was kept there til March the 15" or eight -- 16", and as I ex-expressed my desire to study medicine, I was assigned to a <span class="BUILDING">military hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Was a formerly <span class="BUILDING">British hospital</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was called Tel HaShomer. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Tel Levinsky that became Tel HaShomer. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And that’s where I spent my next 30 month in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">At this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> I was supposed to be a -- every two month at a different, or a specialty wards, but I started at orthopedics, and s-so -- liked it so much that I stayed there all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Orthopedics and paraplegics. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And it was enough t-to come in contact with Israeli veterans or wounded soldiers, to become so convinced that -- of our righteous battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">All they wanted, these amputees and paraplegics, they wanted to get well so they can go back to the front and fight again. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Ah --
QUESTION:  And you would talk with them, and you would talk with them about these things, not just about their -- their injuries?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  Of course --
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  -- of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">That’s what kept them alive, the hope to get better, for a purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">The same time we had new immigrants from <span class="REGION">Arab countries</span> that -- that were so deprived of medical attention that some of them were absolutely paralyzed, or -- or -- they couldn’t function. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">One particular case I remember, a young kid that would walk only on four, knees and hands and he was brought to us from <span class="COUNTRY">Yemen</span> [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And, smart little kid, but he just couldn’t walk, and ma -- Dr. Goldman called me and had a little talk with me that if I agree and go along with him to do what he asks me to, I would -- we could make that child walk again. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And we talked to -- the first thing he said, the first problem I have is you have to sleep with him, in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And during the days we’ ll operate and at night he is all yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So within a short period of time we realized -- we obtained that we- we realized that, and the child started walking with crutches and [indecipherable] but ultimately he walked with one cane.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  Hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  That’s just one example. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Other examples were that many of the high officers in the military came to that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for injuries in the back and the knees. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I remember [indecipherable] Long was one of the patients, I guess, Dayan and some other big officers as well, as Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">What was his name, he was involved in the Warsaw ghetto uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Not [indecipherable] Levitz, but his deputy. [</span><span class="sentence" id="49">indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So, that’s where I spent three month in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , during which time my family started coming ba -- over from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> in 1949, My sister came, married, with her child. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">In 1950 my parents arrived and in 1951 my other sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">One brother stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> til 1959 and ha -- arrived later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Were you helping all of them, were you making it possible for them to come, or did they have some connections of their own?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They personally initiated and arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  And when you were working in this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for 30 months, that’s almost three years, did you intend to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> that whole time? </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Was it your intention to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and -- and try and make a life in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , or were you --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  That was your idea?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  In fact, 12 - 13 or 15 hours a day that I u-used to work brought me to exhaustion and the doctors would send me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> for 10 - 15 days of R and R. And those days I would visit the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , which was then at [indecipherable | a big <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> that was changed -- was given to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> for beginners and just visitor -- visiting students. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">That was part of the R and R in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , so that after two years of compulsory military in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , they asked me to stay longer, and I stayed another six months, to make it into 30 months service. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And that was the end of 1951 already, that I realized that the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> had no <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> or no beginning of <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">They had many students that started out abroad, and only with the third year they would start them in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , supervised by famous doctors and this way progress towards graduation. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But the first two years they couldn’t have, they needed dissections. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">The Orthodox Jews wouldn’t allow Jews to be dissected. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">That’s --
QUESTION:  And you needed those first years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  You had -- you hadn't had that yet.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Even though your family was coming over from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Yes, they all agreed that it’s rough, tough, and I’m still young to recoup, or recover. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So, late in 1951, I started the preparations or investigations into -- for going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Immediately I got me a English teacher, for more -- better English. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I started the passport applications and visas for the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">First they indicated I get the visa and get to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and there si -- approach the <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Then they informed me that no, it’s the other way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">First you have to be accepted by a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and on that basis we can grant you a visa for a student. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> my brother had a brother-in-law who was a professor at <span class="BUILDING">Wayne State University</span> , and he made all these arrangements on the basis of that high school diploma and obtained from them a letter that I am accepted for the semester beginning on September 12 or so, 1952. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But nothing was ready in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for me to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So I visited the <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> , undergo -- went a test in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">All arrangements began to s -- to -- to shape up to the point where I received a visa and we bought a ticket at TWA and started my trip on November the second of 1952.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Before you went, your parents had already come?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  1950 they arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  They had already come, and your -- had brothers and sisters there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Was it a -- difficult for you to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Was it a wrenching, emotionally, to leave? </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I mean --
ANSWER:  It had to be, but they themselves were in bad shapes, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">All they could afford or find were very limiting -- limited housing conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">The first sister that came in °49 had a <span class="INT_SPACE">one room apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">It’s the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with -- 1950 my parents arrived -- had to stay with them for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Then the parent moved out and the other sister arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">When her husband realized what’s going on, he took off into the <span class="DLF">desert</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">B’eyr-Sheva</span> , and there he found all they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">A lot of work - he was in the building area, the <span class="BUILDING">building business</span> , and he build up th-the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Negev</span> , the <span class="DLF">desert</span> , all the way to the Dead Sea, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzim</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So slowly, slowly things settled in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but my going was part of their settlement and after leaving the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and [indecipherable] to take off for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I was unemployed -- oh, no, I worked for the [indecipherable] right in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaffa</span> , where my parents lived.</span></p>
