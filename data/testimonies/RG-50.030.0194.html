And one day I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And what the Gypsies did, they kept the children and they would sell them--literally, sell children. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Well, I was missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And my parents were going absolutely crazy looking for me; but my father knew exactly where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And he went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gypsy camp</span> , and I was there and he took me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I remember that very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And there, the men and women were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I was with my grandparents and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">The young men were in a different...uh <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> were <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and everything; and we had to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> for a bowl of soup and a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I don't remember too much more about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Uh, I do remember people talking always about what lay ahead and what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And uh...then one day...uh my father approached me. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And my parents...and they told me that...I remember my father saying to me that he doesn't know what lays ahead and what will become of us, but he would like me to go with some nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And it turned out to be the French Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And uh...I also think that a lot of people were against my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It was like giving their child away. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">But they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They thought that was best for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Uh, they thought that if they could save me or do whatever, they would do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So uh they took us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">The last... don't remember saying good bye to my father; but I do have a picture of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I...the last ttme I saw my mother was behind <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I was on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , she was on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And we said goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And that's] the last I heard or seen of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">That was my last picture of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And many years later, I found out that a few days after I left with by ten other children to get to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> that all that transport went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The reason that my father did not get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is that he was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And halfway to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ... He told me that later, since he survived, too--that half way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , they stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they asked...all the young men had to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And women and children and old men had to stay in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So my father had to leave my parents... leave my mother and grandparents, and leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And he said...then he saw a big sign to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and he saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And that's the last he seen or heard of his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And uh...then uh...he was 1n several <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , which he told me after, which I don't remember the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Uh, I was taken with the other children to a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And we were there for a short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Not very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I remember bombs falling, and the sirens always, and running into shelter. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And I can remember we would be running to the <span class="DLF">shelter</span> on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> falling on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> with bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And the <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> was hit and was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And so we had to be separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And the best thing was to take us to a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> in southern...

One day, she sent me away to get something. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I don't even remember what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I was out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and the Gestapo came. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">She said 4, 5 Gestapo with the guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">One was guarding the outside of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And they went through the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> to <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , they have the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> outside--you know, the <span class="INT_SPACE">stone cellars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They...I mean, they checked. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">They even slashed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I mean, they went through that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a fine tooth comb. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And she kept saying, "I don't have a Jewish child here, and I don't.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">They didn't find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to the disaster of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And uh never...she never told me what happened; and it was because of...of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And uh...but time went by the same, you know, the everyday routine. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Again, for some reason, I wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">She sent me to get something. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Gestapo came a second time. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">The same thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They didn't find me, and they never came again. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">It was the last time that they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And time went by. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">It was already wintertime--must have been in...near '40...1944, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And one day after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , Madame Didier was sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> with a lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And I walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And she said that this lady came to pick me up and take me away to a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I could not stay there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Well, I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I was very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">This was my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I didn't know any...anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And the lady sat down, and she told me that I was not a Catholic child. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I was a Jewish child, and I had to go back with...with my people. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Etienne</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> that was run by a Polish rabbi and his staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And he was gathering Jewish children from all over <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , wherever they could find us; and bring us together again under...under one <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So I had no warning or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And I just packed my little suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I really didn't have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And I had to say goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And [...[...I'll never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">It was on a Friday, on a Friday afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And I left with the lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I think what actually saved my life through all this was I was a very passive child. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I never asked any questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I might have cried or been unhappy, but never [said], "Why is this happening?," </span><span class="sentence" id="273">or "Why that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I think now, in later years, maybe that saved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Because I just did whatever told to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I was told to be Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I was told to learn French. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And I did whatever I was told to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So being that it was a Friday afternoon, we arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> ...

"</span><span class="sentence" id="304">You cannot talk 'til you say a prayer, 'til you eat a piece of bread.” </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So...she said, "Whatever I say, you repeat after me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So she said the prayer over the bread, and I repeated. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">No questions asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I repeated it. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And then we ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And uh...we had to pray after dinner, and we prayed before we went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Uh, wasn't much different as praying when I was Catholic; and it was Hebrew, and I settled in just like I did everywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And I became, in fact, very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Now, that was my whole life. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I knew every prayer by heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I...when we went Saturday to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , before long I didn't need the book anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I am ashamed to say I forget everything now. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But then, I became very, very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And uh...we talked...I talked to the rabbi, and I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And he said that...he told me that when the war is ever over and everything 1s alright, and if no one [in] my family claims me and comes back, I could go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And uh...so uh...you know, time passed and went on like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Uh, war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I remember, because everybody was singing and...and dancing on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">In 1945, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I was about 10 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And uh...we knew that the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And uh...so I thought, "Oh, I'm going to get ready to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I had already talked with the rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And uh ...he said that he would put things in motion, and when people could travel to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> I would be one of the first to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And then one day, I was called into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And I was told that they had a letter from my father; that he had survived, and that he lives now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And that when he was liberated by the Russians in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , he was looking for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And he contacted the French Red Cross, because that's the last he remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">He remembered me...giving me up to the French Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So he thought he'd get in touch with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">He didn't know whether I was alive or dead, or what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So they traced me, obviously; and they found me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint-Etienne</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And there was a big letter in German written from my father, and they translated it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And he just said that he was looking for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Nothing was ever mentioned in the letters about my mother and my grandparents not surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Uh, I became...I asked ...

<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Well, uh I don't remember too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Uh, because we were mostly in the <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">It was a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , with big <span class="DLF">grounds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And uh...everyone that uh...that worked there was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And uh...in fact, uh it comes to mind now we did everything ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Uh, for Passover, we made our own matzah. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So we made our matzah. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">We bake our challah for Friday night. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And uh...we pretty much stayed within the confines of the...the <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">We did go sometimes into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">It wasn't far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And I know I've been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ; but I really don't recall much about it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I...I think I would get much more if I could go now. (</span><span class="sentence" id="392">Laughter) But uh...we would go there, and also I remember uh...being uh...we were so religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Uh, we would do everything before the Sabbath would start. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We would uh...cut toilet paper, uh that Friday morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Uh, we would uh put the lights on, and uh...we would...

<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  How we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Uh, my father had a brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">They came here in 1938, with his wife and two children and my grandmother Lang--my father's mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And he sponsored us. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">We needed to be spons...sponsored, affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">He sent the affidavit, and that's how we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">But we didn't come 'til 1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">So uh...but uh...my sister Ruth came a year ahead of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">She didn't...she didn't want anything to do with...with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">She just wanted to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And we just... My parents were not quick enough for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">She just wanted to get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And so she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> a year before we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And uh...then, by the time, we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , she had already had a job and she...she had some family here, too, on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I think, on her father's side, they had cousins that lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I don't remember it very uh....too well, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And uh...I was always kept a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">That's one thing I think my parents made a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">They were very, very strict, uh more so with me than with the older girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And uh...they felt that I had no parents from the time I was 6; and they looked at me like I was 6, not 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And those 6 years never gapped together. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I think they never recaptured those 6 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">They always kept their child. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I was only to be seen and not heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">My opinion didn't count. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I was never asked anything; just, you know, told. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And, in fact, that brings to mind... I want to go back on something. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">When I first came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , my parents were not Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">They were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">They went <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on holidays, but they were not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">They did not keep a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I was lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I didn't want to eat; and then if I did eat something, it had to be out of glass dish or glass bowl. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Because that's considered neutral. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And I was just told blankly, "You do as we do, or you don't.” </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I mean, that's how it was.

I had to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I wasn't allowed to hang around with my...with my with friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And it followed through. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And I tell you, if not for Margot and Ruth, I don't know what would happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Because they were always on my side. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Always stood up for me, always uh interferred, tried to help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">It was hard, because they were 5 and 6 years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">When I was 12, they were 17 and 18, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And uh...they were already working or going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ; and Ruth came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So it was...I found it to be very hard to...to live with my father and new-found, you know, mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And uh...the word "stepmother" and "stepdaughter" or "stepsister," "stepchildren" was not allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">It was a word that was not allowed in our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">My mother always said, "We have three girls, three daughters; and they are all ours.” </span><span class="sentence" id="645">People would stop my parents on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and they would say, "Now, whose girls are yours? </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And who are Paula's, and who are Fritz's children?" </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And my mother would say, "We have three daughters.” </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And I don't doubt that she loved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I am sure she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And she always said everything she did for me was for my own good. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And I always thought so, and I still think--not always--that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">But that's how they felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">You know, they...they felt very stongly. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And once, I misbehaved very badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And I talked back to my mother; and I said, "If my mother were alive, I would not have said that.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I don't even remember what I said or did. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And my father was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> when I said that. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">That was the only time, first and only time, he ever slapped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">He slapped me across the face so hard that I fell across the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Literally, fell across the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And then I never ever brought up my mother again from that time on. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And uh...I never said anything, you know, anymore; but I did do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">But I was a child, you know, and I was...by then... When they married, I was 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And uh...a young 13, very young 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And uh... So then we... Oh, and then in the meantime, my youngest sister, Margot, was seeing a young man--a soldier, American soldier--who uh... In fact, he originally was born in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> [Pol: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oswi_cim</span> ] in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> when he was a young child, and came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> way before the war when he was 8 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And he was at the tail end of the Second World War, and Margot... They met each other, and they fell in love. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And when when his term of duty was up, he went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And they wrote to each other later, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And he was like my big brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">He was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Uh, he took us for ice cream to the American P.X., you know; and that's where I got first candy bar, first movie, ice cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">He used to bring jars of ice cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">My father loved [the] ice cream he would bring. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was always full of young men--soldiers that my sister knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And there was a lot of people, young people, there. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">But I always felt...1 was always singled out to where I didn't quite belong, because I was so much younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And everything was always kept from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I don't have to know this, and I don't have to know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And they just tried to keep me little. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">They didn't let me grow up. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And, unfortunately, that continued through my...through my life, you know.</span></p>
