<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  The date is August 6, 1992 and we’re speaking with Dr. Marsha Rozenblit in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silver Spring</span> , <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Dr. Rozenblit is going to tell us about her father and his family, and any family members that she can recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">So please, could you tell me your father’s name, his date of birth and then anything you can about his childhood and his family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Okay, my father whose name was Mendel Rozenblit was born on November 13, 1907 in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Anyway this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was in the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , I don’t know exactly in which direction or ...... Okay, so my father was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> which was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> in 1907. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">He was born into a pretty religious family. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I think that parts of the family were associated with the Hasidim. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">But he did not grow up technically as a Hasidic child. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">He was just an ordinary traditionally religious Polish Jewish boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">His father died when he was very young, well not very young I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Well let me go backwards a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My father was one of about six or seven children and he was in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">He was not the oldest or the youngest; he was one of the middle children. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">His father died when he was a young boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I think, if my memory serves me correctly, he was about twelve when his father died, which means his father died just after World War I of asthma. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">But I think he was sickly for most of his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">But my grandmother, that is my father’s mother whose name was --well I should say that my father’s father’s name was Avraham Rozenblit -- and his mother Masha Markusfeld Rozenblit, after whom I’m named Marsha -- Masha, his mother managed quite well to have six children and run the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">She owned a, well my mother used to say she owned a <span class="BUILDING">general store</span> , but my cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> who was seventeen when he left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and really knew her, said that she basically owned a <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">That is, she sold other things too, but it was mostly shoes and what she would do is, she would take trips to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> and see what was in the fancy <span class="BUILDING">shoe stores</span> there and then copy them and arranged to have the shoes made. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">She didn’t make them herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">She wasn’t a shoemaker but she would get them made and then sell them, both in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and also in a kind of...She would send her children out to sell them also, when they were grown, to sell them to the peasants in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">That I learned from my cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">But let me just try to say something about my father’s family background in general before I talk more specifically. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">They were a very religious family and pictures of my father show him wearing the sort of traditional cap of the Polish Jews, you know that sort of squarish cap. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I can’t tell from the pictures whether he has pais or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">It’s hard to tell, but maybe he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I should say before I go on that my father died, Mendel Rozenblit, the survivor that we’re talking about, died in 1961 when I was ten years old so that most of my recollections come from either things I actually remember him saying, or things that my mother told me that he had said, or things that my cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , that is his nephew, Mordecai Rozenblit, who came to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 1938 has told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So it’s a sort of conglomerate of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So, in any case it was a traditional religious family in the <span class="REGION">Lublin area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">His mother owned this <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I don’t think she was rich but she was reasonably prosperous and my father had all of these brothers and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">His oldest, I don’t even know the age order, I think Nehama the sister, he had one sister and five brothers I believe, and the sister, Nehama, was I think the oldest and then there were other brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">There was Simcha, there was Haim Yakov, there was Meir who was the baby, there was Yehoshua and I know how most of them died actually and I’ll get back to that later when we talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">But Haim Yakov was a very ardent Zionist and he left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 1937 and then his son Mordecai joined him in 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Were the rest of the family involved in Zionism, do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  You know, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">My cousin, Mutti, Mordecai, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> has many times told me that you know, he had said to me, [Marsha, at yahdat ha abba shelach lo haya Zioni] which means Marsha, your father wasn’t a Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But I think that’s not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I think that Mutti means by that, that my father didn’t move to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And Mutti 1s still mad at him forty years later for not having done that. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I do have his Zionist membership card from after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">But, of course, everybody was a Zionist after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So the question is was he an active Zionist before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Judging from the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> he sent his children to I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">That is an active Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I don’t think he was active in the Zionist movement, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But he was probably sympathetic to Zionism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  I was going to ask you about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Have you researched or found out anything about that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , was it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> or.....?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  Well, all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> are shtetls, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> just means little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  What was the nature of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I don’t know how big it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">It certainly wasn’t a large <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> was in <span class="REGION">central Poland</span> so it was <span class="REGION">central Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I think my image of it as a child was that it was like any small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">American town</span> with white <span class="DLF">picket fences</span> and neat little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on neat little <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And I was shocked in 1972 or ’03, I was talking to Lucin Dovarshitsky who teaches Polish- American history at YIBO and who is a member of whatever the staff at the <span class="BUILDING">YIBO Institute</span> and Lucin Dovarshitsky at the time was busy collecting lots and lots and lots of pictures for the Image Before My Eyes volume and I said my father was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> and he said well I’ve got a picture of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> , come and see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So I went upstairs to his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and I looked at this picture of Lukow and it was not my image. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I mean it was a muddy little <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">This was a picture taken in 1926 and it was this dreary little muddy <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So it was a tiny little nothing of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Although my cousin Mutti in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> who was seventeen when he left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> has nice memories of it so 1t couldn’t have been that horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I mean maybe this picture doesn’t do it justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">He has nice memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">My father left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> when he married and lived near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Ill get to that in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">So his adult life was not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> , it was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw suburb</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">The stories of his childhood that he told me when I was little were certainly not negative. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">If his family was prosperous, even if they weren’t rich they wouldn’t have suffered much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Do you know much about his education, where he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  He went to <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">He was born in 1907. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">He was born when that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was part of the Russian Empire. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I know he just went to traditional <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">He did not have a formal secular education as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I do know that he could read Polish easily and that means that he must have had some secular education. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">All the schooling he ever spoke of was cheder. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">On the other hand since he could read Polish novels he must have also gone to something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">He didn’t have a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> education, that I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">He didn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">But he must have gone to some <span class="BUILDING">Polish school</span> as well as <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> because you can’t read Polish easily if you hadn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Speaking it is one thing but knowing it 1s another. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So I think that he and virtually all his siblings just went to <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> and maybe also some kind of <span class="BUILDING">Polish elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">There is one thing that 1s important and that is his younger brother, Meir, wanted very much to have a real secular education and he did go to <span class="BUILDING">Polish school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> in their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , or maybe not in their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it’s hard to say since I was only ten when my father died, he may have just said <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and maybe Meir went off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> to go to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">In any case my grandmother who was a religious woman, who wore a sheitel and so forth, nevertheless was willing to let her youngest son go to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">This must have been already, since Meir is younger than my father, this must have been after World War 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">It must have been in the twenties. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was very mad at her for doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So she was something of a progressive because she was, although very religious, was willing to let her son go to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , and of course going to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> meant going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And theoretically Jews were exempt from writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And in fact, they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But obviously it spoke of abandoning traditional Jewish life and entering the larger world. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">She was certainly willing to do this and was willing to defy the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to let this happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I remember my father telling a story about how there was a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , like a <span class="BUILDING">secular library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Now maybe it was a <span class="BUILDING">Zionist library</span> , may it was Pol.....[ don’t know what and a lit of the “frumies’’, a lot of the very religious people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> marched against it and they tried to burn it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And my grandmother, who was herself religious and not secular, nevertheless sort of defied them and insisted that her son Meir go to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Actually Meir had a very different experience from all the rest of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Meir not only went to <span class="BUILDING">Polish gymnasium</span> but after he graduated from <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , and this must have been into the ‘30’s at some point, he went to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> to study to be a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">He didn’t go in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because it was very difficult for Jews to do that in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He went first in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">He was presumably deported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because he was dead too. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So his experience was different from everybody else’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">One brother went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> where he died a natural death in 1943 of a heart attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Haim Yakov is the one who went to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and Meir was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Do you have pictures of either of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  I have pictures of Meir as a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">No, actually as an adult, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Come to think of it, yes, there is a picture of Meir as an adult, two pictures of Meir as adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">One from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and one I’m not sure where from. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">He went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pisa</span> and studied medicine and then he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I think he married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> but I don’t think he had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And I don’t know what happened to his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I don’t know if she was deported or not deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">My father never tried to look her up after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And my mother, after my father’s death, was suspicious that perhaps Meir’s wife wasn’t Jewish and that’s why my father hadn’t bothered to look her up after the war because he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> for two and a half years after the war, he could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And he knew his brother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And he found out that his brother had been deported so he could have presumably investigated his brother’s wife but he didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">That may mean that the family was angry that he had married a non-Jewish woman or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Anyway Meir’s experience as an educated Jew, as an educated person and the fact that Haim Yakov was a devout Zionist, I think indicates that this family, while very religious, clearly had its arms out to the modern world, either through Jewish nationalism or through secular education. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And it’s also true that my father, although raised as a very religious little boy, as an adult was not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">As an adult in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I don’t mean in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> after the war, that’s something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But as an adult in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was not as religious as he had been growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">He had a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> , he sent his kids to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> , he was very Jewish, but that was normal in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">People did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But he was not that observant a Jew as an adult in the thirties as he had been growing up although his mother remained religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I assume some of his siblings were and some weren’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">That would be a nice question to ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">My cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> would know all these answers because he was seventeen when he left and he would have a better sense of who was religious and who was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Anyway what else can I say about just his family background. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">His mother had this <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I think several of his brothers were involved in running the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> or in, as I said, selling to the peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But some of the brothers moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">He himself moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I think another brother, Simcha moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I’m not sure where his sister Nehama lived when she grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I mean they were all adults by the °‘30’s and they were all married and had children and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">The only thing I could say I suppose my grandmother, Masha Markusfeld Rozenblit, I mean ‘Markusfeld” is very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">She was a Markusfeld. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Rozenblit was something that accrued to her but she was a Markusfeld. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">She must have been a very feisty lady, she sounds like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">She ran this <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , she had her six kids ‘which she raised by herself, or at least partly. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We have a picture of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">She looks like a Jewish woman from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> but she was kind of a neat lady, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Do you know when she was born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  No, but she was in her sixties when she was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So that would make her born in the 1880’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Right and if my father was born in 1907 that’s about right. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So she would have been born in the 1880’s or 1870’s, probably in the 1870’s if he was born in 1907 and he was not her first child, he was her third or fourth child. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And I think my father’s father, Avraham Rozenblit, he was probably in his forties when he died, in around 1919 say so that means he was born also in the 1870’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">My father, by the way, even though he did not have formal higher education or even secondary education, knew a lot of languages like many Jews of that part of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Yiddish was of course his native language like it was for virtually all the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> except a small group of hyper-assimilated Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But he was fluent in Polish and that was common for his generation, that is people who came of age in the twenties and thirties knew increasingly also, unless they were just Hasidim, increasingly really knew Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And certainly my cousin Mutti, the one who moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 1937, ’38, Mutti went to <span class="BUILDING">Polish public school</span> in the thirties and has very fond memories of his teachers in the <span class="BUILDING">Polish elementary school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> , that they were not anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I don’t know if he’s telling the whole truth when he says that, it may be nostalgia. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I mean he has unkind words about Poles in general but his teachers were very loving and very nice and he has very fond memories of going to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> in Polish although how deep his Polish language knowledge is, is hard to say, because at this point in the 1990’s after living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for fifty odd years he really can speak only Hebrew and Yiddish and English which he learned tn the British army during World War II but his Polish, I think, is so rusty that he didn’t use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But anyway my father knew Yiddish of course which was his mother tongue, Polish which he spoke totally fluently. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">He knew Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Now that’s unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">That would indicate also a Zionist whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">My mother says he knew Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Now what does that mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">She says, she insisted that he spoke modern Israeli Hebrew, that he could easily speak Hebrew to an Israeli. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I don’t remember that although we did have an Israeli neighbor in the fifties and my mother says he spoke to her in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Now maybe he said three words and my mother thought that meant he...... Certainly he had a traditional cheder education and he was well versed. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">He wasn’t a Talmudist but he knew Hebrew in the way a traditionally educated Jew knew Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">It wasn’t rote. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">He could look at the prayer book or at a bible and understand what it said. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">He knew Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I don’t know if he could read or write Russian but he certainly could speak Russian and he knew German. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">So he knew his languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Okay what else can I say about just childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">My father was clearly a very mischievous little boy because there are several stories that I remember of him directly telling me for example about how they tormented the Malamed at <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> , how they tormented the teacher at the traditional Jewish school in the <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">In fact I remember when I was in <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> as a child he would say to me, Marsha you must never do the things to your teacher that we did, that I did to our teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And he did all the things you read about in all the <span class="BUILDING">Haskala</span> , I mean putting tacks on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and putting honey on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and they just bedeviled the life of the poor teacher, which was standard, standard childhood high-jinx. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And the other thing 1s that his sister Nehama who was older than he, probably three or four years older even though she was three children older, his sister Nehama wanted a date. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">World War I was a kind of liberating experience, not the war itself, that was just a horrible experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">In the aftermath of the war things really opened up and social life really changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And she wanted to go out on dates but her mother didn’t want her to because her mother was still very traditional. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And so my father and another one of his brothers would conspire with her to sneak her out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And they did this through some kind of <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> , some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armoire</span> , in Europe they have these <span class="INT_SPACE">closets</span> and apparently they would move it against the <span class="DLF">window</span> and open the <span class="DLF">window</span> and open the back of the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I don’t remember the exact details but I have vivid memories of riding in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">family car</span> in the 1950’s with my father telling me stories about how they would trick his mother so that Nehama could go out on a date with probably the man she ended up marrying. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But, you know, nothing serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">She didn’t cover her hair, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Pictures we have of her or that I’ve seen of her as an adult, she didn’t cover her hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So clearly this was a very mischievous child. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">He always had a twinkle in his eyes as an adult, too, so he clearly was the kind.....and survivors, of course, were often the kind of people who were mischievous sorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Okay, I think I don’t know very much more about my father’s real childhood, that is when he was a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">If I think of anything I'll come back to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">My father got married pretty young. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">He got married when he was about twenty or twenty-one to a cousin of his whom he loved very deeply. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So this was also non-traditional in a way, that is it was a love marriage, not an arranged one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  Was it a first cousin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  You know I think it was a first cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I think it was his first cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I’m not a hundred per cent positive that she was his first cousin but she was definitely his cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Her father owned a <span class="DLF">lumber yard</span> in the <span class="REGION">Warsaw area</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span> , which I think is spelled W OL OMIN,Imnota hundred per cent sure but I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">It’s in the <span class="REGION">Warsaw area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So he moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , or to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span> , and he ran his father-in-law’s business or worked with his father-in-law in running the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">His wife though, whose name was either Mira or Perella I don’t remember which, his wife though died about a week after their first child was born because she had a rheumatic heart and she was warned by doctors not to have any children and she then didn’t listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">She wanted a child, it wasn’t accidental. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They weren’t that religious and she died very shortly after he was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  So you think she was probably about twenty years old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  She was probably twenty, twenty-one. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I think my father was twenty-one and she was probably the same age or a year younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">She was very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Their son’s name was Avraham. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">He was named after my father’s father. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Avraham was born therefore, let’s see in 1943 when he was killed, he was twelve. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So he was born in 1931. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">So my father wasn’t twenty-one, he was twenty-four. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Well, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">These stories have gotten passed from my mother who was not especially good at dates but I think Avraham was born either in 1930 or 1931. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And his wife died and he was very, very miserable, naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And the family talked him into marrying her sister whose name was either Mira or Perella. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">In other words, Mira and Perella were his wives. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I just don’t remember which was the first and which was the second. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I think Perella was the second. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I think Mira was the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Again I’m really not a hundred percent sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Again my cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> would know the answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And they had another child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  The family talked him into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Was this under duress then that he did this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  No, I think they talked him into it in the sense that this is the smartest and best thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">The child needs a mother, what better mother than her sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">She needs a husband, she’s a nice lady, why don’t you just marry her. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">You know I think it was that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And he was very depressed and he needed a mother for his child and maybe she was already taking care of the kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I don’t know exactly but he definitely married her. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And it was all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Obviously it was sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I didn’t know this when I was a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">When I was a child my father was very open and talked a huge amount about his Holocaust experience and about his life before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">But for whatever reason, maybe because it was ordinary tragedy rather than the special Jewish tragedy of the Holocaust, he didn’t tell me about the fact that his first wife had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">He thought that would be too sad for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Here he was telling me about his son and daughter who had been slaughtered by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And that he could tell me about. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But the specific tragedy of his own personal life with his wife’s death he didn’t tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I found out when I was twenty or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">A cousin of his in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was visiting us and she just mentioned it casually. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I said, what are you talking about? </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And she told me the whole story and I just bawled. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">It was very sad that this love of his life died in childbirth. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">But anyway he did have a daughter with the second wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Her name was Toby. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">That’s what my mother called her. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">It’s probably Tova, which again sounds both modern and Hebraic, Gittel is the Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Tova is already a sign of modernity in its modern Jewish form. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">She was four years younger than Avraham. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So she would have been born in 1934 or ’35, something like that, or °33 depending on exactly when Avraham was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And my father continued to live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span> with his wife and running this lumberyard. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">He sent his kids to -- there were several Jewish school systems in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">There was the Zionist school system and the Bundist school system and the “frumie’’, the religious school system and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">He sent his children to a school system that was very like American Jewish Day schools, that is Jewish subjects which were taught in Hebrew and secular subjects were taught in Polish which was not the case in the Zionist or <span class="BUILDING">Bundist schools</span> where everything was taught either in Hebrew or Yiddish with only a minimal amount of Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">So his children went to this kind of modern Jewish school which means, of course, that it was a little bit more religious than both the Zionist or the <span class="BUILDING">Bundist schools</span> which would indicate a kind of moderate religious position. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So that’s the kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> he sent his kids to. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">As I said he kept a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I don’t think he was Sabbath observing. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So he was kind of a little traditional, but not....
QUESTION:  And they spoke Yiddish at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I assume.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  You know I don’t know what language. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Certainly growing up he spoke Yiddish at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , that goes without saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">What language did he speak as an adult in his family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I really don’t know if he spoke Yiddish or Polish or both. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">You know if you’ re utterly fluent it probably depends on your mood. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Yiddish was definitely his mother tongue, what he dreamed in, what he counted in was definitely Yiddish, but I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I bet they spoke Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I think most Jews spoke Yiddish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  That would be my guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  My guess would be Yiddish although maybe sometimes Polish depending if the kids came back from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and spoke Polish, then you answered them in Polish and then all of a sudden for an hour you were talking Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">But then if you stopped talking for a minute and then started talking again you probably would speak Yiddish because Yiddish was the natural thing to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">After the war in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> my father was utterly fluent in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">He learned English very quickly and spoke English with my mother who was American born. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">But with his friends from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> who had survived the war, and some of them had as partisans and so on, these friends who were in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , their natural language that they spoke was Yiddish although all of them were modern. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">None of them were orthodox and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">The natural language they would speak was Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">But sometimes they would just speak Polish and it would drive my mother crazy because as an American Jew she did know Yiddish but she didn’t know Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And she would get very angry with them when they spoke Polish and the angrier she got the more they would speak Polish to make her angrier because they were very jealous of her because she had parents because she was American and they didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">The thing they had on her was that they could speak more languages and so they would speak Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">But my guess is that Yiddish would be the language of his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I don’t know what kind of <span class="BUILDING">home</span> he lived in. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">He was certainly reasonably prosperous, certainly middle class and definitely in contact with his family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">He still had brothers and I think his sister was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">His mother certainly was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Of course he had aunts and uncles and cousins and nieces and nephews. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">All of his brothers and sisters had married. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">They all had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">He was the closest with his sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">The sibling he talked the very most about was his sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">They were named for the same person. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Mendel is a Yiddish nickname for Menachem and so technically his name was Menachem Mendel Tzidik. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I should tell you my father’s formal name was Menachem Mendel Tzidik Rosenblit which would translate -- Tzidik 1s Tzadok. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Just a Jewish way of saying Tzadok and Nehama, his sister, who was called Nechuma, ?? </span><span class="sentence" id="296">raised eyes that she was called Nechuma. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Nechuma was obviously named for the same person. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">She was born first and they named her Nehama to be after whatever relative, Menachem. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So when my father was born they named him after the same relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So he was very close with his sister and he talked about Meir because Meir was unusual because he was the one who had the secular education and had gone off to study medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">That was all he talked about with any specificity except in terms of how each of them died in the Holocaust and I can tell you about that when we talk about the war years. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I don’t know what his wife did. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I don’t know if his wife worked or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Probably not given the 1930’s in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and middle class family. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I doubt that she worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They were definitely middle class. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">This is not somebody making -- with nostalgia, hindsight, looking back because well maybe this isn’t a good historical -- forget this. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I was going to say I’ve seen the list of property that he presented to the United Restitution Organization as part of his reparation claim. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">It’s the kind of things middle class people have, you know silver and whatever, fur coats and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But you know people could lie on those so that’s not necessary a good source. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I think that despite the very terrible situation for Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in the 1930’s, you know very high anti-Semitism and very terrible economy and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">That my father did reasonably well. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">He certainly didn’t give any thought as far as I know to migrating, although, there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to migrate to except for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And he wasn’t enough of a Zionist to want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> although his brother Haim Yakov did. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">They had relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> like probably every Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> but <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was out of the question by the twenties so I think he was perfectly content to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">In terms of his attitude to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , actually when he was born, he was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and of course the Polish Jews hated <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> because they were discriminated against so severely, I think he thought of himself as a Polish national. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I think he was a typical Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in the sense that his primary identity was as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">If you asked him, who are you, what are you, he would say Iam a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">But he was Polish, he spoke Polish, he identified with the Polish state. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">He thought of himself as a Polish subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">He used that word actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">He called himself a Polish subject which is a funny archaic word which is usually used for kingdoms. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But that’s how Jews were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">They were members of the Polish state but they weren’t Poles so he would never have said that he was a Pole because he wasn’t a Pole, he was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I suppose he was hoping that the <span class="REGION">Polish Republic</span> would get to be a nicer <span class="NPIP">place</span> than it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">As I said I was ten when he died and at ten I didn’t ask him such nice interesting political questions as what you thought about <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and how you related to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">What else could I tell you about right before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">QUESTION:  This is good. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">This is all good and it’s what we need.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  That’s what you need. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So basically before the war, on the eve of the war, in 1939, on September 1, 1939, my father had a business that was reasonably prosperous. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">He lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">He had a wife; he had two children, a boy and a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">He had a huge extended family. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">He had a very large family, he had a mother and sisters and brothers, nieces and nephews, aunts and uncles, cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">He had a large and intact and functioning family. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And then the war started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  So what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  What happened, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">You know I’m used to telling the story to my six -year old son and of course to my six- year old son I have to include what happened during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I have to sketch out the war and what the Nazis did to the Jews and I don’t have to do that here. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">In the first months of the war there was just chaos and all kinds of restrictions against the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I assume that his business was Aryanized because that’s what the Germans did as soon as they came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">They Aryanized businesses giving them to ethnic Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I assume my father was not compensated for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">He was a clever man. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">He probably managed to get stuff out of it before it was technically Aryanized. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">In all the stories he talked about the years before he was deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> he never mentioned that he was starving to death and he was living on the <span class="DLF">street</span> or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Of course he was starving but he wasn’t......He must have managed to get something out of his business even though he wasn’t compensated for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">You read about this in the memoirs people who with Polish friends manage to make arrangements and deals and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">But anyway his business was confiscated, his bank accounts frozen, all of those things taken from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">But then, of course, he was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Now when my father was alive and he talked about his experiences in the war he always simply said the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">He didn’t specify which one. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">When my mother, who is not a historian and who is not at all good with details and in fact was terrible with details, when my mother talked about it for him, after he died, or when I would ask her as I got a little older, well which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , she said the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , that he was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Some of the details of his story very much match the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> in terms of.....well the fact 1s he escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> when it was burning in April 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">That’s the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">What other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was burning in April ’43 that you could escape from in some way. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">But on the other hand, he didn’t live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">He lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span> which was close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">There could have been a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">On the other hand it was so close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> that all the people may have been moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">But usually people who had to move into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> did very, very badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And my father obviously didn’t fare badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I think that he probably was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">He probably did just simply get moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Let’s say for the purposes of this record that he was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">QUESTION:  Have you looked up any of the records about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span> if they did transfer them at some point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  No, I have never done that. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">It’s funny, I’m a historian and not a genealogist and so ’'m interested in what happened to the Jews and I’ve never bothered to look up the specifics of my father’s experience in any systematic way. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">A lot of his experiences that he described are very, very similar to what you read in the memoirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So it fits in very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">But I never tried to.....when I was reading Itzhak Arrad’s book about ???? </span><span class="sentence" id="374"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> which is about the operation ??? </span><span class="sentence" id="375"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> which basically gassed all the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and certainly the <span class="REGION">region</span> he was living in because the section of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that both he and his family was in was the general government. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">The Germans came in and annexed the Bartoland and created the general government and the Soviets took the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So my father was in the general government. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Anyway when I read that I did pay attention to see if there was any word about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">There was description of deportations from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span> but I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">There probably are no records of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">In any case, for the sake of argument I say that my father was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I think he may have worked for the Jewish Council. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">He never said that. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">This is not a memory I have from him or from my mother or from my cousin Mutti who wouldn’t have known because my cousin Mutti could only give me information about the pre-war period because he left in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I have a memory from when I was a child of a friend of my father’s from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span> , a man who had been a worker of his in his <span class="DLF">lumberyard</span> who he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with and who had also survived and who remained a friend after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">He’s still alive, a man named Shaya May. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I think he’s still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">He was alive five years ago when my mother died because I called him but I assume he’s still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Shaya once I remember when I was a child, it was right after my father died, too, actually he was talking to my mother about my father during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">He mentioned something about my father working for that traitorous Council or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">A lot of Jews hated the Council. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">He was certainly not a member of the Council, of the 24 hot shots on the Council because I certainly would have come across his name if he were. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">The Warsaw ghetto Judenhad had several hundred employees so he may have known someone who knew somebody who got him a job on the Council. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">So he may have worked on the Council. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">From my memories of all the stories of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> years I don’t have any sense that he was in terrible shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Obviously all the Jews had very little food and fuel and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Things were very difficult in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettoes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">But his family was intact. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">He had a son and his daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">His son and daughter attended <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I think his wife taught <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">My mother said that. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Either she taught <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or she taught piano. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I think both stories, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So she was involved in this kind of moral resistance that took place, the organization of clandestine schools, and sort of doing moral and cultural and so forth things. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I don’t think I know very much more about the specific <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">QUESTION:  So you don’t know if they lived with other families or....?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">ANSWER:  That I just don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">The only person who might know is Shaya May but Shaya never wanted to talk about his experiences very much whereas my father talked about it all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I should add I have another source about my father’s experiences and that is that when he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , when he came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , the equivalent of “What I did on my summer vacation,” he had to write an essay about his experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">He had to write an essay that described his experiences during the war, I guess, so he wrote, I have part of that essay, part of it is missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">But he just says I suffered terribly and goes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">He doesn’t provide specific details about what it was like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">There was also, of course, the testimony that he provided to B. Goodmachen for the reparation claim which my mother typed and of which there is no copy although she swears she made one. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">She doesn’t know what happened to it and she suspects that my father actually destroyed the copy. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">But the copy just doesn’t exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Most of her memories I suppose come from that formal document that she typed for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So I don’t know if he lived with others or what the situation was. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Probably he did, most Jews did, it was a very crowded situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Most of his family, of course, was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow ghetto</span> although he had a brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Simcha was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and Simcha was shot for playing cards after curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">He was shot during the time of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I mean for not playing cards but after playing cards going out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">So Simcha died before the deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And he had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> because he had moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> already in the thirties or twenties or something and I don’t know why he had moved or what he did at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Again my cousin Mutti would probably know although he may not because since he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> he didn’t really know the war.....he actually knew my father the least well because my father was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">He remembers my father coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to visit twice or three times and giving him a ball or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">His stories are really best. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">From my cousin Mutti in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> I mostly learned about my grandmother, about Masha Rozenblit, because that was his grandmother, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Anyway so I really don’t know much about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> years except that things were okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">His brother was shot but things were reasonably okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Of course then came the deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">During the deportations from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow ghetto</span> , his mother was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">She was in her sixties and rather than take her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> or wherever they were taking the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> , they shot her. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Somebody must have witnessed that because how else would he have known, he wasn’t in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">She was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I assume the rest of his relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> , aunts, uncles, cousins, Shia and his family were probably just deported to wherever Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> were deported to and gassed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">QUESTION:  Do you know what year this was, was it 43?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">ANSWER:  No, well of all Polish Jewry, it’s ’42. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The operation Rhinehart which just simply went methodically and liquidated all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettoes</span> began something like March of ’42 and was over by October ’42 with some pockets left. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">That is there were Jews left in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> and in the....was it the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Yeah the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin ghetto</span> was made into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and a couple of other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">There were pockets where they allowed Jews to still continue. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Those were destroyed in ’43. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I assume that probably all of those relatives were killed in ’42 unless by some chance Shia or another one of his brothers was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , in the Jeneska Road labor camp or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poniyet Tovah</span> , I forgot there were a whole bunch of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> in the <span class="REGION">Lublin area</span> which maybe his brother or one of his nephews because if my father’s son was already twelve by that time then his older brother’s kids could have been teenagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So maybe they were in.....But I just don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I assume that everybody was just killed in ’42. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">His sister Nehama, though, who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow</span> with her family, you know I wrote down that her name was Pearlman but maybe her name was Bernstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Yes, her name was Bernstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Pearlman was my father’s wife’s maiden name. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">She and her husband who was much shorter than her, that was the joke of the family, that Nehama who was very tall, I presumably look like Nehama, -- that when I was a kid we would go to the Lukow Young Men’s Benevolent Association and all the people who had come from my father’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- and people would go Nehama, Nehama. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">They looked at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I don’t look like her in the pictures but they thought I looked like her. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">But anyway she and her family, her husband and her children (she probably had teen-age children) hid in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">They somehow escaped the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I don’t know if they escaped in 42 or if they escaped earlier but they were hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> near there in the <span class="REGION">Lublin region</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And they were only killed in ’44, about three months before the end of the war in that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">They were handed over by some Poles to the Nazis at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">So I don’t know what happened to them if they were then sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or if they were shot right away or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">But they did succeed in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Nechuma, I should be fair, her name was not Nehama, her name was Nechuma. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Actually she used a Polish name too, Helenie, she used the name Helenie. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">There are pictures on the back that say Helenie. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I think she was the only one that used a Polish name. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">My father didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">He used Mendel, his Yiddish name and all the others, Shia, Meir, they all used their Hebrew names. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">But she used both Nechuma and Helenie. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">But anyway, Nechuma and her family, that had been hiding for years, at least for two, maybe even more than two, were handed over to the Nazis by some Poles for (as my mother used to say, for a bottle of vodka). </span><span class="sentence" id="470">The Poles were given booty for handing over Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Now I don’t know if these people had just happened upon them and turned them over or if these were people who had been helping them all along and then turned them over, because often people were hiding with the assistance of Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Maybe it was neighbors, good Poles who were helping them who turned them over, who knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I think that most of his family, the Lukow branch of the family, his mothers and brothers and sisters, well whatever, there’s not that many brothers by that time because Simcha and his family were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and presumably they were deported in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Simcha had been shot earlier for curfew violations but presumably his family was deported in ’42 when most of the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lukow Haim</span> , his brother Haim Yakov had already gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> although his family hadn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">My father’s brother Haim Yakov had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in 1937 alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">His son Mutti, followed him in 1938 leaving the wife and the other children. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So they were all presumably killed also in ’42. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Shia was there and his family presumably were all killed and Nehama was there but she was in hiding until °44 when she was handed over to the Nazis, she and her family were handed over to the Nazis and killed and of course Meir was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and he was deported, I assume, again I don’t know this, but I assume he was deported in July of 1942 when the big raid in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> took place, July 16 I believe, 1942, when most Polish Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Now this is not necessarily true. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">He could have escaped to the south and have been picked up at some other time. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">He definitely was deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because after the war my cousin Mutti in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , he was too upset to deal with the issue but his wife Zeporah, spent months dealing with the Red Cross and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency to track down all the Rozenblit relatives, also her own relatives from her own family. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">But her family was mostly in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because they were all Zionist who’d come mostly in the 20’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">So she tracked them down and she found my father and she found nobody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So in fact the first time I saw those letters I wanted to cry because the first letter had to be in English, the Red Cross would only deal in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">So the first letter to my father that my cousin Mutti wrote to his uncle was in English so I could read it easily and my father didn’t know English yet but Mutti knew English and then of course all subsequent correspondence was just real letters because my father had a real address and that was all in Yiddish which I could read too but with much more difficulty so I didn’t read it quite as easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">But she found nobody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So I assume obviously she would have found -- there were all these organizations after the war, all these Jewish and non-Jewish organizations tracking down people. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So he was presumably killed either in °42 or 43 or 44, everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And Nehama definitely in 44. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Simcha at some point before ’42, everybody else in ’°42 except for my father and his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">In any case assuming that my father was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , his family was able to stay there after that initial depletion of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> in August/September of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">That confirms that he worked for the Jewish Council actually because the people who stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , the 70,000 or so that remained after the major liquidation either worked for the Jewish Council or were involved in SS industry, or whatever industry that was working for the German economy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">QUESTION:  Maybe that lent itself also to them having slightly better food conditions or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Also I think the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin ghetto</span> was simply, I read that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Orad</span> the Wolomin was totally destroyed in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So my father I know was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> until April of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">That’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , that April ’43 date is so fundamentally <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> that he had to have been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">In fact he always lit a yahrtzeit candle for his children at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pesach</span> because that’s around, I mean the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> was finally liquidated on the second night of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pesach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And they didn’t die that night. [</span><span class="sentence" id="501">ll tell that story in a minute but it was just a few weeks later. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So Pesach of 1943, so <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pesach</span> is when he lit a yahrtzeit candle for everybody then. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I don’t know, maybe because he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and that had such an impact on his conscience. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">His mother was probably shot at some point in 1942 not necessarily at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pesach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">My father, therefore, and his wife and his children and his wife’s sister who was crippled, not totally crippled but she schlepped a leg for whatever reason, they were together in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So he was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> after that liquidation in August/September 1942 when most of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So he was one of the 70,000 that stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> until April of ’43 when the Nazis decided on the final liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Now my father in 1943, he was born in 1907, so in 1943 he was 36. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Well he wasn’t yet because his birthday 1s November, so he was 35 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And he had a twelve-year old son and an eight-year old daughter and a wife and a sister-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And they decided to escape from the burning ghetto. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Because of the uprising the Nazis sort of bombed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and sent in firebombs and so forth and basically burned the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> down. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And my father and his family decided to escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I don’t know if that means they went through the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> that’s how people escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">This is where he really told. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">My father told the stories from the escape from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> until liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">That’s what he told. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> experience didn’t interest him. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">That must mean that it was not too terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">My image of hearing the story as a child was that they escaped into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">But there are no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> or around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> even for that matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">So I don’t know how they escaped, presumably they did it through the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">But in any case they escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Oh, I do know, my mother I think told me this that he did make attempts through Polish, non-Jewish friends to get his children to be taken by non- Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And nobody would do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">He was unable to get anybody to agree to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">So anyway there he was with his twelve year old, his eight year old, his wife and his sister-in-law and they escaped and somehow they made it to some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , or maybe not to some <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , they were just out. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">They had a kind of pact that if one of them should get lost, they would not look for that person because that could be problematic and instead if one of them should get lost, they should go to a <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> that they knew which was some distance away, my memory is 90 kilometers but I was a little kid when I heard this so I don’t know where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Somehow Avraham, my father’s son, who by the way was not called Avraham, that’s my way of Hebraisizing it again, it’s Avremy, the Yiddish nickname for Abraham. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Avremy who was twelve somehow got lost, he wasn’t there. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">My father’s wife said that she had to go look for Avremy and my father said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">We'll lose you if you do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">We have to stick together and go to the <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">We’ll find Avremy at the <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And she just was mad with concern for her son who’s not technically her son but she had raised him his whole life so he was her son. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And she went to look for him and they never saw her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I assume that means she was picked up by SS soldiers and by the SS and taken directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> which at that point was the only, by 1943 -- oh maybe not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , maybe she was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , I don’t know where she was taken to but she was presumably killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">But my father and his daughter and his sister-in-law did go to this <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and they found Avremy there without his shoes, a Polish farmer had taken them, probably he needed them, probably he thought that Avremy would be killed soon anyway, what did he need shoes for. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Who knows why he took them, but he took them. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">This is April of ’43, my father, Avremy, Toby and Tova whatever, and his sister-in-law whose name I don’t know and then they were arrested, they were found. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I mean it was very hard to really escape especially since the Poles were so hostile and the Nazis were so eager to find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And he was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">They were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Of course my father was 35, and the rest of them were not 35, they were twelve, eight, and I don’t know how old his sister-in-law was, presumably in her thirties too but she was crippled. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And she was as if the mother of these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">She was an adult female with two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And so when they got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , he was sent to the left or the right, whichever way. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">He was sent to do slave labor and they were sent the other way which means that they were gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So in April of 1943 his son and his daughter and sister-in-law were killed by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">But he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and he was a slave laborer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">He worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and he would talk about his experiences quite a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">He talked about how awful it was although I must say that he did not dwell on how awful it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">My father talked about his experience in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Saturday nights when we would have company, in the 1950’s if you were a Jewish family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> you would have bagels and lox for dinner, and we would have bagels and lox and herring and so on and company and he would talk . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">People would say Mark what was it like. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And he would talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And I just remember Saturday nights in my childhood hearing my father talk about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And when he talked about it he did not talk about the horrors so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">He certainly made it very clear that it was so horrific that you could not even imagine it. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And in fact when people would be nasty, nasty is the wrong word, but you know how Americans could be presumptuous and they would say, how could you have done such a thing? </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Like my father would say we found a rat and we ate it or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And they’d say, ooh how could you eat a rat? </span><span class="sentence" id="564">It’s not really nasty. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And he would say, you shouldn’t talk, you don’t know what it’s like to be in a fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I remember the expression, you don’t know what it’s like to be in a fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">But he wouldn’t dwell on how awful it was except to indicate that 1t was unbearably awful and constant beatings and starvation and filth and dirt and crowded and disgusting. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">He indicated that but that’s not what he dwelled on. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">What he dwelled on instead in his talking about it was the things that people did to survive and the things that people did to help each other survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">The image that I had as a child of what it was like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> was unbearable sadism and cruelty on the part of the Nazis but the inmates being human, working to do things that would make themselves survive and things that human beings do. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I don’t mean that human beings are pigs and do horrible things, but in the good sense of being human, that is if helping each other and working together to try to survive, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">For example he always spoke about what the memoirs all talked about, that is the whole business of organization, the whole network through which people bargained and traded and bartered and traded their bread for other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">He talked all the time of it how it was crucial to trade your bread for soap, or to trade your bread for an onion or for garlic or something and soap so you could clean yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Onions or garlic so you could get vitamins. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">All of that which I’ve read in umpteen memoirs but he talked about that all the time, about the need to trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Of course the whole network depended on pilfering from Nazi stewards and from the suitcases of people who came in to be gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">So he talked about that a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">He didn’t use the word organization as far as I can remember but maybe he did and I just don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">But he talked about that you really needed to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">He also talked, in fact more importantly than this whole organization business, he talked about holding on to the will to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">My most vivid memory I have from childhood, the most single vivid memory of my own childhood is my father talking about holding on to the will to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And that the only way you could survive such a horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> was to hold on to the will to live and that’s how you did it, you just held on to the will to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Like literally held on to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And every second said, I’m going to live, I’m going to live, I’m going to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I just remember that vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I don’t remember what he said how you did it, how you held on to the will to live or what strategies he used to hold on to the will to live, which I read about in memoirs, thinking about the past, thinking about the future, thinking about this, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">There are different strategies that people used. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">That I don’t remember, his own personal strategies. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">But I do remember him talking about that -- holding on to the will to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I also remember that of course it made him lose all faith in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Actually I don’t remember that, I take that back. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">He did lose all faith in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">But that he didn’t tell me about. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">My mother told me about that when I was older. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">He didn’t want me to know that because he didn’t think that was fair to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">He thought that I was a child and not know that he didn’t believe in God as a result of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And he didn’t believe in God because his children had been killed and everybody’s children had been killed not just his. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">That didn’t stop him from wanting to have a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> or from going to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">He didn’t stop being a Jew, you know what I mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Well, actually he did stop going to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> until I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">From the time the war ended until I was born he would not go into a <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> , he would not do anything religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">He would not go into a Passover seder, he would not do anything religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">No, that’s not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">He would go to a Passover seder. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I think that was the only religious thing he would do but he would not go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">When I was born he didn’t even think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">He went to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> to name me. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">He was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">That’s what eastern Jewry was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">You were a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">You did things because you were a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Jews named their daughters in <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">The angel of death might kill your daughter if you didn’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">You know you had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Just because you didn’t believe in God didn’t mean that you didn’t name your daughter in <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And that broke the ice and he went to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">He loved to go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">He absolutely loved to go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">He didn’t go every week, he wasn’t religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">But he went at least once a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">He really loved to go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">In fact he even wanted me to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish day school</span> but my mother didn’t want me to go because we weren’t that religious and in those days it was just <span class="BUILDING">orthodox schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Getting back to his experiences I don’t remember that he talked about how he lost his faith in God but that was a central experience that he had in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , the loss of faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION:  Do you remember any discussion of any specific episodes or incidents that he might have told you or other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember anything specific from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> except the business of trading bread for soap which is not a specific incident; I’m sure he did it more than once and the business of holding on to the will to live and the sense of how unbearable it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I think in his testimony for reparations he did provide some specific instances. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">But my mother, who unfortunately was terrible at details didn’t remember them and had lost the carbon copy. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I’m sure he was beaten mercilessly many times as was everybody, I mean he wasn’t singled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I’m sure there were but I really don’t unfortunately know any very specific thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">In terms of what he actually did in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> I assume he did a variety of labor things. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">He could be a carpenter so presumably when they asked him what do you do, he said I’m a carpenter and they did have him building. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">My mother used to say that he built <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="633">But they were already built by the time he got there so I don’t -- see my mother was really bad at detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">It was a shame. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I’m a historian concerned with detail and she wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And my father died when I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So I’m bringing all these memories of sitting around our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> listening so I can think of something very specific.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">QUESTION:  If you don’t have it that’s okay too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">ANSWER:  I remember that he would be annoyed with people who presumed -- like if he would discuss -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> for example he would say how it was wonderful when a horse would die and they would just eat the horse meat and people would say, horse, how could you eat horse, and he would say, lady, you haven’t been through a fire, you don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">People were in awe of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">He was a very intelligent man and they would sit there sort of enthralled with his stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I don’t remember a specific incident unless I keep on talking I'll come to something. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I don’t remember anything specific. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I do know that he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from April of ’43 until January of ’45 when the Russians -- so in terms of your dates through 1944 he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">In January of 1945 as you know the Russians came very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Knowing that the Russians were going to be there any minute the Nazis evacuated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> in the famous death march that Elie Wiesel and millions of other -- Isabella Leitner -- millions of other people described -- marched off people to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And my father was part of that death march. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I remember him describing that a little bit in more detail than the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I remember him saying that it was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">It was January, it was winter, and they didn’t have boots and they didn’t have coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Two thirds of the people died. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And I remember him saying that you couldn’t fall asleep because if you let yourself fall asleep you would die. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">The snow was deceptive. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">You think that it’s warm when you’re in it and so you could fall asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And then of course you freeze to death because 1n fact it’s not warm it’s cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">So you should never go to sleep in the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And I remember him saying that they would force each other to stay awake. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">In some of the memoirs I’ve read about how they were put in <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> , my father never talked about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">He just talked about the snow and how people straggled, they would be shot of course and the Nazis would beat people up. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">The Nazis were very nervous of course at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">He was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Other people went to other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">They were all taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="665">He personally was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> where he spent the next few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I don’t know how long it actually took him to get from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="667">In some of the memoirs you read how that part of the way they were on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">My father never said that. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">He just said the death march. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">He called it the death march and he said they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">So he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> for a few months and he was liberated by the Americans in April of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And I have a couple of little stories that I remember of the actual liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Not of the moment of liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Not of the moment of liberation although I have a wonderful story of somebody else of the actual moment but I won’t put this in my father’s record. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">It’s one of those classic stories, the other story of how this other person got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">The Nazis left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp before</span> the Americans got there and he was wandering around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and was almost shot by some American soldiers but he spoke Yiddish to them and one of them happened to be Jewish and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">That’s not my father’s story. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Right after liberation he and Shia, this person who had been his employee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolomin</span> before the war and had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with him and had been in the orchestra in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> actually, my father was just a laborer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> but Shia was in the orchestra and they were in the death march together and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And after the war they were walking around and Shia picked up a rotten potato from the <span class="DLF">street</span> that he saw and my father said what are you doing that for because now we have food. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And Shia was still too scared that there would be no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">But that again is not my father’s story because that’s not what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">He of course was nothing at the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">He was utterly emaciated and utterly depleted. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">My mother used to say he weighed fifty pounds at the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I can’t believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">But he must have weighed seventy or eighty. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">My mother was also an exaggerator a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">But I bet he weighed seventy pounds at the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">He was not a huge man anyway, he was probably about five nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">He was broad but thin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">QUESTION:  He must have been strong to have survived all the labor and all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">He was actually old to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Most of the survivors were teenagers, which is why they’re still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">My father if he were alive today would be in his eighties. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I mean he happened to die when he was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">He happened to die when he was fifty-three but even if he hadn’t died and if he were still alive the man would be eighty-four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">No, that’s not right. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Yes, he would be eighty-five on his next birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Whereas most of the survivors that you talk to I’m sure are in their seventies because they were teenagers or in their early twenties during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">My father was a very old survivor, very unusual, he must have been extraordinarily strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">It’s funny to say that somebody in their mid-thirties would already be no longer at the height of their physical strength but it’s true. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So it’s just amazing that he lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">But anyway he was liberated by the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">He did not go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> which was the standard experience but rather he went to work for the United Nations Relief and Restitution Agency and his job for them was to help people find <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">He must have learned English working for them or before but he lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">He had a real <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and had a real job and sort of went about his business. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I assume for a few months, I mean I assume that immediately after the war he was, it took months to recuperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">In fact he said that it was months before he felt like a human being again. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I do know that most of his teeth had rotted during the war and that one of the first things he did when he had some modicum of strength was he just walked around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and looked for a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">He found a dentist, walked in, asked the dentist to pull whatever was left and to give him false teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">The dentist wanted to give him anesthesia for the pulling and he said, no need. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">He was so into pain that it didn’t matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And the German dentist didn’t charge him because my father had a number, he had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">He just showed his number. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">In fact in those days you just showed your number and you got anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">He didn’t pay for too much after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">The <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> I think was also free.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  I was wondering about that because I talked to a number of people and they said well we just lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And I said how did you get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Well, we got food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">ANSWER:  Well, if they were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> they got food from the <span class="BUILDING">UN</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">QUESTION:  No, I mean in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">ANSWER:  But if they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> -- well my father worked, I mean my father had a real job, but before that he didn’t have the job from the first minute, I think it was not a problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">QUESTION:  There was guilt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">ANSWER:  Yeah, although the Germans didn’t have any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">They must have been given food by the American army of occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">He must have just been given it. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I don’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I know somebody who studies the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , she might know. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Anyway, so he wasn’t ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I assume he stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> because that’s what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">They set up <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and gave people food and medicine and let them come to themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">We have pictures of my father right after the war, not right, right after the war but in 46 where he looks fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">He had obviously regained his strength and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">But so he lived and worked for UNRRA and he did have <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> and he had a German, non-Jewish girlfriend who he lived with which 1s very weird. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And she knew Yiddish which 1s very weird.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">QUESTION:  I heard of some southern Germans who know Yiddish actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">ANSWER:  Well, yeah, she was a Bavarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">She was a beautiful woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Her name was Lisa, well probably Elizabeth, but Lisa was her nickname. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Just a beautiful woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Her husband had been a soldier probably and he probably had been killed and she was probably lonely and my father had access to food and people were starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">She wanted to marry him actually and he couldn’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">To live with her is one thing, to sleep with a shiksa is one thing; to marry a shiksa after you just ..... Lremember him saying he used to have dreams. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">His mother would come and beat him up in his <span class="NPIP">dreams</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">The very idea that he would even think of marrying a shiksa was -- a German shiksa no else. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Well, I mean from my grandmother’s point of view a shiksa 1s a shiksa, it doesn’t matter what kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">But the fact that she was also a German shiksa didn’t really help. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Ill show you her picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">She was gorgeous, just beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I have this huge urge to look her up although she’s probably eighty-five years old, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I mean at the end of the war how old was my father? </span><span class="sentence" id="754">In 1947 he was forty right. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And she may have been ten years younger so she would only be in her mid-seventies at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I don’t know her name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">QUESTION:  I think it would be interesting to learn something about her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">ANSWER:  I don’t know her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Her name is Lisa. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I don’t know her last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Although actually some of my father’s Lukower friends, that is the friends from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that he met again in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , they might know her name because she lived with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">All these pictures of my father and his other survivor friends in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">There she is, she’s with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">My father did know German though, he probably did speak to her in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Anyway, so he lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and had this job, joined the Zionist organization and stuff and then in December of 1947 he came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">That was right after Congress passed that emergency legislation allowing in 100,000 victims of Nazi persecution. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I guess because he worked for <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> he was able more easily than others to get an early seat in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And he came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in December of 1947 leaving Lisa behind in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I don’t think he ever had any contact with her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Maybe initially he did but not for very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">He got himself a job very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">It was the only job he ever had in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">He actually lived with a Lukower. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">He lived with Mrs. Feldman who had moved to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> God knows when. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">But her son, Muttel, who was my father’s friend in Europe and had survived the war also, and was my father’s friend in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , he lived with his mother, Mrs. Feldman. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Muttel came later to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">But he lived with Mrs. Feldman. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">He wandered around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">lower Manhattan</span> looking for a job, he got a job right away for a company called Civikoppen Minor which did store fixtures, you know <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> that’s inside <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And he worked both as a carpenter -- he knew how to work with wood, he owned a <span class="DLF">lumberyard</span> , and he was also very handy, actually more than handy. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">He was talented with his hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">He could build beautiful things and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">So he got a job there, initially I guess just as a carpenter since he didn’t -- I don’t know, whatever -- but he also worked for them supervising job installations. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">When they did <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bambergers</span> in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , he went out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bambergers</span> and made sure the job was done right. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And what he wanted more than anything was to save up enough money to open some kind of business. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">He was an entrepreneur by nature and that’s what he wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">He died before he could do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">But that’s what he wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So he got a job right away, I mean he probably got a job three days- oh actually I have a funny story to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">I know you’re mostly interested in the Holocaust but I love this story. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">When he came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> he was met at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> by his aunt, Judith Marcus, Marcusfeld shortened to Marcus. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Actually she was an aunt-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">She was his mother’s brother’s wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">His mother’s brother had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">They had come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> probably before World War I and had shortened the name to Marcus to make it more American. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Anyway his uncle was dead but Judith Marcus met him at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and she said to him, today I'll speak to you in Yiddish, tomorrow only English. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">You’re now in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , you have to speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Presumably he knew some English because he worked for UNRRA. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Today I will call you Mendel, but from now on you have to have an American name and your name 1s Mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">She gave him a name that was common in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="800">In 1947 Mark was acommon name. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">So in fact, when he became a citizen in 1951 he changed his name to Mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">So in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> he was Mark Rozenblit, although my mother called him alternate.....she called him Mark most of the time, but she called him Mendel when she was being affectionate because that was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Mendel was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">He was forty-four years old when he changed his name to Mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Although he used it, 1t was his American name. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">My cousins called him uncle Mark and my uncle called him - I mean everybody called him Mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Anyway he came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , was met by his aunt, he got a job, and he met my mother a year and a half later in June of 1949 and they got married in November of 1949 and they had me in October of 1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">The rest is history. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">He adjusted extremely well to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">He loved <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="811">He felt utterly happy to be American. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">He had an American wife which is unusual for survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">He didn’t feel the need to be -----of course he was friends with all the people who survived from his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="814">My mother hated them. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">They were a bunch of people who survived from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Actually a very large number considering how tiny the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Virtually all of them had been in the Partisans, except for Muttel. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">I think Muttel had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Everybody else, I forget all their names now, Frimmet. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">God, Frimmet, Frimmet and Dave Rosen. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">They’re so unlikely to have been in the Partisans, it’s amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And Chayetta whose son looked like somebody else, not her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">There’s this sort of crew of people that I grew up with. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Those people, I haven’t seen them in a hundred years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="825">QUESTION:  But they all ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">ANSWER:  They all ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , all the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">There were probably eight of them; it’s not like there were hundreds of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">But there were some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Some of them actually subsequently moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="830">In the 50’s and 60’s they lived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and 70’s and some of them retired to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Well Frimmet and her husband and the Feldmans, Muttel and Fanny moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="832">But I think Lola and her husband, I forget his name, they still live in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I mean, unless they’re dead, I haven’t spoken to these people in a hundred years, a hundred years, but a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">So my father adjusted very, very well to life in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="835">He really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">He didn’t want to have children because he lost two. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">He had one because he thought it wasn’t fair to my mother to impose that on her but he wouldn’t have any others because it was too much of a risk that you could lose your children. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">In a way I replaced his daughter; his son he mourned for continuously. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">He had nightmares all the time, all the time my mother said. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">I don’t remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">That was from my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">He was in his daily life in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">He joked and laughed and was successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">I mean not successful in the huge sense but he had a job and worked and made a living and he was saving money for a business and he had an American family. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I remember my father being loving and warm and it was fine in his waking consciousness but of course he was racked by nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">He missed his son profoundly. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">He was in excruciating pain at a barmitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">He had a very hard time at barmitzvahs because his son died just before his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">The loss of his children was really unbearable to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">The loss of everyone else he could handle but the loss of his children was unbearable to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">QUESTION:  That must have been a big responsibility for you really to have that position.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">ANSWER:  I felt it an honor. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I felt very privileged. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I felt very special as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I felt that I was privy, very close to tis horrible thing that had happened to the Jewish people and therefore that I understood it better than others. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I felt honored. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I felt terrible for my father and the family and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">But I felt very special. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I felt responsible, yes, but not in the negative sense of wishing that I didn’t have a burden but in the positive sense of feeling that I had a special responsibility to bear the information and the pain of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I knew lots of other people in the same situation though because although my mother was American and therefore all the family that I had was American, that is her family, we knew a lot of survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Both because of the Lukower, all of these people who had survived, but also because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> in the fifties when I was growing up there were survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">There were lots of survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">I had friends whose parents were survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Not all my friends, certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">In fact probably most of my friends didn’t have survivor parents but Elaine and Esther Rosenberg’s parents were survivors and whatever, I don’t have to name all the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">But there were plenty of other survivors around so it was not an unusual or weird thing at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">But yes I did feel a responsibility, a very great responsibility, probably magnified by the fact that he died when I was ten years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I remember, my father always talked about it, I do not remember a time in my life when I did not know about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">We didn’t call it the Holocaust, of course, we called it the war, or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> or the Nazis, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">So I don’t remember not knowing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I always knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">But I do remember the first time I saw pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">There was a series of pictures prepared by the American army for Germans so they would know how horrible the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And my father had a set. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">In the back it said “Zo vais in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ” So it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="876">It was horrific pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">You know those really gross <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> pictures from the end of the war when things were even worse, because there were bodies lying all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And I remember I was eleven years old when I came across those pictures and I vomited. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">I remember that very vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">I mean this wasn’t a picture of my father, of course, my father was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Not then, he was already dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Yeah, I felt this great responsibility because of it, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Anyway what else would you like to know about the whole thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="884">QUESTION:  I think that should probably cover it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">ANSWER:  As much as you guys need, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">If there’s anything else that you feel you want to include for the sake of this interview and have it in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> we can turn off the tape and if you think about it, you can tell me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="888">ANSWER:  Yeah, I’m just trying to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">You know of course I’m not the survivor so I can’t give you the details that your survivors are giving you. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">My father also did die when I was ten which means that I didn’t get a chance to question him and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">My cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> could only provide information about <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">My mother was bad at detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">So it’s a hard thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Let me just think of a few other things randomly. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">My father taught me not to hate all Germans because of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">He thought the Nazis were evil but he didn’t hate all Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I mean I think the fact that he had a non-Jewish girlfriend is a sign of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">He taught me that. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">He taught me that I had to distinguish between people. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Nazis were evil but not all Germans were evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I probably did get the sense that all Poles were anti-Semitic in my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">That is, I think Polish Jewry in general thought that although no, no although. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">That was the sense I probably got. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">I got the sense that obviously most people were killed but that those who survived did so not because they were awful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I mean there was this notion in certain circles especially in the fifties that the people who survived had been vicious and horrible and mean and had killed each other and been dog eat dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">From my father I learned that you survived because you were clever. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">You held on to the will to live so you were strong psychologically. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">You were clever. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">You figured things out. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">You were lucky, gutsy. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">That’s what made you live, not being underhanded and mean but being tough and strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">In fact I had a wonderful experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I went to the first international gathering of Holocaust survivors in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1981 and I in fact gave a paper on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">I gave a paper on teaching the Holocaust at the university level. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">But I went to not all the sessions but many of the sessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">I went to the final session which was held at the kotel, at the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , when there were speeches. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Menachem Begin spoke and Teddy Kollack spoke, everybody spoke, millions of speakers, all in English, really weird. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">But anyway English was the common language because there were French survivors and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">Anyway so I went to it and it got real cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">It was at night in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> in the summer and I was wearing a jacket and I was feeling very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Begin, maybe he wasn’t the last speaker, but he was one of the last speakers and he was going on and on endlessly. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Everybody else had spoken for two minutes because thee were hundreds of speakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">He was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">He was already prime minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">He was going on and on and he was really being nasty. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">He was exhorting the crowd that if they didn’t live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> they were traitors to the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">It was a really not nice, disgusting speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Half the crowd started to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">They just started to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">They picked themselves up and they walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">My <span class="REGION">American side</span> , that is my Protestant side, I mean I’m not a Protestant but you know what I mean, the <span class="REGION">American side</span> that you just stand on <span class="DLF">line</span> whatever, was appalled that they would do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Because, after all, even if you hate him, even if you think he’s saying awful things, and I certainly don’t agree with Menachem Begin politically and I though what he was saying was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">But still he’s the prime minister of a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="934">You don’t get up and leave in the middle of his speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">It’s just not nice even if you’re cold and even if you’re unhappy you don’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And so I was really annoyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">My sort of <span class="REGION">American side</span> that hates when people cheat on <span class="DLF">line</span> was getting very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And then all of a sudden like I had this revelation, wait a second, that’s why they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">They just do what seems to them the right thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And then I loved them because I remembered all these survivors from my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">My father’s dead for a long time and I’ve moved away from that world and I just loved them and I wanted to kiss all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I didn’t leave because I’m not them. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">But they left because that’s why they not only survived but they also succeeded after the war in returning to normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">The vast majority of the survivors are normal, functioning human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Even if they’re a bit neurotic, even if they scream a little too much, even if they have more fears than your average person, even if they are way more over-protective of their children, than your average person, even all of those things and even if their children say oh my parents were such crazy people, they are functioning human beings, they are not lunatics. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And the ones who are were lunatics anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">The ones who are were lunatics before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">This had a searing and traumatic and devastating effect on them but they function as human beings, successful ones for the most part. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">There are lots of successful business people, successful professionals. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">All the survivors I know as children all of them made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Even if they were just laborers, they still went to work in the morning and they still provided for their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">They were fine, they were really fine; crazy but crazy in a way that’s understandable. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">But anyway so I love them all because they are what they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">They survived because they have the courage to do what feels right at the moment instinctively. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I don’t know if there’s anything else I can say at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">This is not about my father’s American experience and that’s of course what I’m most familiar with. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">He had a good one. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">He spoke English all the time to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">They spoke Yiddish when they didn’t want me to understand which was enough so that I did understand Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">He was fiercely proud of being Jewish even if he wouldn’t fast on Yom Kippur because he didn’t believe in God anymore and he’d gone hungry long enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">But I didn’t know he didn’t fast on Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">He didn’t want me to know that because ......1 mean I’m sure he would have told me if I was older, but I was little. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I think that’s all I have to say, at least now. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">If I think of something in the next ten minutes we can always add it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">I want to thank you very much for your time and for this interesting story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="967">ANSWER:  You’re welcome, you’re welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Let me add just one last thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">I know this is not going to go into the cards that you’re doing but somehow the transcripts of these will be saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">QUESTION:  Yes they will.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">ANSWER:  So Pll just say it. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">My son is named for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I’m named for my father’s mother and he’s named for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And so therefore we have Masha and a Mark and a Marsha and a Mark and it’s very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And he really feels connected to my father and to the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">He has always known about it and you asked me if I feel a sense of responsibility and I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">I feel it both in my professional life and in my personal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And I’m very pleased that I was able to tell my son about the Holocaust in a way like I learned about it, in a very personal way, in a way that emphasizes the goodness in all human beings but it also emphasizes that we should be careful about the evil that human beings are capable of and I feel that as a child of a Holocaust survivor that I have a moral obligation to purvey the meaning of the Holocaust to the next generation and I’m glad I was able to do it with my own son. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">A lot of children of Holocaust survivors are worried how they will do it and I think it can be done easily, so thank you for interviewing me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="980">QUESTION:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="981">ANSWER:  I have one more thing to add, I just remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">When the Nazis occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in 1939, my father’s wife said to him, escape to the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> , you can do that for a couple of months in September, October, November of 1939; you go escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">After all the Germans won’t hurt women and children but they might hurt men. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And my father said well it’s true the Germans certainly won’t hurt women and children because after all his memories, like most Polish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">His memories of World War I were that the Russians were the horrible creeps but when the German army came and occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> the situation of the Jews improved. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">The Germans were civilized and nice and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">So he had a sense that the Germans wouldn’t be so bad but he didn’t want to go to the east because he thought that the Russians would be very barbaric and he didn’t want to go to the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">He said the Germans are more civilized than the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I will take my chances with the Germans and I don’t want to leave my family alone and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">So the image of the German was this positive one which of course worked to the detriment of lots of Polish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">That’s all I wanted to add...
QUESTION:  Thanks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="992">ANSWER:  You’re welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">My father understood that Hitler was a maniac and that the Nazis were evil and that they were doing terrible things to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">He understood that. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">He just thought that ultimately German decency would prevail whereas the Russians were utterly repulsive and that it was at best to stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with family and take one’s chances with these Germans than go off to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="996">QUESTION:  Okay. </span>
