<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you state your name and birth date please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name Klaus Meier, and I was born on March 29 in 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , near the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> , where my parents lived in a kind of a community, socialist, agnostic, semi-religious, because they felt that the only way people can live together in peace and harmony is by each one giving what he can and receiving only what he needs for life. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My father will tell his own story. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My mother has passed away already, but he was seeking for a long time to find this justice between people. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">As I said, I was born in a little <span class="DLF">farm</span> there which they had rented. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And while they were living in community there, they got to...1nto contact with another community which started in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 1920. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I want to give a brief history of this community because it's important. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Everett Arnold, a son of a missionary in <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> , sent there by the Arnold family from <span class="REGION">North America</span> had also had this great longing in his heart to find what the way of Jesus 1s, the way of justice, peace and love, which the prophets and the Tennah speak all about all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And after much searching and seeking, (clearing throat) passing through the first World War, he felt that what is told in Acts 2 and 4, that they were one heart and one soul should be lived and practiced to meet this need for justice and love and peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He started in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 1920, and he was always on the look, this man Everett Arnold and his wife, on the look out for other people who had similar longings. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So he got into contact with my parents on the little community in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My father (clearing throat) was ...uh...he rejected...he took part in the military in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , but rejected it. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He couldn't see killing people as being just and so he lost his...all his possibility for higher paid work. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And on this <span class="DLF">farm</span> they were milking cows, working in a cooperative and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">The community in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bruderhof</span> heard about his stand of non- violence, his refusal of military service, his going to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for this in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and Everett visited my father in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and later on had contact always tried to encourage him not to give up community. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">The problem was that in a socialist agnostic community like my parents were in...as my father says, there's always as many ideas as there are idealists, and unless you find unity in community it will break apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The tensions are too great. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So in this Swiss community, they didn't find unity. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">The question of education, how to spend the money, how to work, what to...what part to take politically, all these questions divided the members. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Whereas in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bruderhof</span> , the community in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , there was a unity which was possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">You could feel it, but it was Christian and my father couldn't stand Christianity as preached by the big world <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> , the Catholics and the Protestants. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Well, when I was 10 months old, my parents...this community in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> didn't dissolve exactly, but one couple after the other went..uh...because they were disappointed with the life of that community and joined the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And my parents joined that community in 1933, in February, a month after Hitler came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Right from the beginning...now this is what my parents tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Right from the beginning, Everett Arnold said to the whole community, to the members, "Hitler has come to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Now we have to decide will we reject that nationalistic spirit? </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Are we willing to give our lives for what we believe or not? </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And on this question, some left. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My parents stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">On...I...] had three other brothers born to my family in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Andreas Meier, my second brother; Hansjurk Meier, and Daniel Meier. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I do not remember any kind of persecution in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself, but I remember fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Just fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And when I talked to my parents later about this whole question, they told me that already in 1933, there was six policeman who searched the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Later on, in 1933, there was a referendum in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> about whether....Hitler wanted to know if the German people support his policies. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">The members of the Bruderhof put little slips on the...on the voting papers, on the referendum papers, saying, "We respect the government, but we have a leader who is Jesus and we will not...we will serve only him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="37">When the...5 days after this referendum which was in November I believe...uh...there was a big group of Nazi of Gestapo...Nazi soldiers and policemen came and raided the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">They took away books with red covers, proving that we were communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They took away minutes of our meetings and...uh...so this went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">My father then was sent to take important documents to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> out of the reach of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">My father was then sent with another Swiss man to the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to find out what they had in mind with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Everett Arnold always felt we have to go to top men to find out, and not to the second, third or fourth echelon in the power structure. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , my father went to the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and they got in there which was also a fearful thing I think, and the man there told them that he had enough reason to dissolve the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> right because in one of our meetings, Everett had said that the Nazi state shows the character of all states, but it showed it clearest of being from the beast of the ___, which according to CHristian beliefs in the book of Revelation is the opposite of God's love. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">The beast of the ___ is the opposite of God...of God. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So this Nazi man said, "Just for having said that, we must dissolve you because you are against everything which the Nazi government represents.” </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Then...so I heard this from my father, and then I know that in 1934, the Nazis sent a school inspector into our <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> which they had asked the children to sing the national anthem which they couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We had not taught that. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And they said, "We will close your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or send German teachers.” </span><span class="sentence" id="49">This we could not tolerate, so we took our children to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">My father was instrumental in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">In <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , our school children were rejected. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They did not get permission to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The Swiss government said, "Be obedient to your government. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Why take your children out?" </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So they did not understand us. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And for this...
QUESTION:  You recall...what <span class="NPIP">part</span> do you recall as how it affected you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  I was then...uh...2, 3 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I was not in this school children who left who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bruderhof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I stayed on the _<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bruderhof</span> with my parents being Swiss and in some way protected from the...from the Nazis, from the German officials. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But I remember then for myself as the death of my fourth...third brother, Daniel Meier. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">He was born in __ on March 29, 1937. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And I remember my father taking me to my mother in the <span class="BUILDING">Fulda hospital</span> to see this little baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And the 14 days after he was born, came the raid which... where the Gestapo...uh...confiscated and destroyed the community as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">They occu...they came in the early morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">They surrounded the whole community and they told everybody to get into the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , the laundry. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Just leave everything and be in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I don't remember getting and ask questions or so but I remember the picture and the fear which...which I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And the governments...the...the Nazis said, "Leave right away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But there was my mother 14 year old baby...and the weather was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">There was some sick people. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So we asked them to let us go when the weather is a bit better and we...so they let us stay there | day longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And then I remember how with a bundle on the shoulder, we all got...they took us into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and they took us to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...I believe in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fulda</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I'm not ...I'm not quite clear to which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fulda</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , then they took us to the <span class="DLF">Dutch boundary</span> and pushed us over the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I've often wondered why my father went to the...to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fulda</span> for various reasons, the Nazis can't close the community as because they figured we were enemies of the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But when they found out there were two Hutterian brothers and I have to explain this, present from <span class="REGION">North America</span> , they changed the accusation into criminal bankruptcy to have a legal handle to get rid of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Now I remember these two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And they are descendants of ...uh...people that in the 60th Century in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> , which is today <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , began a life in community like we live it today. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And they were persecuted by the Catholics to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">By the Catholics, the Protestants, the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and the governments. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">They found refuge in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> because hundred years before this,___, there was a spiritual awaking and there was more tolerance in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> than in the rest of the Austrian empires. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And we Hutterians were persecuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I think more than two thousand were burned, killed, decapitated or drowned, whatever they did, and they fled from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , then later on to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">They lost the community life on two occasions, and it started again. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">On hundred years ago, in 1874, they migrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because the Russian who had promised them exemption of military service, wanted to force them to do military service. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But they refused and migrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Now, two of these...excuse me, I have to go back now. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Everett Arnold and the Bruderhof in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , when they heard in 1928 about that there were...that none of the Hutterian brothers had done military service in the world war; that they had been persecuted economically and with hate and in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> for not being anti-German in the first world war, many of them were taken prisoners and two of them were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alcatraz</span> and later on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Levinsworth</span> , and they died from exposure because of the treatment they got from the American military. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">After they had died, there were...they put the uniforms on and sent the bodies <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They refused to put the uniform on while they lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">This we heard in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , published in the Mennonite newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And Everett and the Bruderhof felt here is a group that unanimously stick to their principles, even unto death. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">This is something we have to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So Everett himself went in 1930 to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hutterian communities</span> in <span class="REGION">South Dakota</span> , <span class="REGION">North Dakota</span> , and I believe some over in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> ; visited them all and united with them, 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He came back in at the end of 30, I think, or at beginning of 31. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Hitler came to power in 33. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And in 1937, two of these American and Canadian brothers were visiting the community in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> just the time when the Nazis...uh...confiscated the whole lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">When...the Gestapo searched everything, they met up with these two and they pulled out their American passports and said, "Sorry, we don't allow this. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">You cannot search us. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">We are American citizens.” </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And there the Gestapo got afraid about propaganda in...1n <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and changed the accusation from, as I said, enemy of the state to criminal bankruptcy which my father can tell how that worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So we left then <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1937 and I...I thought a lot about why...why is it that all of us escaped without a single one dying in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And I don't really know the answer except that I believe God protected us. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But I know from our <span class="NPIP">side</span> we did not compromise at any point with the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We did not raise an arm in salute. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We did not go along with his politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We didn't try to...uh... sort of inch our way in and be friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We all...not I. I was a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But the brothers and sisters and always said clearly where they stood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  How...how did it affect you at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  As I said, I was 5 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I was just afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">That's all I know, and from...from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">At certain times, I was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And other times, I was a child growing up in this community very much cared and loved for.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Do you have any memories of what was going on in the community to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> that caused this fear in you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  Uh...I...I'm told that also before 37, there were different raids going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And my father was away often for the community in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> finding refuge for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Later on in 35, when the general conscription started, he was off trying to help people. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">His absence I feel I must have felt that as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">This 1s...this is what I can say. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But apart from...from this fear I'm talking about, I had a very protected childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">It was in...within the community, it was protected.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  How did the community protect you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  I...bY the...I think it was by the...by the love and the confidence that God would led this...see this thing through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  How did your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> live at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Our community lived on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I'm not quite sure how many <span class="REGION">acres</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">They were farming. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">They were learning to farm because in the beginning 1920, they were all city people, professors and intellectuals, but they were determined to ...to agriculture, and the farming was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">The <span class="REGION">land</span> was hard and they had a lot of work needed to establish a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We lived in <span class="BUILDING">community houses</span> like the kibbutz do today. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We had our own <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">preschool</span> and <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Children were educated in their age groups by members of the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So the influence from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> was very low or nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Was the community self sufficient?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  It was self sufficient up to a point. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">We took...the community took in any kind of wayfarer...overnight gave him food and <span class="BUILDING">lodging</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Asking them to work, which they did mostly rejected. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We had many visitors, and economically we were doing bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Not because...so much because of inexperience, but right from 1933 on, the Nazi government tried to strangle us economically. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">How this exactly worked, I'm not sure, but I heard that at one point they...they forbid...they didn't give us the license to sell our products. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We farmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We had <span class="DLF">wood tannery</span> , and we printed books. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And the sale of books and <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span> was part of the cash income, where as the <span class="DLF">farm</span> was the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We...we never sold food. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We always just grew food for our own use. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And when the...when police...uh...prohibited us from selling then this took away cash and that made it difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">There was a time in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when we had friends outside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who gave us money, which was stuck in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I forget what the term is. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They didn't allow foreign...foreign currency to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so friends gave us that money and the <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would not give us the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So they made our life more and more diffuclt. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We took in children from broken <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and needy situations, which the German government of the Weimer republic had paid for. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They gave a certain amount of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Well, this was stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And so here we were with the children and not getting an help either. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So this is what made the economic situation very difficult and more and more so. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They forbid guests of staying overnight which we didn't listen to. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We didn't accept that. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And...uh... (clearing throat) so now I think I got to the point that we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and my personal story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  How old were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  I was then 5 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And I remember one of the Hutterian brothers carrying my little brother of 2 weeks....of 2 weeks of age in his arms, and my mother...we all had a bundle on our back and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I'm very thankful that we could leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Many, many others could not leave or did not leave in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , the group called the Mennonites took us in very warmly. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">The Mennonites are a group that also started in the 16th Century and belonged to the so-called anti-baptist movement, and they started in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> if I remember correctly, but fled to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> whereas the Hutterians went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  How many of you did they take in in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  I think we were about 50 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Let me say something. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">In 1933, we were about 120, but when the children had to be... had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we started a new community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichenstein</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And members of the German community had to move over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichenstein</span> to support this group of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So that was also a weakening of the economic situation, to hold...to maintain two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> is much more difficult than one. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So when the Nazis confiscated the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I think we were about 50 people...children and grownups. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Some when to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichenstein community</span> called __ <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bruderhof</span> , and the others went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> where we had already started a community because of the tense political situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">The young men who received military service in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> escaped illegally across the <span class="DLF">boundary</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichenstein</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichenstein</span> the government was very friendly to us, and gave us refuge. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And when Hitler started to put his fingers out for these resisters in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichenstein</span> , they let us know about it, and they said, "Get out of here fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Hitler is asking about...not Hitler personally, but the German government.” </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So when this happened we needed to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> somewhere else to go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And this <span class="NPIP">place</span> we found in German...in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">So as we left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1937, there was already a community in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We tried to get into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , but couldn't because they wanted an affidavit of support, the British government. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So the Mennonites took us in for 2 months, and they...we slept in their <span class="BUILDING">church buildings</span> , in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They gave us toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">They made collection amongst themselves for toys, for blankets, for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Everything they...they simply supported us for 2 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I remember very well we never had any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">roller scooters</span> 1f...1f that's what you call two wheels on a board and a handle. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we...we didn't have enough money for such things, but in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , there were nice, black topped <span class="DLF">paths</span> and <span class="DLF">roads</span> and we got these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">roller scooters</span> with rubber tires. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Not wooden, but rubber, and we scouted around. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">That was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Now (clearing throat) I'm told that I wrote a letter from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to my father who was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> with the Nazis in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fulda</span> , and in that letter I did...I didn't write, I dictated this to my mother saying, "If the government...German government doesn't let my father free, I'm going to come with the whole...and knock the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> down.” </span><span class="sentence" id="196">My father received this letter in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and everybody laughed about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And then I remember when we traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , we crossed the <span class="DLF">channel</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And we were a group of 30 or 40 people...children, mostly children and...uh...some of our brothers and sisters from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> came over to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And one of them was called Adolph Brown. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">He was a very hugh man, 6 feet or more, and quite a...quite heavyset, and he took...he took care of me and my brother because my father wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And I remember crossing the <span class="DLF">Channel</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Then we came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , we had started this community called the ______ <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bruderhof</span> , near _.. I'm not quite sure geographically where it's situated. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> was also a agricultural community, and we started farming right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">We built <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> then all, the whole community gathered. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichenstein</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 150 people about altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">There was an increasing war fever because Hitler was doing his thing, and everybody was getting ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And so it was a time of decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And many English people felt that violence is not the answer to human problems, and so in the 4 years we spent in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> from 37 to 40...or 36 to 40, the size of the community doubled with English..uh...men and women, married and single, old and young, who felt that a life in community without wages, working together, serving each other instead of expecting service, was the answer to our human needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And so the community doubled in this size. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">We had this one community, ___. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We had another <span class="DLF">farm</span> close by, 5 miles, called <span class="DLF">Telling farm</span> , and ____ <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bruderhof</span> ,, the third one. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And I remember this time quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I was 5 to 9...9 years of age. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And maybe what could help most for the...for my story now 1s that there was a time when in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> when all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> had to be black outed. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I believe that was when the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And so we did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">We had built three <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> 1n <span class="ENV_FEATURES">willow trees</span> along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">brooks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">All these <span class="BUILDING">tree houses</span> were taken down because the English people were afraid we would be signaling the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Being Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">They forgot we had escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They just saw us as Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">The...I wasn't German. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I'm Swiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">But they..they made us take all these <span class="BUILDING">treehouses</span> down. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">They took...put concrete pillows in the meadows so we wouldn't let the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German airplanes</span> land and they even...uh...made <span class="DLF">ditches</span> so that nothing could... They were very scared of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And I...I'm very sorry for that because I...I don't understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">They were so scared of us that this fear turned into hatehood, and on one occasion, at least, the surrounding...some of the surrounding population came half drunk, enraged, to burn the community down. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">The atmosphere in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was very warlike atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">You either were for the English and against the Germans or you were an enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">This kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">The community supported itself partly also by having a merry-go-ground, a vegetable ground, bread, butter, eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">This was finished from one day to the other nearly, because they feared...rumors were going around that we were putting poison in the milk to kill English children. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So this atmosphere also I felt as a child living in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">We had many air raid practices, living in the <span class="INT_SPACE">3rd floors</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">manor house</span> getting into the bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I remember packages of dried banana and some chocolate and nuts in case we were stuck down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And I remember also that...uh...a German bomb dropped very close or on our <span class="REGION">property</span> while we were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">This all made an atmosphere of fear, which I also felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">But within the community I...I felt safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">It...1t wasn't a personal feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">It was a general...a feeling of...of...uh..of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Now, I also remember that while we were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , we were approached by a Zionist group and asked if we could train some Jewish people in the _____, preparation for kibbutz life. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And I think 40 or 50 came and spent some time with us, learning to work in agriculture. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> now in 1985, I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz Hasara</span> , with my father and some others, and we met some of these who have been in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> 40 years ago, which was very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  Do you know where these people came from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  Where they came from? </span><span class="sentence" id="247">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But I think...no, I don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And from Europe, from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , probably I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Then the community also took in Jewish orphan children from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We had friends who asked if we could help and we...I'm not sure of the number. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I hear about maybe 12 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And one of them, Lotta Berger, who came <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> who had lost her parents....they were killed...came to us and she is still with us today. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">She married. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">She became a member and she married under the family, a very good friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And (clearing throat) so we lived there in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And then in 1940, and in 1939, because of the antagonism of the surrounding people...the government was friendly to us, but the people were very afraid of anything German. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So the government hinted to us it might be better to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> because if the tension grew, they would have to intern us for our own sake. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Another thing which happened to us in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was because of this war fever which could be compared to what happened in <span class="REGION">North America</span> with the Japanese and the <span class="REGION">West Coast</span> after Pearl Harbor, this kind of psychosis or whatever it is, made it that the...the police said, 'No Bruderhof member could pass the radius of 5 miles outside the community.” </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And when somebody did that they, this was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">They got us...we could get permission to leave further than 5 miles, but we had to get permission every time. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">This was another thing I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German airplanes</span> flying overhead. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">You could hear by the noise of the motors that they were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German airplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I don't...I cannot explain it. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I was told this. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And they...they bombed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Coventry</span> , of course and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birmingham</span> and many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">In our community, we always represented that we have to love the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Not only the fellow man, but also the enemy because only love can break the vicious cycle of violence. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">You kill me. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">This kind of thing can only be broken and this is what I understand 1s God's will for us actually, that we should love people and leave the revenge to God as is spoken about many times by the prophets especially. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So then when the government hinted that it's better for us to leave, my father was sent to <span class="REGION">North America</span> in 1940 to find out 1f we could come to <span class="REGION">North America</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , because we are brothers over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> they wouldn't let us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">They had enough trouble with those COs, conscientious objectors living in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Our brothers in <span class="REGION">South Dakota</span> offered us a whole <span class="DLF">farm</span> , ready with <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> , machinery and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So my father went to the...came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , lived in the student union down here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> for 3 months and from there traveled with another brother to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , <span class="REGION">South Dakota</span> , trying to find the help that we could immigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">The government was very much in favor. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">My father breakfasted with Eleanor Roosevelt. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">She was in favor of us coming, but she said her husband needs to make the decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">There was different Senators who tried to help us, but there was a _ election campaign of President Roosevelt, and we were advised it's not good to come at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Wait til January or February after the inauguration. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">As I think about this, the question comes why? </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Well, we all have clothing like I have it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Black clothing, beards, which in those days were very rare. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We don't salute the flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I don't salute the flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I have respect for the government, but I can't pledge allegiance for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">It goes against my conscience. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And so all these things made the government aware that 1t might not be a good moment to come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And then my father went to the Mexican government to see if he could go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">It didn't work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And then the Mennonites again helped us to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> , <span class="REGION">South America</span> , which is in the heart of <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">We didn't know where this <span class="NPIP">place</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We looked it up on the map. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Now, my father was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I was still in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And when we heard we could travel to <span class="REGION">South America</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> , we started reading books about the <span class="NPIP">place</span> because we'd never even heard of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And we read about snakes and jungles and monkeys and...uh...diseases, all kind of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And then the British government made possible for us to sell everything, get the value of it, and they made it possible for us to take everything we needed out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And I and my family with...together with, I think, 70 of the community, we were on the first group. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We left <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in 1940 I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">39 or 40, I'm not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We went...traveled in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burn</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> , spent the night there in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> which I remember from...went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">There was big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and everything, but there was always the danger of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> , of course, in the night so we had to be ready to...to run down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and into the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Nothing happened that night, and I remember getting on to this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> called _____, which the British government used to bring meat in from <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> specially. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And they had one class, which was first class, and then it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight ship</span> actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So 80 of us got on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and then everything was black out. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And I remember the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> sailing or steaming or whatever you call it...criss-crossed their way sub...uh...submarine attacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">This was at the height of the submarine war when the Germans more or less controlled the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> around <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So it...that was also dangerous, and we were aware of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I was 9 years, and I remember how on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> then, I once had...I had a flashlight and I took it out in the gun ware and shone it, and everybody came and really hushed me up because that was a dangerous thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I wasn't aware of what I was doing, but there was great fear of anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We had a very nice time on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I enjoyed it very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">They gave us very good food in the first class, and there was a big <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and films and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I was aware of the situation but not to the depth of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">As a child...I was a 9 year old, I enjoyed it also very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">We crossed the Equator and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rio de Janeiro</span> , the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> we saw in full lights at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">It was a wonderful sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buenos Aires</span> , transferred from the oceanliner to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">river boat</span> , and there I saw my father again. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">He had gone through <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> and looked at different possibilities and met us in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , but you couldn't come on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> because we were only...they'd only...uh...pass us through...cross <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">We...we couldn't...this was under police escort and we were put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> with all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> and police escorted us from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oceanliner</span> to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">river boat</span> , so that nobody could run away and get into <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So we traveled up this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , Paraguay Parana, 4, 5 days at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Third class. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">It got hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">We ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ascunion</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> , I think at Christmas time, which is south of the equator; therefore, it's the hottest time of the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And then we transferred to another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and went up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Paraguay River</span> another 4 or 5 days til we came to ____, which 1s very close to northern...to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> in the northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">There we got...uh...unto to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> without bump...without cushion bumpers without...it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">We couldn't drink water. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">It all had to be coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So I was trying...I was remember the part of Paraguay Ascunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">The...the food on the living conditions on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">We were on the bottom of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I think there were three or four tiers of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , and I remember now, there are no lights on this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">The Captain has to steer the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> by the seat of his pants, as one says. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> rises and falls and the <span class="DLF">sand banks</span> come and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">It's wild. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> gets...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> gets stuck sometimes on <span class="DLF">sand banks</span> and ...uh...so we were the only one that traveled in the bottom of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">The next groups and there were maybe 10 more, they traveled first class or second class for safety's sake. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So we got up to this <span class="BUILDING">Chaco station</span> ...uh... __, and there we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> 144 to kilometer 144. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Now you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">There were young babies, mothers, expecting mothers, fathers, everything...old people, young people, on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> traveling 144 kilometers into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bush</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Another name for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Chaco</span> is <span class="NPIP">Green Hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And I can't confirm it is...1t is <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Many sand storms; hardly any water; very hot, and very inhos...inhospitable; poisonous snakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">You name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Tarantulas, diseases. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">All this is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And kilometer 144 we had to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">We were heading toward <span class="REGION">Mennonite colonies</span> , and if you remember I said that in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , Mennonites had helped us. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">When our immigration to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was not possible, again, Mennonites helped us find this <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> and they alerted their members there to...we are coming and so kilometer 144, we waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">It got dust. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Some horses <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> were supposed to arrive to fetch us. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">They didn't come. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">They didn't come. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">But in the end they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I think there must have been 20 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Horse wagons</span> from 2 horses to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with wooden wheels, metal rimmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">We put our baggage on and everybody got on and we started off. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">It was so dusty you choked and could hardly see anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">We drove...we went through the night and stopped for a couple of hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Around midnight, scared of snakes, but no...nobody got bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And the next day, we arrived at this colony in the Gran Chaco of <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanheim</span> , where Mennonites who had fled from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and who had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> I think to avoid public education by the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">They wanted their own <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">They'd come to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chaco</span> in 19...1n the 20s, so by 1940, they were quite well established. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">But they told us about many difficult hardships which they experienced there. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Now, when we got there, they had prepared a banquet for us in their <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> , white table cloths, coffee with milk and sugar, home baked bread with butter, and home made cheese, and I can still taste it to this day if I think of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">It was so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">The families slept in the <span class="BUILDING">school houses</span> which the Mennonites had. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">It was holidays and...uh...I remember we stayed about 2 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And while we were staying there, the...the...my father and others looked around for a suitable <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the community could settle, where we could start building <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and live a community life again. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And they traveled around. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">This I hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I...I didn't do it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">They traveled around. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">It was very difficult to find any <span class="NPIP">place</span> , because wherever you go, you needed water. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And the water in that Chaco part is all brackish water, very hard, but bitter and to find a sweet water well was a rare thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">The other thing that concerned us as we lived there for 2 months, we heard that the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chaco</span> is a <span class="REGION">military area</span> under the...under the government of the military institution, which we also didn't like too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Now, I remember as a child...oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">When we were there, my...let me think. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I have three brothers...four brothers live in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> a sister was born in my family, Verena, and then another sister, Hannabeth, and the third sister was born in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Chaco</span> right there in the Mennonites...there with the Mennonites. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">They had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> had brought 3 doctors who had joined the community in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and they came out with us and this doctor was there, and helped my mother in...in the time of delivering. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Other children were born there. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So I would like to say that in this whole process of fleeing for conscious sake, there were quite a few things to consider. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Pregnant mothers, little babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">These things. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I remember meeting Indians in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chaco</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">They were so-called wild Indians with loin cloth and...uh...the feathers they had in their hair, but they were all very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And as I was told, these Indians also had a type of community life. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">They...1f somebody got something, they brought it to the oldest woman in the tribe, and she would then distribute to each one as you needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">They cared for each other and helped each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And for this reason, we felt quite close to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">My father tells me that he met some of the...of the leaders of the ___, of the Indian tribe, and they gave us some <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And my father asked him, "How much do we pay?" </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And the Indian said, "One dollar.” </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And then the brothers asked shall we sign a document, the Indian said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Shake hands on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">That's enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We feel...we feel something from you which doesn't require any legal documents.” </span><span class="sentence" id="403">In the end, we decided not to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chaco</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">It was too difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">The agriculture __ was too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">It was too hot, and then this military question played also into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So then the brothers went to what is called East...<span class="REGION">east Paraguay</span> , __ <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> , and there along side some other <span class="REGION">Mennonite colonies</span> , we found a big...not an estate, a big...uh...<span class="DLF">cattle ranch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I think four thousand acres or something like that, maybe more. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And the man wanted to sell us and we bought part of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And we called it...it was called Priwara, which means Spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">So when this became clear, we all got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they drove us out on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">We got back to kilometer 144, drove to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kasaro</span> , got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and went down 2 days I think...2 days and a night, to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Protorosario</span> , which means Rosario Port, and there again Mennonites fetched us with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">horse wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">We drove 60 kilometers inland to this new <span class="NPIP">place</span> which we had acquired. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">There were no <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> on this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">It was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">It was just wild <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> ...uh...plains, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span> , and while the members of the...the men of the community start to build <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , we children stayed with the Mennonites in their <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> ...I think again for at least | or 2 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And then finally we could all move up to the <span class="BUILDING">Primiwara</span> , and start our community life again. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">As I think about the whole thing, from the sake of conscious, my parents started from scrap just about every 10 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">In <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> were scrapped and they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they started from with nothing, with the Bruderhof, and the left that, went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So and that is a difficult thing, to start with nothing, everything 10 years is quite something. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Primawara</span> , we started building <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Uh...In that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , there is a lot of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">timber</span> , so we had to get timber. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">You cut the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">You can't buy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">You cut the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> 1n the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">You bring them out what they call__, which 1s a contraption consisting of two enormous wheels 6 feet high, big wheels with an axle, pulled by 12 oxens and the log maybe 30, 50 60 feet long is balanced under this axle and the oxen pull it out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and then you cut it up by hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">You can imagine this was all a lot of work for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We built four big <span class="INT_SPACE">halls</span> , a <span class="DLF">roof</span> , no <span class="DLF">walls</span> , no <span class="DLF">interior walls</span> , and with just curtains separating the different families and there we stayed until we could build better <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">We started right away with agriculture, which 1s basically all we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">We start with <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span> , wooden tannery. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">In <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> , there's some wonderful <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , exotic <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , which make beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vases</span> , sugar bowls, candle holders, things like that which people buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So we went into <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span> and agriculture. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">We started our own <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, and I remember that there were 3 <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">It's hot in <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">It's sub-tropical country, and...uh...summer it goes up to 100, very humid. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Every day a thunderstorm, and winter it goes down to 32 degrees, 33 fahrenheit. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">There was a little bit of ice, no snow, but cold because we were not used...having hot weather all the time...to this cold weather. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">So in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priawara</span> , there were three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wood islands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">The first one...the first one we cleared and built a <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">communal kitchen</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">store house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And the second little wood which was maybe 100, maybe 200 yards away, was the <span class="BUILDING">preschool</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> (clearing throat) and in the third one we cleared...and I remember with machetes we cleared the cactus on the brush, and then we...there we built some <span class="BUILDING">school houses</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">school rooms</span> , where all the children were educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">We had our own teachers which we always wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">We...we feel that in this community life, we want to have certain values. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Values of love, peace, justice, and we...(clearing throat) we know that the teachers have to have the same values as the parents for a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to be...uh....wholeheartedly going 1n one direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">So this we had our own <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with our own teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">It was difficult, but other people died so simply by being able to live, it was a great...a great thing already. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">In <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> we stayed til 1960. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I lived there for 20 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I also lived part of my life in <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> , and also a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in <span class="REGION">South America</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montediveo</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="449">Clearing throat) While we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> , there were some revolutions. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">There're always revolutions somewhere going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And we were on the...on the <span class="DLF">battle line</span> ...uh...different parties winning and losing. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">They always asked us to help them supply <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> with horses to carry the ammunition and the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">We always refused this. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">If a soldier's hungry, we give him food. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">If he's hurt, we'll help him, but we will not take part in furthering military objectives in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And this was dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">My father, again, was...he had to meet these officers and they threatened to kill him more than once by not...by refusing to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">But I feel that by holding on to values which one has, it's the best thing we can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">If one starts compromising, it gets...one gets on slippery ground very fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  What was the government's reaction...
ANSWER:  The Paraguayan government was...is a Catholic government complete. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">The whole <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">They took us in because they needed people on the...on the land working agriculture. </span><span class="sentence" id="463"><span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> is a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which lost...I don't know exact the figures, but they had a big war with <span class="COUNTRY">Bolivia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> , and they lost enormous amount of people there, especially men and boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So they needed people to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Not business people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , but on the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And therefore the Paraguayan government gave us religious freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We were not Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">They gave us complete authority in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">No policeman had any business there. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">They gave us freedom of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ...of teaching children how we wanted, and they freed us from military service...uh...for generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And this...this was...this made us very happy that this was possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">So the government was very friendly in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And we worked hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">We started an industry of...uh...wood saw...sawing logs, and this <span class="BUILDING">tannery</span> and printing from...We worked together with a speaker, an organization from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , which helps third world countries improve cattle...uh...corn, soybeans. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Different things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">They came to us, and we had some very good agronomists amongst members, and so they had a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> on our <span class="REGION">land</span> where they experimented to improve peanuts, corn, soybeans, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So we worked with them, and that also helped us, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">In the beginning, the cow...we needed milk for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">The cows were all wild cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">They gave half a cup of milk if you were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So we needed to improve the dairy, and this took year but it got improved eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">For us children, it was actually a nice time. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">We never suffered hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We...we didn't get to eat meat, but we had bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">We had beans. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">This is fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">One doesn't need to live in big luxury to feed comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We had the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">We were cared for. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">There was a lot of sickness at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Eye diseases....uh...tropical sores, hookworm, malaria. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">All these things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">But...uh...standing together and helping each other and supporting each other made it possible to get over this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Now, the...the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was all in...in English I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I'm not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we spoke only German. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">In <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> we switched over from German and English. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">In <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> , it was German and English and then English I think and Spanish, so I grow up in three languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">That's why...that's why my spelling to this day is a little wobbly as Pooh Bear would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So we had this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, and we had 9 years of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to the 9th grade, and then I was asked with another boy...another boy from the community, to go to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , to go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> but you had to need, you need Spanish for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So he and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ascuncion</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">capitol</span> , where some other people were studying to be teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Uh...Mainly teachers actually we needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">We went there to what's called the <span class="BUILDING">Kindergrotto</span> , 5th grade, which is the...the last year of the <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">In <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> , they...I think they use a French system. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Six years primary education, six years <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and then six or seven years <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">That's how the system works. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So we were quite old,...uh...but we had to do this last year's primary education, <span class="BUILDING">kindergrotto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">We didn't know any Spanish hardly, and we had...we had a heck of a time. (</span><span class="sentence" id="509">Laughing) Even in the State-run <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , they hardly had any...any...uh...notebooks. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">No textbooks, so the teacher dictated. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I remember writing everything down as fast I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">They speak very fast, and then I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">He...my friend and I and asked help of an older man from the community who was studying to be a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">He tried to decipher what we had written down so we could learn it later. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And I stayed in this community in the...the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof house</span> as we call it for quite a number of years trying to get this education. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">This <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> served a number of functions. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">In <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> you can't just.. uh...order something and UPS brings it. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">It doesn't work like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">It doesn't work like that, so all the buying and selling went on in the <span class="BUILDING">capitol</span> and then you had to organize transport from the <span class="BUILDING">capitol</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">colony</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And especially in the beginning years, we had to buy sugar, the soap, the wheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Everything had to be bought in the <span class="BUILDING">capitol</span> and then transported to the <span class="BUILDING">colony</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">They're changing tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
ANSWER:  So this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which we had in..uh...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ascunion</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">capitol</span> , was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which we rented and later bought. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And this study was the young people studying, mainly to be teachers or going to <span class="BUILDING">secondary school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and maybe could be compared to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">We also had some people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">We had a...<span class="BUILDING">store</span> , where we sold tanned goods from the...from the community in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And we sold quite of these tanned things out of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Mainly tourists, Americans who came through brought these. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">We also made there orange juice, concentrated orange juice and sold it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And this <span class="BUILDING">capitol</span> also, all the business was transacted. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">As I said, sugar, flour, soap, matches, all the things we didn't make ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Cloth. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">All the things we didn't make ourselves had to be bought somehow and then transported up to this <span class="COUNTRY">colony</span> which we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">To get from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ascunion</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">colony</span> took about 2 days...a day, a night and a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">One night traveling with a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">river boat</span> , maybe...yeah..to _____ and then a day's travel with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">horse wagon</span> from the port to the colony...to the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">While being in..1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ascunion</span> , I remember a time of revolution which happened every now and then and there was wild shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">They have...uh...metal telephone on power poles, sheet metal and you could...they were like sieves sometimes at the end of these revolutions. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">You know the bullets going right through them. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">This all made me...made one remember the times of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , so this kind of thing went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">We...I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ascunion</span> , together with the other people for the whole <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year, because things started in January and ended maybe in October and then for the summer holidays I went back to my family in the community in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Another important thing that...that happened to us was since we had three doctors on the pharmacists and the helper on the <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> who came with us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Primaware</span> , this community in <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> , when the...when the surrounding neighbors found out that we had three doctors, they came flocking because there was not a doctor in a hundred miles circumference. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">They had no <span class="NPIP">where</span> to go with their disease and there's plenty of tropical diseases there. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Leprosy, ___, hookworms. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I tell you it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So these people all came for help. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">We...we did what we could, but also lacked help. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So very early in the game, then we sent people to <span class="REGION">North America</span> , brothers and sisters to go to visit big pharmacological places here in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and beg for medical equipment, medication, money, whatever to start to help these people down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And bit by bit we built a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I think at the highest point it had maybe 30 or 40 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">The doctors did all kinds of operations. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Uh...People came when the children were born, hookworm treatment...uh...Saturday night brawls. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">All this kind of thing came to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and we did what we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">We asked payment insofar as the people could...could pay, but I don't think we ever insisted. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">We didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">court</span> to demand payment. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">That we never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Some people paid with eggs or a pig or a cow, but we have to realize that in <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> the people living in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> are very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">They don't have any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">They have very few things. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And so we just helped basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">We just helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">But food...sending people to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ...the people coming here found other people interested in a different way of life where the rat race is cut out. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">You know running after money, spending it, having to spend it. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Day and night keeping going ...and this kind of frenzy some people didn't want anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And they were looking for a different way of life altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So when we sent people up there, they met some who were interested and they came to visit us in <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> which is very important because we were very isolated in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and we never wanted to live for ourselves, for our own edification, for our own salvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">That is not our purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Our purpose is to show everybody that people can live in peace and justice and harmony together. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">That this 1s possible right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And we are.... am not better than anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I've got the same inclinations, temptations in my heart, but the question is where do I call it... where do I say stop? </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And living in community, having this goal of love to each other...a true love which admonishes which helps. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">This kind of love is what actually every human being longs for. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And so we did never wanted to live for ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">We wanted...we hoped that we can be a witness to other people that the life and brotherhood is possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">To Catholics, to Protestants, to Jews, to Moslems, to Agnostics, to Atheists, it doesn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">To <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bums</span> to rich men. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And so when these people came from <span class="REGION">North America</span> , they asked many questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Why you do this? </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Why you this? </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And this is good for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">We need to see what we're doing also through other people eyes and...and see if we are still true to what we want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And so this was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">In 1954, I think, well we had people then in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> traveling all the time, meeting with interested people. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">There was an intentional community movement in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in the 50s, and so we visited these people and some wanted to join and some said, "You're too far away in <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Why don't you start a community up here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="587">So in 1954, we started a community in <span class="REGION">New York State</span> near...between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kingston</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poughkeepsie</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="588">There's a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Roseton</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newport</span> , and there we bought some <span class="REGION">land</span> and some <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and started <span class="BUILDING">Hutterian Bruderhof</span> where people could come and see if they were ready to join or if they wanted it all, and so this was very good. (</span><span class="sentence" id="589">Clearing throat) Now back to <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and then I went to <span class="BUILDING">University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I was training to become a doctor, a medical physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And as I said, there were different revolutions going on so when I was in first, second year in medicine, there was a big upheaval in the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and South American altogether and also in <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">The students are active social movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">They...the young people protest injustice, the political oppression. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And so the students were always in a... in a revolt, you know, in a stir, in a commotion, asking for justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">But one day the police came and closed the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> down because the government didn't like this social upheaval. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">They called it communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And...uh...so the closed the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> down and the Brother decided that I should go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montediveo</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> to continue with the studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And so I went down there and finished up later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> , the little community called there called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eldorado</span> , about 10 miles out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montediveo</span> , where the...where we started another little community. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">It started just with a few people working in a <span class="DLF">dairy farm</span> and then we felt it's better not to be employed, but really start a community so we did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">We bought, I think, maybe 20, 30 acres with some <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">We sent families down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Because we wanted to be near..near a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where people...where we could talk to people and meet people. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">We didn't want to live for ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ascunion</span> , we didn't find enough <span class="NPIP">places</span> for the young people to be educated in different things, and so this community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elarado</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montediveo</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> was supposed to be another center for young people to go to and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Maybe I should say at this point that in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> we, the children born into the community are not members. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">There's no automatic birthright membership. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">The young people they are born there. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">They grow up and we try to give them as good education as we can which varies. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">In <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> it was very limited. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Here in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , we're very grateful for the education into <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> which is free of charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">But this wasn't so in <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> , so...so these children as they grow up, they...they get educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">They get to know what this community life is all about, but then we're very interested to let them experience how other people live so they can come to a decision seeing both sides of the picture, so to say, and come to a personal decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">If you want to join in the <span class="BUILDING">Bruderhof</span> , it cannot be for..for the parents’ sake. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">It cannot be for brothers and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">It can't be for a good life which we now have. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">We have a good life now. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">It can't be for any kind of...uh...comfort. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">It can only be for the sake to show the people can live together. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And we found that 1f we do what Jesus said, it happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Now, I want to go back to the time in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">When my father and I and a group of others visited <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1985, we knew that the question of the Holocaust wold come up and there our Jewish friends asked, "What do you think of the Holocaust?" </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And my father answered after a moment of silence...I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">He said, "The Holocaust is a judgment on the Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Because (clearing throat) all the Germans who did the killing were nominal Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Catholics and Protestants. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And I know that Jesus did not say kill your enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">He didn't even say kill the handicapped. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">He didn't say kill the imbecile, the mentally handicapped. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">He said love your fellowman which is told in the Tennah by God himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So this...this love is what we need, and so therefore we said in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz Hasara</span> in 85, "It is a judgment on the Christians because they did not do what they said they were.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="634">Clearing throat) And then my father went on to say, "But if we Christians and you Jews don't take a lesson, don't learn from this Holocaust experience, the Holocaust will come that takes all of us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And I think the present day world situation is just about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">QUESTION:  Have you been back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I went back in 88 once. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">We had gone again to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , invited by the kibbutz movement to visit them. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">We stayed there 3 weeks and then back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And I remember going to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> there and I had all these memories coming back from 1937. (</span><span class="sentence" id="642">Crying) So I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">We have a little...I hope it doesn't matter if I skip around a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">So this was the answer my father gave about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Now for the last few...since | year we have started a community in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> again in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bernba</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> , in the ___. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And we went to this...we went to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we bought a property which used to belong to the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic CHurch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">It was a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">It was very well suited to community life. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">It had plans for three or four more big <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , community-type <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And so we bought this property and then a resistance developed from the inhabitants of this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bernba</span> , 400 people maybe, which was so...uh...strong against us coming and against us extending that a Lutheran...Angelical minister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bernba</span> said publicly in a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , "Have we forgotten what happened 50 years ago? </span><span class="sentence" id="651">That we are so antagonistic and hateful to people who are not fit into our system?" </span><span class="sentence" id="652">She was referring to 1937...uh...to the whole Nazi time where foreigners, Jews...uh...second class citizens were simply hated and exterminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">She...she said, "Is...are we there again? </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Have we not learned?" </span><span class="sentence" id="655">There was a real confrontation there and we..we don't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">We invite the neighbors to come and see and talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">We sing together, but there 1s a real little circle there that wants to get us out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bernba</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">This caused an uproar in the newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Television companies came and made, you know, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">televisions</span> and...uh...programs which were broadcast all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So we think again this attack on us in the end served something good. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">People hear about the brotherly way of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  Is the community still in existence?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we are still holding on. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">We don't know how to go, but we're still holding on. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">We have no permission to build. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">We have no...we can't do a thing because the village authority hasn't given permission yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">But we hope it will mellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">We heard that the place we bought in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bernba</span> was a real Nazi center for Nazi, you know, so maybe their spirit 1s still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Personally, I don't think that the Nazi spirit or this hate spirit can be eliminated by killing the people who represent it. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I heard that Cohan was killed...murdered yesterday or two days ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And he was...he was very right wing and...and hateful to other people, but I don't think killing him kills the spirit he was serving. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And this 1s...this 1s what we think all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And it...on the ____ Bruderhof, I remember that the brotherhood which we called the Committed Members, they wrote letters to Hitler, to Goring, to the Gestapo, to the Nazi officials in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassel</span> , stating our situation very clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">We respect the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">We are not intending to overcome it with violence, but we can have nothing to do with certain values they uphold. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So we want to love the enemy, but without killing him, without hurting him. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">This is...this is what we aim for. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">But this 1s a struggle for every person. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I...I can be committed to a goal, but it still is harder for me to work towards, because I'm just a humanbeing. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So here I digressed a little. (</span><span class="sentence" id="682">Clearing throat) Now, let me think a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So we started a community in the...1n <span class="REGION">North America</span> and we...(clearing throat) in 1960, then we decided to close down all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paraguayan communities</span> and all come up to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="684">We went through a difficult time in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> which I maybe can explain best by saying our Hutterian forefathers from the 16th Century compare a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> to a lantern, a glass lantern with a candle in the middle like they used to have. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And the community is a lantern, but the important thing in the lantern is the light in the lantern. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">The lantern serves only to let the light shine out. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And this light for us is Jesus as love, justice and unity. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">That is the light. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And we lost this light. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And...uh..(clearing throat) so the things that destroy community life---self-will, selfishness, egotism, huddling, back biting--all these things that destroy community life came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And in 1960, we went through a time where we (clearing throat) everyone was faced with the question what do I want with my life? </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Do I want to serve love or do I want to serve myself? </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And on this then (clearing throat) a large number left us. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And the rest we came together in <span class="REGION">North America</span> here, and then we started the community in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> , <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> and that's the northwestern corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And we were...we bought an old <span class="NPIP">place</span> ...it is a <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">We don't like <span class="BUILDING">castles</span> , but this was a place where a hundred people could find <span class="BUILDING">lodging</span> right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And so we bought this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and 50 acres and in a feel for different groups, we moved up from <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> to <span class="REGION">North America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Because we needed to...together to find the way to work for the values we had set. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And as humanbeings, we have goals but we always liable to...to move either to the left or to the right and lose the way, but we are determined to find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And so that's why we came together in <span class="REGION">North America</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">While in <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> , I met my future wife, Elana. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">She was there studying music. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">She's part...she's a daughter of the family of the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">She came down to study music, and we got engaged down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And we were engaged for 3 years, because it was in this...this whole time that we closed one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> after the other and moved up to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> so there was no time for a marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">But when she came up in January 1962...1 came up in November 1961...(clearing throat) we decided to marry. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And when I say we, I mean my wife and I and the whole community because all such actions are take...the decisions are made together. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And so we married in June... 24th of June 1962. (</span><span class="sentence" id="709">Clearing Throat) We had a...1t was a wonderful occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Then we had two children in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> and then we were asked to move to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> which had also started. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Maybe I should say here that (clearing throat) when we decide free willing...when I decide free willingly to become a member of this community, I declare my readiness to serve wherever it's needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">So I can work in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> making toys for children. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I could clean <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I could work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Where...wherever I'm needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I don't want to fulfill my gifts specially. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I'm here to serve. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And so in this sense my family moved to the Pennsylvania community, and I worked there in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And then in 1972, we moved again to the Connecticut community 1973 to be with my father, my mother, and the parents of my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">They were getting older. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">My father-in-law,_____———s and so we... we came together to support them as children in this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">So now, what else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">QUESTION:  I guess if that's the end of it, that's the end of this tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  I think that's the end of the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I would like to say that we are very eager to meet people from all kinds of backgrounds, to talk, to exchange and...and to see if maybe they also free willingly would like to join with us to give this witness of brotherhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">That is the purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">QUESTION:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Conclusion of Interview </span>
