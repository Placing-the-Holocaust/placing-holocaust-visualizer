</span><span class="sentence" id="462">They’re more civilized than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">They’re not going to do these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">They’re not going to kill.” </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And as soon as the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped it became like a terrible wind. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And they separated us, the women this way and the men that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Didn’t see my father anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Didn’t see my sister, she was next to me, but she wouldn’t part with her children, so you pulled her out on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">So, I ran out from my <span class="NPIP">side</span> and I went to see... to be with my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And the SS, they had canes. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">They took the cane and put around my neck and pulled me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">They pulled me back to that <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So, I ran again over to my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I think I was scared, I didn’t know which way. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I wanted to be with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So he took me out for the second time and he opened up my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Hit me with the cane over the head and that was the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I never saw them afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So, when you come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , you had to get undressed and of course, I started to cry very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I wanted to go to my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I didn’t tell them what, what I was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And an SS woman comes over to me and she says to me, “Why are you crying?” </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Disoriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Everything... it was unbelievable what they could put people in. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And she says to me, “Why are you crying?” </span><span class="sentence" id="486">So I said to her, “I want to go back to my sister.” </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And she said, “You are going to see her tomorrow.” </span><span class="sentence" id="488">She was a good one. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And then another SS woman came over, said, “Why are you crying?” </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I cried harder. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I said, “Because I want to go to your sister... to my sister.” </span><span class="sentence" id="492">She said, “You'll never see her again.” </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And since that point, I never cried again. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Because first they, they cut your hair, and then they tattooed, and my hand got swollen like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And lonesome, you have nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I was really transport from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but they were no, not related to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And I had nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And the following day when they took us to work, we saw the smoke coming out of the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> and I put two and two together and I knew exactly what was going on, that they not around anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">That’s exactly how it was.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  So you, did you talk together about what was going on there and try to figure out...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  We all knew the same things. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">You couldn’t figure out anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">You couldn’t escape as far as this is concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">You had to listen, and you had to be strong, and you had to help one another the best you were able to. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And that’s exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I was always helping and one day, one morning... 1t was called the <span class="DLF">block</span> , the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you were staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And every day somebody else had to go to get coffee in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And... two people, because it looked like 12 a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage barrel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">With two and you had to carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And that morning was my, my turn to go to get the coffee in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And sure enough I went and the other girl went and from nowhere a girl came along and she had a, a plate like a... you know, like a...

<p><span class="sentence" id="664">QUESTION:  Will you tell me about, what your experience was with them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">ANSWER:  I had very bad experience with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Like I said, we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> and the first thing in the morning, after they, of course, cut my hair, put the number on and did everything else what they had to, separated us, of course, from the loved ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And six o’clock in the morning or five o’clock in the morning, these four people from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , they came before us. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And they were real meanies. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">They had nothing nice about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And the first thing out of their mouth at six o’clock in the morning was “Polska koovi stavach (ph).” </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I... 1, the first time in my life, by that point, I heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">It meant, to explain it, “Polish whores, get up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And I was so bewildered with that saying, because I didn’t know even what a whore meant at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And that was my first greeting with the Kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And from then on, like I said, there was nobody that told you, but you figured out already what’s going on and, and that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">You cannot go under their nails, you cannot ask for anything, because you’re not going to get it and you have to obey. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">You have to leave at a certain time your <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and then that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">You couldn’t stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">To remain on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Never, because they would gas you right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And like I said, luck was with me, I don’t know if it’s luck, or... I always said, that through my life, through my stories I always feel that somebody carries on with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Or whatever it happens in life, that somebody 15 carries on with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">It’s God will. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I shouldn’t have gotten off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Had I gotten off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , they would have taken me immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">But like I said, my brain told me, you’ll never make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And don’t get undressed and don’t go through him. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And I remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And like I said before, I was in the <span class="BUILDING">Revier</span> after a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And of course they didn’t treat me, but at least I had the chance to... not to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And then I got a better job. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">So the woman that took care on me, she was a Polish woman—not took care, but she spoke to me, let’s put it this way—on the <span class="BUILDING">Revier</span> , was a very nice person. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">So one day I approached her after being there maybe three or four months. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So I, I asked her if... she used to come in the morning, she was wearing a white coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And she was clean and she had a short hair cut. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">She was really pretty woman.</span></p>

I don’t know what they did with it afterwards, but that’s what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And that’s what I was working for. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And this helped me, too, not to get <span class="NPIP">outside</span> with my leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And of course, it healed by now, but I... 1t left me a terrible scar. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">It... it grew like wild flesh on it, but I was happy that I could walk on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And that’s what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">When I came out of there, when people saw me that they knew me, they didn’t believe that I’m alive, because months I was not with them.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1052">ANSWER:  I always felt, this I told my friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> also, that this was my mother’s and my father’s last wish, that somebody has to remain from the family and carry on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And I was the one to survive and that’s what I have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I have to build back what we lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">That’s the way I lived after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">But of course, it’s just like a, like a made up story, but it’s, this helped me a lot in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Like I’m not doing it, but somebody else tells me to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1058">QUESTION:  That was what kept you going in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1059">ANSWER:  That’s what kept me going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">My friend told me that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">Halina, the one from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">There was a time in my life when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , I’m going way ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">This was after the war and we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And the Americans liberated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And each of us from the nine girls that there were, had family in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">I had an uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">This one had a sister and this one had in <span class="REGION">South America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Every one of us had family and they advised us that we shouldn’t go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">They asked us, what do we want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">And we said, we want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to look for the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">And they advised us not to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , because at that point already everything was shared up already, what belongs to whom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> belonged to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And they told us not to go, because we’ll never get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">So, the only thing they advised, 23 advised us, excuse me, is we should go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">So, the Americans, the ones that liberated, advised us not to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , uh, not to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">We should go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , from there the organizations will take over and we’ll find our family and then we’ll be able to get to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">So that’s exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">They gave us a paper and they put us on, because we had no clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">So, they gave us a paper, and they gave us uniforms that the WACs wore and they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And we were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Switau</span> , from the Czechs, we were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And on the way they took us off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> one stop and they said that we shouldn’t talk to them, we should just give them the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And sure enough on the, the next stop they put us back on and we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">And there Rothschild gave us, it was a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And they gave us the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for the misplaced people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">And that’s what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">We slept two ina <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and downstairs was a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">So, and we used to be able to come down and eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">Now, I don’t remember how long I was there, but I just couldn’t go down with a dish again and eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">So, I cried so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">But it was more tears in the dish than it was food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">And I decide I’m going to cook for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">And each <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , they had like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">two burner</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">So, that’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">I bought some potatoes and that’s what I used to cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">But of course, there was like a <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">You know, you had to wait quite a while, but it was for me better not to go downstairs, but to cook and eat for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">And so, that’s where I got in with my friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">I slept with Halina, with my girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">My cousin and another friend was in the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">We were... we had nine <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , one after the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">And at one point practically everybody found their family already and they were leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And of course, me, I didn’t find my family, didn’t find my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And the only thing 1s, I said to myself and I said to them too, either he’s very rich, he doesn’t want to identify himself, or he died, one of the two, so many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">So...

<p><span class="sentence" id="1117">ANSWER:  The sleeping conditions were practically the same, but the only thing is, there we already had water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">You could wash yourself whenever you wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">And of course the food was the same, but we didn’t have the...

separated, that we should all remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">And that’s what happened, the address I forgot where he lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">And that’s what it was so hard for him to find me, for me to find him, rather. </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">And the papers that he read, there was a lot of Jewish papers them years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">So, instead of The Day they called it, you read Good Morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">So, I put it in this paper

class="sentence" id="1737">And that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">And two days later or three days later, I get a letter, my uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">And he sent

should come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">And that’s the way it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">So, in the interim I, I sent him a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">That I was mad, because I took it very wrong that he doesn’t want to acknowledge himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">This was my pride, but it was not so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">He was very, you know, devoted and healthy, happy that I’m alive, that somebody’s alive from the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">And interested, very, I should come and he’Il try to help in every way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">And that he’s sending out papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">But then from there instead of sending me letters, they sent me telegrams. </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">And they bought me already the, the, everything, they paid the fare in for me to go by

class="sentence" id="1758">And when he told me that... yeah, a picture came from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1759">And he was in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">Because I wrote them, “I never got a picture, I never got a letter, I don’t understand what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">You don’t keep your promise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">I’m not going to keep my promise.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">You know, that’s the way I was talking to my... writing to my friends.</span></p>
