<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Are you rooting for the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , or <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Well, I think I would like to see <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> win. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I like the acupuncture idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Ah, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Okay, this is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. Paul Pressman. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">It’s July the eighth, 1999 and we are sitting in Dr. Pressman’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lexington</span> , <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> , and this is Arwen Donahue conducting the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">This is tape number one, side A. Let’s begin then with, would you tell me something about your, well first of all, let’s begin with where you were born and your date of birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , May 29, 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I did my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , my <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , also. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And I stay until the first World War and when the German came. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And by the time probably I was around nine years old, and the Germans start to come in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but first it was the French police who came, just asking every teacher, “Do you have any Jewish boy in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And she said or he said, “I don’t know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So they ask, “Who is Jewish, raise your hand.” </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And I didn’t raise my hand and when I did go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I said to my mother and father, well, this is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And they sent me in a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> in South of France.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  How did you know not to raise your hand? </span><span class="sentence" id="19">What made you not do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  I think it was personal instinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I thought, you know, you can ask, “Are you French? </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Would you like to stay and live in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="23">But the question “Are you Jewish?” </span><span class="sentence" id="24">was a little bit surprising for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Why should people ask what kind of religion, mostly we knew it was the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So, I didn’t feel comfortable, so I said, I’m going to wait a little bit and speak to my parent and ask them what they think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Had you been aware at all at that time, that there was any danger to Jews posed by the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Oh yes, I, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , they start to prepare a big <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to put a lot of people, belonging to a certain religion, so I knew something was going on, but , you know, at my age, when I was nine or ten years old, it is not, it’s not like a game, but it’s not very serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But I knew they’d been taking Jew in other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">1</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What was your name at birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  The same name I got now, Paul Pressman, PRESSMAN.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Do you know anything about the name Pressman? </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Is that where your family came from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  Mine parent are both born in, at the time 1t was <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It was <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , became Russian, then became <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And all of my family, I don’t know any of them, but come from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">The name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kishinev</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bessarabia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  When did they come to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  They got married in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and they came, I remember my father saying, at the time they arrive in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , my mother was sixteen or seventeen. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And they try first to come in <span class="COUNTRY">United State</span> , but they didn’t let them in <span class="COUNTRY">United State</span> , because my mother did have glaucoma. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And they didn’t know what was glaucoma at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">They thought it was a very dangerous sickness, so she did go back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , stay in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> a little while and establish in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And this is where I was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  What was your, what were your parents’ names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  My mother is Pauline Kogan, K O J AN! </span><span class="sentence" id="46">and my father was Joseph Pressman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  And did you have brothers or sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  I did have three brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I’m the youngest one. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">The other brother, both of them did work with my father in a <span class="BUILDING">drapery factory</span> he did open. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">The other one, at the time didn’t work, he was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And I was the smallest, the little one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  What were your, what was your oldest brother and your middle brother’s names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  The oldest brother, who survived the Holocaust, name is Bernard and the other one, who died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was Maurice. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">The other one, the third one is Gaston, and I am Paul.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  And Gaston survived as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Yes, because he was sent with me in a safe <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , because at the time <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was cut in two parts, north and south. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And the south was with the Italian and it was much easier there. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">It didn’t stay long, but by the time the Italian were there, it was much easier than in north, where the Germans were much more rough with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  Did your mother work? ' </span><span class="sentence" id="61">The “J” is probably a misstated “G”. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">2</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Before the war, yes, she was working with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">She was working a sewing machine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Havre</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> in Havre (ph), in the business of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And until the end, she was working with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  And she stopped when the war began?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Well, she stopped when the French police, under the order of the German came to pick up my two brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And my two brother did follow the police with no resistance, because they, you know, the police said it is just to make a verification of your paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And they didn’t ask anything about my father, but he right away closed the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And we had been waiting about the answer, but my two brother never came back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Can you just tell me something about your childhood, your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="71">What stands out in your memory from that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  Well, we used to have a nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , close to the business of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And also about fifteen miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , we did have a little <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> , where we used to go on Saturday and Sunday and stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Life was very simple, happy, didn’t have any major problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">They used to work during the week. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I used to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Saturday... Friday night, we load the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , we did go and stay outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And everything was fine and dandy. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So, life was normal, until the whole German story start and then everything change overnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  Were your parents religious at all? </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  My mother was very religious, but my father was not religious at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So, he ask me one day, I remember, he said, “Do you want to do your Bar Mitzvah?” </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And I said, “No, I don’t want to.” </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Okay, no Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And it was the end of the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">My brothers never did a Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">He was really not very interested in, not only in the Jewish religion, but on any religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">This 1s, I think, the way Iam now. [</span><span class="sentence" id="90">Laughing]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Was it hard for your mother that you, that you and your brothers weren’t being raised more religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I think it was hard for her and this is why she asked us, the day she’s going to die, she wants to be buried with the Jewish religion, which we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">At the time, I did have an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And when she died, we made... the rabbi did the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We didn’t understand anything about it, because it was the first Jewish funeral we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But here she is in south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , in a <span class="NPIP">Jewish place</span> , where she was buried like the Jewish religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  Do you remember... I assume you, were you going to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Do you remember when the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Do you remember them coming in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  In <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They came very, not in force. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They came very, very slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">The reason, I think, they got the whole thing so easy is because the French people are very anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So, for them 3 to give the address or to reveal where the Jew were living, it was not a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And I don’t mean to say all of them, because a lot of police... we did have a neighbor, across from our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , who was from the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And I even remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">His name was Mr. Reddler (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And every time something did happen, he came in our <span class="DLF">door</span> , knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and said, “Be careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">They’re going to do this, they’re going to do this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So, I don’t mean to say all the Frenchmen, but I said at least the majority of the French people were anti-Semitic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Did you have any sense, up to that point, of being a Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Had you personally experienced any anti-Semitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  All the time, even when I was a little boy I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and you can see on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , Jew equal concentration camp, Jew go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , Jew go home, things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Yes, you couldn’t do otherwise than to realize, okay, we are not welcome in our own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">When I say our own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I’m born in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , so I thought I was a Frenchman, which was a big mistake, because no. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">It’s a little bit the same problem and I don’t want to start any...</p>
<p>QUESTION:  It’s okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  It’s the, my feeling... I speak with a lot of black people here and I ask them why do you call yourself, African-American? </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I don’t say to people, I am a French-American. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I’m an American, because I asked to become an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">If I would call myself French-American, it would mean to say, I’m very happy to be French and I’m also happy to be an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And I think in life, you have to make a choice, either you are an American or you’re French. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And if it wouldn’t be... I say this the other day to a black guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">He was very surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And coming from me, I think it was not a big problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But I said, “I think you’re very lucky, your grand-grandparent was brought in <span class="COUNTRY">United State</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">At least now you can drive a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">You can have a nice <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , instead of being in <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> where you’d be starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">You wouldn’t have any clothes to put on your back and anybody can kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And this for me is racism. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Here racism 1s not this. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">They are not racist, so I don’t understand why you call yourself African-American. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">You are American from two, three or four generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And it’s not because your parents were slave.” </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And when you know the story about the slave, it’s not the American who took the black people. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It’s the chief of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , who give black people to the American. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So...</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What kind of response did you get?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  Most of the time they said, “Well it’s a way of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">You have a different way of speaking.” </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And I said, “You know, I, as a Jewish person cannot be a racist. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So, if I tell you this, it’s because coming from another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I’m surprised the way you deal with your slave story. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">You feel sorry for yourself, but you’re so lucky to be in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where you have freedom and you can live like any other person. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">You’re Black? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Sure it’s, you can see a black man, but sometimes you can recognize a Jewish boy and so it’s nothing worse to be Black or to be Jew, but I don’t want to fight the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for this.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  You don’t think that Jews can be racist, too? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">4</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Oh yeah, oh yeah, Jewish people can be very, very racist. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I saw this on many different occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But it’s not the same kind of racism they have. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">It’s a... I don’t know any Jew belonging to the KKK.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  They wouldn’t probably accept them. [</span><span class="sentence" id="153">Laughing]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Absolutely, so I don’t think... but it’s, it make a... Man is man, woman 1s woman, people are people. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And you can find people, different idea of people, different approach of life and so I think, yes, it can be a lot of, some Jewish people can be racist. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">It doesn’t make a... but before we have to define: what do they mean by being racist?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  What do you think that means?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  Well, racism is something, it’s hate with no reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">You like some people, you like some people living in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">You like some people living in another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">You don’t like people the way they live, this can be racism. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">But basically, it’s not racism, it’s something, because you don’t like their way of laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Black people are very exuberant and maybe some American don’t like this and this can be a form of racism. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And like I said before, Jewish people living in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> are much more American than they are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And because of this, they can be racist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  I don’t understand that last. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Because they’re Jewish people living in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , they can be racist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Because they feel very safe in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And like I told you before, Jewish people are Jewish by tradition, but they belong to a minority. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And if you are in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or in United State or any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United State</span> or any country in the world, you still are minority. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">But it is so comfortable in United State, then Jewish people forget the background and say, “But I’m an American.” </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And I say, “No, first you are Jew, and if anybody is going to kill you, they’re going to kill you, just because you are Jew, not because you’re an American.” </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And this is the big problem and they lose the identity of being Jewish, just because they feel so comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">They feel, /t’s my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Yes it is, in one way. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But until, and you can see this on TV, this young man, who been speaking about racism against black, Jew, all the Jew have the power in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">It’s not true, but in his mind it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And he killed people and he killed himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">You saw this on TV two or three days ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">This is the big problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Let’s go back a little bit to, you were just telling me before about your experience as a child in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and the anti-Semitism that you experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Did you have, were all of your friends Jewish at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  At the time I didn’t have a lot of friends, because I was, I did a big selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I’m not the kind of man who have a lot of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And yes, at the time all my friends, at the time were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">The reason 1s, I feel more comfortable with Jewish people than with non-Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And again, I don’t speak about religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I speak about tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Going to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish restaurant</span> once in a while, it’s fun and it remind me memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Watching a movie with Jewish song, it’s fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I’ve been married twice with non-Jewish woman and I was missing this exchange of jokes, Jewish jokes or word. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , when I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , people speak a lot of Jewish word and it’s always funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And I always say, “Are you Jewish?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="193">No, but we use a lot of Jewish word here 5 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ,” but they are not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">But it’s funny, I like it, because it’s something... So when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , I didn’t want to have non-Jewish friend because I would never know if the same guy 1s not going to give me a knife when the time comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  You really felt that at a very early age?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  Yes, uh huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I don’t find a lot of people I can speak Yiddish with, because most of the Jewish people here, don’t speak Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But my grandson, which is the son of my daughter, and my daughter doesn’t follow the religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But my grandson studied the Jewish story, I mean the difference between Sepharad and Ashkenazi and he said, “But sometime they are racist between...” And I said, “Yes, I know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I think if you put two men with no religion on an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , there’s going to be racism, because man is stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">They want to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">They want to fight for a reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">The reason is religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And they are going to fight about God, it’s my God, it’s not your God. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">God is God. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Your God is my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">There is only one God. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">But we don’t want this, this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  Going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , you were talking a little bit earlier about the time when your two brothers were called in and they were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Do you remember around when that was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">ANSWER:  It was March in 1942, when they did go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Before it was a camp a little bit outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> , where all the Jewish people been put together for a length of time, I think it was between eight and ten month. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Where they start to shape the whole thing: “Are we going to send them? </span><span class="sentence" id="228">What kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> are we going to use?” </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It was another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> not far from there, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Compiegne</span> , which was also the same kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So... there is a man, who came here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lexington</span> , a Jewish man, who gave something... I’ve got something, I will remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And he explained what the German did have in mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And it’s amazing the way they did organize the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Even it was a lot of Jewish people, put together in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , they didn’t know nothing, from where they come, what they going to do, where they going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">6 Everything was real on paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">The train company didn’t know what they were going to transport, because it was special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So, it was so well organized, and they prepared all this and from each <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> it was the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">From <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> it was another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">From <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> it was another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">From <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> it was another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">It was really a technique they did have. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And the top of those guys, I’m afraid to say he was a brain, because he was crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">But his name was Himmler, and he organized the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And he organized this very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And you know, the Jewish people who’ve been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , most of them were, what we call here blue-collar, simple people. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">They didn’t think we’re going to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Even until they arrive in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , when they say, the SS was on, say, one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , “You go this way, you go this way.” </span><span class="sentence" id="247">No, it was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">The only time my brother realized he was in a bad direction 1s when one time, coming down from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , he didn’t go fast enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">The SS slapped his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And he was nineteen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Then he realized something is going to happen, now it’s another world. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">But until then, well 1t was hard, they didn’t have anything to eat in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">They didn’t have any water. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">They didn’t have any... but it’s going to clear up, no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They didn’t realize they go to the butcher. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They go to die, by thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And this was the life. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">They did go, because the only one who realize what’s going on were the educated people, the attorney, the doctor, the people who did study. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">But they were not many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">When my brother was deported in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , it was a guy with him, who was, I think he was a colonel in the French army. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And he said, “They are going to do nothing to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I’m a colonel from the French army.” </span><span class="sentence" id="263">He died like all the one, just because he was Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">That’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">They didn’t care he was a colonel. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">He did have a high education. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Doesn’t make any difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">You are Jew, you must die. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">It’s amazing, eh? </span><span class="sentence" id="270">But...</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you and your family have any contact with your brothers while they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  Yes, we did have the possibility to go around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , Private Honor (ph) from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haus</span> (ph) let us in and we could communicate by sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So we can see they are alive, because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> they didn’t kill anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">They been starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">They even allowed to receive some package of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">But like I said, 1t was not a long time, but communicate mouth to mouth? </span><span class="sentence" id="276">No, it was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">No German in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> just the French military and the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">No SS, no German, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was under the surveillance of the French police.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  Were your parents surprised about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  It’s very hard for me to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">It’s very hard, because like I said, I was eight, nine year. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">No, I have a hard time to remember the reaction of my father, the reaction of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">No, I don’t have any recollection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  Do remember any talk about the political situation at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  Well, you have to remember, my parent were not very high educated people. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">My mother did barely write. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">She spoke mostly the language, but she didn’t speak the... but 1t was, it was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">You have to remember my parent left <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> because of the Bolshevism. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">My parent were three hundred percent for the idea of communism. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So, they were with one track mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So politically, even if I could remember, I don’t think it would be accurate, because they were too much in one way. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I couldn’t have any discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Even my brother, who is alive now, I can, 7 some conversation about politic I cannot have with him, because he is still in one track. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Very hard to discuss about politic. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And again, like I said before, <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> is his <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">It’s the best <span class="NPIP">place</span> , why should I go in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="297">End of Tape 1, Side A 8 Tape 1, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is tape number one, side B of an interview with Doctor Paul Pressman. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Do you, how, did your parents tell you at all, when they were making plans to escape to the South of France? </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Was there any discussion with you about that or did it just happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  No, they, my parent, neither my mother, neither my father, didn’t discuss with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We’d been raised with a lot of authority from my folks. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And they say, “This is an emergency; we have to go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So my father is going to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We are going to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And we’ll see how it is going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And we’ll decide day by day, because it was no other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">We have to leave everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Everything we got lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We left with too little luggage and that’s it, because we knew we never going to see anything we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Because it was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We try to save our life, that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So another time for me and like my two other brother were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> , so it was only another brother and me, so it was a little bit easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So, my father left with my other brother, Gaston, and I stay with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And at the time it was, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> became very, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">No <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide, so my mother send me through the Zone. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">It was a <span class="DLF">line</span> between the North and South and you have to pass the <span class="REGION">Zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And some French people for money, they direct you between the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And I did go in South in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And when I arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> , a friend of my mother took me and three days later she came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And we stay... and I don’t remember how long, maybe couple months, three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And it became very dangerous to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So, she send me to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And where my father was, was more dangerous than there, so they decide... I came back to see my mother and my mother, remember I was nine years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So, they decide to send me to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> with a group of Jewish people, boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And I think I was the oldest one from all the boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">We were about fourteen, fifteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">So, we did go in one little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , just to the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> , slept there until midnight, one o’clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Then two men took us, make us walk and we arrive on the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">The Swiss took us and put us in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">refugee camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">QUESTION:  Did you leave to go to the South of France immediately, was that before your brothers had been deported for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">ANSWER:  No after, right after, because it was very, they realized now that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">If we don’t do something, they are going to take us and we’re going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So, probably my parents said, let’s save there two boys and we’ll see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  Did you know anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">No, we didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">No, I don’t think I knew something. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">We knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> because I did go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drancy</span> with my mother just to see from far away my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">But we didn’t know anything about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where they burn cadaver, where they put them in a <span class="INT_SPACE">chamber</span> and put gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">We didn’t know all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  Do you remember from that time any restrictions starting to be imposed on you as a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  Oh, the first restriction was to carry the yellow badge. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">We did have a yellow star, the Jewish star, with inside “Jew” and you have to carry this in anything you wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">So, you did have two way, either you don’t carry this thing and if they catch you, they kill you right there, or if you 9 have one, everybody can see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And this was only in the north of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So this is why my mother decided to let us go down in south, because it was, I remember when they start to give us this yellow badge to carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">In the <span class="DLF">street</span> I used to live, it was a man, who was very old, maybe eighty-five, ninety and he was blind, Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And he carried this yellow thing and I thought to myself, this is terrible, because if you can treat a human being, because of religion, it’s really the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And this 1s, I think where my mother decided to send me, because, you know, it’s so easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">It’s very hard to explain how does it look. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">How do you realize a <span class="DLF">park</span> , like here, Rupp Arena, downtown, with all the <span class="DLF">door</span> closed, only one open and you push all the Jew <span class="NPIP">inside</span> <span class="BUILDING">Rupp Arena</span> , downtown, with all the door closed, only one open and you push all the Jew inside. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And it was, I don’t know, maybe five hundred thousand, six hundred thousand. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I don’t know... all there. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And from there, they start to spread group. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And this was the beginning of the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So, it was time to do something, leave, hide and this is where I think they organized this, my mother and my father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  Did they have any connections with any resistance organizations at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER:  I found out my mother was a captain from the French army. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Since when, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> , this is where I realized what she was doing, because I never saw my mother with a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And one day, she did have a big book, she always carry with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And I said, why do you carry this book? </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And she said, well, I will show you, but you forget about what you are going to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">She opened the book and it was cut and it was a gun <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Because she used to bring food to Resistance who had been caught and put into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And she survived the whole thing, because she die after the war, with... So, yes she belonged to a group, but...</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Was it, when you say French army, what exactly do you mean?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="764">QUESTION:  Mushrooms?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">ANSWER:  Mushrooms. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">He took me to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , days, to say this one is not good, this one is good. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Took the good one, brought it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , cook them, make a meal with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I didn’t know all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I didn’t have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And it was very good for me, because it was a foundation of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And every time up to this day, I think all the time about what they did to me as a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And I became a man because of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And this is why, all the time, even like I said, I did go see them last, between ‘98 and ‘99, Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And I couldn’t find them, they moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I called everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">But otherwise, every time I go to Europe, I go see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">We spend beautiful time, quality time, even if we don’t speak together, he is the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And she is the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">In my mind, she is the most beautiful woman I met in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">She, the last time I saw her I think she was seventy-two and I think she was as beautiful as she was when I was a little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And he is the stronger man. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">It was really something. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">For me, it was a big chance to meet those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And like I said, when I did go back and I found my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I said, “The first thing we can do, as soon as we get a little bit money, I want for you to meet.” </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And I think it was one year later, I bought a used <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I took my mother and we did go see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And they were very happy and I was very happy to see them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And like I said, I always, any chance that I did have to go, I did go see them, because I felt this... we were not family, but 1t was more than family. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">It was a good, a good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">It’s a good memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">QUESTION:  Do you ever think about the irony of that...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Oh, gosh. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Life is irony, the whole life. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">When.... you know, when you become old, older than younger, life is an irony. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Why this happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="797">What is the purpose of life? </span><span class="sentence" id="798">What is the reason of life? </span><span class="sentence" id="799">We don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">But I think everything is written, you in your life, another one in another life, everything is written. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I say since a long time, we all have a ticket in the pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">18 You have the date of birth and there is no date where you’re going to go, to be gone, but really there is one, but you don’t know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And it’s funny, because I say to a lot of my patients, we celebrate birth of people, but we don’t celebrate death and death is something of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">It’s the end of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">If you did have a bad life, you’re going to have a bad time to re-incarnate in a good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">But if you look your life and you said yes, I did have bad time like everybody else, but the good time were good. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And when I remember all this, all the good time, it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">It’s experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And in life, you cannot have all the time, good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And on top of this, I say this too, some of my good patient with whom I have a good exchange, money is important, but compared to destiny, money is nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Destiny is what is going to make you what you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">You are going to be able to enjoy anything: a fruit, a good meal, good company. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And when I say good company, feeling you are with somebody, friends, and you are on the same level. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">You can exchange... if you say something a little bit different, people are not going to laugh. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">They are going to say either “What do you mean by this?” </span><span class="sentence" id="816">or they’re going to say, “I know what you mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">I feel it, what you feel.” </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And this is the purpose of life, but it’s not every day you find things like this and it’s not every day you are in tune with things. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">But when you are, it’s wonderful and the rest, well, you have to do with. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">You receive a bad bill, you have a bad problem, you have a flat tire in the middle of nowhere... it’s tough, but you have to deal with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">You say, okay, I will remember next time I’m going to have a good time, this flat tire. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">It was bad, but in exchange look what good time I got now. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And I think it’s a good philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="824">QUESTION:  As far as the idea of destiny, do you apply that to the Holocaust? </span><span class="sentence" id="825">Do you think that the Holocaust, I mean when you mentioned being predestined, having something written down... do you think of the Holocaust that way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And it’s very hard, maybe it’s because as a Jewish boy I can say this. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">You know, Jewish people accept Jewish jokes from another Jew, but if another one does the jokes, they don’t like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Did the Jewish people deserve what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Nobody deserve to suffer this way, but in the whole world, in the whole idea of human people, is it something who 1s going to serve humanity? </span><span class="sentence" id="832">I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">How many people, who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , in all those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , are going to be able to use it? </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Minority. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">But the one who are going to be able to do it are going to bring something and we don’t know where we’re going to put this. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">On the newborn? </span><span class="sentence" id="838">There is a new book, written by a Rabbi, and people don’t like him very much, because he write, he wrote this book about reincarnation. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And he said a lot of people call him, write to him and they say, “I’m born in a Catholic family. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">I’m Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I believe on Jesus Christ and I believe in God, but inside of me I got this Jewish feeling and I don’t understand why.” </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And it’s uh, how can I say, it’s surprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And from what he say, he thinks they were in the Holocaust and they reincarnate in another corps, but they got this knowledge and they want to explain this. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Long time ago, maybe not so long, but twenty years ago, you never spoke about reincarnation. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">A lot of people knew about, but they don’t want to say anything, because they say, “Well, they going to think I’m crazy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Now it is more open. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">Sometime when I feel people react and it’s a small group... I give a lot of lecture on acupuncture, and acupuncture related to the human body and the illness of some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And I go a little bit further and reincarnation and a lot of people react and say, “I felt this. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I felt I was in another life. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">I cannot pinpoint, but I know this is not my first life.” </span><span class="sentence" id="852">So, I think, coming back to the idea of the Holocaust, it served a purpose, which one, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">But I’m sure it serve a purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">If you say this to my brother, he’s going to laugh for three hour, but it’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And I 19 mean, it’s his problem, it’s not mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I don’t bring any proof, but I know there is a purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Can it be another Holocaust? </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">The same one we saw? </span><span class="sentence" id="860">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">It’s going to be something completely different, but <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> is here on <span class="NPIP">earth</span> , so anything can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">QUESTION:  When you think in those terms, how do you, how do the Germans fit in? </span><span class="sentence" id="864">So... are they carrying out something that needs to happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="865">That is predestined? </span><span class="sentence" id="866">In other words, are they attuned with destiny in some way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="867">ANSWER:  To answer your question you have to read a little bit about Hitler, which very few Jewish people want to touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I read the life of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">He didn’t have any chance in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">He could not succeed to nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">He was nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">He came at the right time and somebody above used him. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">But he was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Are we going to remember Hitler? </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Yes, for a long time, but not for the real purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Because who was Hitler? </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="878"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="879"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> need somebody like Hitler and if it was Hitler or George or anybody else, it would be the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">We speak about the devil. </span><span class="sentence" id="881"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the German people at this time, did find the chief of the devil and everything was so simple to organize. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">You see in life, people who try to organize something, something small, a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ... they never make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Because it’s not the time and somebody above Earth, who’s got the little button, don’t push the button, say, because it’s not for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">It’s not meant to happen, not with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">So we are not going to move.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="939">ANSWER:  I have a friend, he was an attorney and he raised his child, his boy, in the religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Not... but, he raised him as a Jewish boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And the boy 1s a spoiled, what I called a spoiled American boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And his father insists for him to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to see the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And he said, “Oh, I don’t want to go there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="944">He said, “I insist, I want for you to go see a little bit of what did happen.” </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And I said, “So?” </span><span class="sentence" id="946">when he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And he said, “Well, he was not the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">He didn’t have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">He heard Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">He knew it was a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , but he said, ‘It’s a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .’ </span><span class="sentence" id="951">But when he came back, it was not a joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">He said, ‘I didn’t know it was like this.’” </span><span class="sentence" id="953">And I think this is why there is a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="954">This is why you have people working in the Holocaust, not to forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Not to enjoy, but not to forget, for young people, Jew or Non-Jew, anybody, to see: This happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">This is not a movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">This happened, so you have to remember to do anything you can, we can, not to happen again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="958">QUESTION:  I’m pursuing kind of a metaphysical line of questioning, but do you think, so you feel like people have the power to make it not happen again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="959">ANSWER:  Yes, they do, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">If they know what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">Because if they don’t know what’s going on... When you see a movie and you know it’s fiction, if you see it or you don’t, it’s not a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">But when things happen... I have a movie from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="963">This <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liberated by the English army and the English are very tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">They show, they took the whole, bigger than a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I think it was about fifteen, twenty thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And they opened where they put all the dead, the cadaver, the Jewish people who they killed, they opened this with a special machine and they forced every people living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to carry a dead body and put it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to give them a decent burial. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Don’t you think they are going to remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Yes, they will. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Because when you touch with your hand, a dead body, you remember for the rest of your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And if we could make people touch people or nothing else, force the youth to go to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> here, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lexington</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , anyplace, once an hour, every week and just walk and see people suffering, they are going to be a little bit different. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">American youth think they are indestructible, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="971">They got the power. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">They can do anything until they die. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">This is why you have so many people who cripple themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">They jump from, with a cord around their feet, you know... “I’m the best,” you know, the guy who jump with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> in <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Okay, if the guy survive, it’s okay, if he die, everybody should see it, because life is not a joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">Life is a gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">You can use it badly and you can use it intelligently, but just by jumping and so you see... it’s like the guy who jumped from the <span class="BUILDING">Eiffel Tower</span> and he say, “Nothing can happen to me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And you know, he fall down and every stage, he say, “You see, nothing happened to me,” until he reach the downstairs and then that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">You don’t... gravity is like life, you don’t play game with life. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">Take a knife, stick 1t in your stomach and you’ll see what happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And everybody should know about the Holocaust just as a reminder. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Justice in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> 1s too lenient. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">Yesterday they liberate a man, who did abuse children. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">He got ten year and after five year, they let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">He’s going to do it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">What should we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="987">This is another discussion, but don’t let him loose, because he’s going to take care... he’s going to take another innocent child. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">This man is sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">We have to do something about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">But don’t say, “Well, you know, what can we 22 do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="991">What do you mean, what can we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="992">Let’s us do the best we can, but do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">Don’t let a man wild with normal people.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1218">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">The only thing he knew to tell is, I... you know those little bugs who eat potato? </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Every time, every day we did have to go for an hour and collect this and put it in a bottle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">And I used to say it hurt my back, so he used to call me Paul with the ribs who go up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">He cannot bend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">So this is why... he made fun of me, because he thought I was—and I was probably— lazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">Some work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> I didn’t like too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">I did like to go to the mushroom, but I didn’t like to bend and put my hand on this mud and all things, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">So, he always make fun of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">But he said, “You going to like to give speeches. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">You’re going to like to speak in front of crowd.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">And it’s true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">I give a lot of seminar and I feel very comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">I don’t have any problem with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And if some people ask me question I cannot answer, I said, “I don’t know the answer, but if you give me one of your card, I will find out and write to you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">But we never spoke about what kind of study I’m going to do or what is going to be my future, what kind of job I’m going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">Because I don’t think, I didn’t know anything myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">I don’t have any idea what I’m going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">But I know, the only thing I know is, they change my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">They... the orientation was different.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1241">QUESTION:  Can you talk about that moment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1242">ANSWER:  Well, I have to say something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">I don’t know if you’re going to find this funny or different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">I didn’t have a very good relation with my brother, Gaston. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">Never been real brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">Why, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">But my mother, when I was very young, I used to discuss with her, as long as she did have the power on me, it was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">But when I grew up and because of the separation of this, my attitude changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And my mother is a very, used to be a very strong personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">She wants to organize everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">Example, when I came to study chiropractic in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ... I was married at the time and my daughter was eighteen months old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">And she didn’t understand why I took my daughter with me instead of leaving my daughter with her for two year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">And I said, I don’t know how you can think about me leaving my daughter for two year, eighteen month? </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">I’m never going to be her father anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">So, we did have a very, very big discussion about this and for the time I was gone, she never spoke to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">And my brother, Bernard, reunite us when I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">But the problem 1s, I was at the time, as stubborn as she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">And we were always on challenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">I like her, I would do anything for her, but I couldn’t receive any order from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">And it’s a feeling very hard to explain, because like when I open my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> ... she came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">She wants to organize my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">And I said, “Mother, it’s my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , it’s my <span class="NPIP">place</span> and 27 I’m going to organize it my way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">You like it, you come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">You don’t like it, 1t’s too bad.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">But until the end, she wants to be the boss. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1267">Laughing.] </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">And she never could, because probably we were the same way, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">But so the relation was not, I saw my mother, jump on her, kiss her? </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">And my mother was not a kisser. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">One kiss a week was the top, no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">So she stay in her, in her back, and I stay, and my other brother, Gaston, is... 1t was, is and was a very funny character. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">He looks good and it was enough for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">So, he was thinking more to buy nice suit, nice thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">And when I came back he was a growing man and you know, he didn’t want to bother with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">I was the little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">So, the relation was short. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">End of Tape 2, Side B 28 Tape 3, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Okay, this is an interview with Dr. Paul Pressman, a continuation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">It’s now August 17", 1999, continuing our interview from July. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">And this is tape number three, side A. I wondered when I was looking over the notes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">I took some, listened to the interview that we did last time and I took some notes on things that we had talked about, and one thing which stood out, that I didn’t ask you about was, I wondered how you felt... you were talking about your mother’s role in the resistance and discovering that she was actually a fighter or a captain in the resistance movement and that she showed you this gun that she kept hidden in this book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">And I wondered how that effected your view of your mother and how, whether that moment was significant to you in some way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1284">ANSWER:  Not specifically, because I think I knew my mother since a long time, since I was very little, I mean when I was eight, nine years old, we did have very serious question to ask to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">And I think basically we didn’t, I didn’t have, she didn’t have any secret from me, so I was not surprised and not shocked to see what she was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">And she was doing this very naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">I mean, she didn’t show off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">It was what she was doing and that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">But it was not something... a big surprise for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">I never been afraid of gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">I never been excited over gun, but I understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">The question... it was no question in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">It was a normal way of life, knowing what she was doing before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">And it was, to me, a normal situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1295">QUESTION:  Knowing what she was doing before, meaning that...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1296">ANSWER:  Before she used to go, at the time when she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grenoble</span> , in south of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , she used to go and bring food, letter, visit French Resistance in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">And those people were guarded by German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">And she always found a way to go in, bring what she did have to bring. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">She did a lot of risky things, but the natural way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">So, knowing this, after this, knowing she was carrying a gun, didn’t surprise me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1301">QUESTION:  The reason that I noticed it and that I asked you about it, one reason was that the gun, the issue of your experiences with a gun came up a couple of times during the interview yesterday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">You talked about the one time that, or not yesterday but earlier, you talked about the one time Pastor Lederman got angry at you was when he saw you playing with his gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">And then you talked about that other incident with your mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">And then you mentioned also that you feel safer if you have a gun now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">And that was something you didn’t talk about on tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">And I was wondering if you would talk about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1307">ANSWER:  Well, it took me a long time before I could train myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">I have now thirty year of martial art behind me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">I always felt in general, the Jewish people don’t like gun, don’t like to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">I mean I speak about the Jewish people in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And it was a discovery for, I think, every Jewish people in the world when we found out Israelian soldier were one of the best in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">And I was not surprised, I was happy about, but generally, even up to this date, when you speak gun with Jewish people they don’t like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">Jewish people in general are not fighter, unless you go in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and they did what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">And this is why I always felt very secure, and when I was with my godfather in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , I did like to have this gun close to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">But it was very hard for me to explain to him why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">I always felt like if anything happened, maybe I’m going to die, but I’m 29 going to defend myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">I don’t want to die like a poor animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">I want to die, but before I’m going to die, somebody else is going to die, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">It was my feeling since a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">I was in very big contradiction with my brothers, but something I have to say... even I knew my father very little, my father used to carry all the time a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">I didn’t know why and I couldn’t ask the question, because I don’t think he would answer, but this is something I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">And maybe it’s because of this I always... But basically in my mind I think the reason I always like gun is because gun, you can defend yourself, without a gun, you dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1323">QUESTION:  Did your father carry a gun before the war, too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1324">ANSWER:  Yeah, absolutely, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1325">QUESTION:  So that meant when you saw your mother with a gun it wasn’t so unusual, because you had already seen your father with a gun and it was something you were used to having around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1326">ANSWER:  Exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">Because my mother never touch gun before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">I never saw, before the war, my mother with a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">But when I saw her with a gun, it makes sense to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">From where we come... it’s funny because we were four, five brother and we were so different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">The only one I know the best is the one who stay alive now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">And he is so different, like I said in the tape before and he’s not a fighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">He’s a good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">He’s not a fighter, and the only reason he came back is because he was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">And you can... you know, in front of so many SS or Nazi in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> you don’t have a... 1f they decide to kill you, they will kill you anytime they want. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">So when he came back, he came back because he was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">But my brother was not a fighter and I am a fighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">Like I told him many time, if I was in a camp, if they took me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> if they took me in Auschwitz, I wouldn’t survive an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">They would kill me right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">But the same idea, they would kill me, but I would kill somebody before I die.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1341">QUESTION:  Do you ever feel critical of those who didn’t struggle enough? </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">There’s been a lot a criticism of Jews during the Holocaust, that they didn’t struggle enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1343">ANSWER:  Well, it’s always... was bad feeling for me, to see, like when in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> they put together all the Jew in one big <span class="DLF">field</span> , closed completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">It was hard for me later, to understand why they didn’t do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">Why didn’t they organize? </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">The only time they organized themselves and most of them time it was Polish Jew, it was in the ghetto of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">This is where they organize, they fight, because they say die for die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">We going to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">But in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , no, because again we come back to the same idea, all the Jewish people from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> said, “I’m not Jewish, I’m French, Jewish is my religion,” which was true on the basic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">But the German said, “No, you Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">French Jew, German Jew, Italian Jew, you are Jew, you have to die.”</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="1569">What can he do with God, I cannot do directly if I want to do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">And this forgiveness came back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">And one day I was in a course of hypnosis and the teacher said, “Today we’re going to speak only about forgiveness.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">And I thought, God, this is great, and I learned every bit of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">And I practice this with me and with my patient. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">And it was wonderful, because people used to say, “I didn’t think this way before, but now it make it so easy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">And I thought to myself, I know, because I practice the same way for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">The more I can forgive things, easy my life is, and I come back always to the point zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">If you let, 1f you do a mistake and you go too far with this mistake, it’s very... longer you keep with, harder it is to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">So, try to rectify the mistake as soon as you can, so this way it’s going to be much easier to work on it and it’s going to be quicker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">So they teach you every time at night before you, when you go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , before you go to sleep, try to go very fast on your day and say, “Okay what happened today? </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">What did I do that was not good?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">So you try to forget yourself by being sorry and said “I’m not going to do this any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">I’m going to try to be better,” and also vice and versa, one way or another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">It’s amazing the way it works. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">It’s something very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">The only thing is, if you are willing to do it, it’s perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">If you don’t want to do it, it’s very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">And this is why, I try. </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">I stay about two weeks with my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">I said, “Bernard, I’m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">You’re going to be mad, if you want to throw me out from your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">But every day I’m going to speak to you about forgiveness, because this is your only savior.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">But he laugh, he became red sometime, he left the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , he took witness, friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">Okay, he took friend who thought like him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">And you know, if you ask a friend, after all the story of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , he survive and he say, “Bloing (ph), face to face, can I forgive this?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">People say, “No.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">But this is not what I ask him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">I don’t ask him to forgive this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">I want for him to forgive them their fault, they are the worst people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">He is not a bad man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">So forgive them for what they did to them and to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">But it was... I don’t think... maybe I put a little something on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , but for him it is too late. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">And I think, it’s not nice what I’m going to say, but I think also he enjoy a little bit his situation.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Does he feel guilty about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1612">ANSWER:  We cannot speak about that, so I cannot be pushy, because... The only thing I know, the only little thing, and he cannot hide this, because he said it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">You know, when you say something, it’s very hard to retract. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">When they arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I don’t remember the date, but they shave every man and woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">And they put them in a big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">And it was not very light, it was very dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">And one moment he was walking and he turn around and he sees this guy on his back all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">And he say, “Why do you follow me all the time like this?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">And he said, “But I’m Maurice, I’m your brother.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">He didn’t recognize him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">He was... and for me, my interpretation is, he was already gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">He put a <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">Not because... because the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">He said, “Okay, save your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">I save mine.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">This is the way I felt it and this is the way I understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">Maybe I’m wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">But this is the way I feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">Because in any situation if you don’t recognize your brother, your sister, your mother, it’s like what I said before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">Looks on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , “Everything here is mine, after this, I have nothing to do with it.”</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1634">ANSWER:  Even... even now it’s hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">It’s not... it’s not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">It’s not easy to forgive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">You can forgive little things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">But when it becomes so important, it’s not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">Because you have to visualize, and I’m good, I know how to visualize. </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">And when you see the whole picture... a month ago I read about this man in United State, who help people to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">I don’t remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">Cavajohn, something like this.</span></p>
