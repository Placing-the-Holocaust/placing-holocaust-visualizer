<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Did you want that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  And so, I immediately decided that the way I was going to get through <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , which I did, was athlete scholarships.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  And that was what's -- that was my father instigated 1t when he said, "I want you to be a college graduate, but you have to understand I don't have any money to give you."</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  So it enlarged -- the classes got bigger?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  You have to understand, in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of 5,000 where we're a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , that includes workers on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> that laid the ties, laid the <span class="DLF">track</span> and so on so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  You know some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> -- because I'm not familiar with the <span class="REGION">Midwest</span> -- some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> can be very homogenous, and some are not. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And that's the sense I'm trying to get 1s, "How much were there -- how much influence was there? </span><span class="sentence" id="136">How much knowledge was there? </span><span class="sentence" id="137">How much interaction was there with people who either would have been Jewish, people who would have been from Europe, people who were different from, let's say, a midwestern American?"</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  Well, that's very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Because when some new family moved in, the first question you ask them, "Can you play football or baseball or basketball?" [</span><span class="sentence" id="140">laughing].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Those were the important questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  Yeah, you do that, everything else is fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  [laughing] Those are not bad criteria actually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  But -- okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So I'll go about it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I'm trying to ask, "In <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , were current events talked about?"</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  Current events were talked about, but only in Europe, not <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So in other words, you heard what was going on in Europe?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So this was in the 30's --

<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  And what was it that you didn't believe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  That there was a Hitler who was killing people and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  At that time in the 30's, it would have been like political people -- it would have been people who were opponents ideologically from his regime.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  You mean you heard them in the original German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  Wow. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And were they translated then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  No, except my mother could speak a little Dutch, a litthe German and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And my friends -- some of my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And my minister, whose name was Reverend Joe Jordan, he could speak German fluently. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And he had been in World War I. So he pretty much kept us up to speed. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">He said -- again, I repeat -- I did not believe that this was actually happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  Yeah, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Okay.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">The answer is that "We did not believe in being involved in other people's wars." </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Let Hitler do what he's going to do in Europe and so on so forth, but we're not going to be involved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  That was a widespread feeling in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  That was very widespread.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Was it something that you took for granted as the right way to be?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  Did that change for you at any point?</span></p>

QUESTION:  That's not the word, huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">ANSWER:  No, that's because we're highly-trained. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">See, you're highly-trained so you wouldn't be scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">If you were scared and someone told you, "See that guy up on top of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> with a machine gun? </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Go kill him." </span><span class="sentence" id="682">You wouldn't do that unless you were highly-trained.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I guess what I'm trying to say is that, before you leave the <span class="COUNTRY">U.K.</span> -- before you leave <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> -- everything is theoretical. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">The minute you hit <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , it stops being theoretical.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="837">ANSWER:  There was a newspaper called "The Stars and Stripes," which was a weekly, and it had some world news in it -- but not much about <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="844">ANSWER:  I told you -- when I was in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , there was a rumor kind of floating around of things like this were going on, but I never believed it, and it never got much authenticity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">QUESTION:  Was there a time when that changed? </span><span class="sentence" id="846">When you started to believe it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">ANSWER:  I didn't believe it until after the war was over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="849">ANSWER:  I didn't really believe it, because we never got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="850">QUESTION:  So you were never at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> while you were in service?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And the reason I wasn't is because the rangers were involved in it at the last -- when I was in monuments bend. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">In other words, I was pulled out of the rangers -- which reminds me -- my ranger battalion went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="877">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">The answer is, "When I say '<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ', I know that's not correct."</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="886">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And, when people did say they had been there, what do you remember them telling you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="888">ANSWER:  Well, they came up with facts and figures -- I mean, not "facts and figures," but they came up with descriptions which defied absolute logic. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Even though people had seen it, it's really hard to accept unless you've seen it yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">QUESTION:  So it didn't really sink in with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="891">ANSWER:  Say again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">QUESTION:  It didn't sink in with you that much.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="900">QUESTION:  Yep. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">It's, you know, what we're doing now 1s trying to reconstruct what it looked like then. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">That's not so easy to do, but it's part of trying to get an historical record through, you know, a medium like an oral history interview is to remember what you didn't know at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">That's not so hard -- that's not so easy to do when you already know something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="905">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Let's go back then to -- you know, you bring this officer back whom you were his now lifesaver. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">You dragged him back to your <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">You weren't able to finish your mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">What happened then?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="915">ANSWER:  The Battle of the Bulge was a complete surprise to the Americans -- to Eisenhower and so on so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">On Christmas Day, I was -- in the morning I had been on a mission -- a reconnaissance mission -- and I came back, and I was laying down to sleep and someone came in -- I was in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , in somebody's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and all I remember 1s I pick up my rifle and ran to the <span class="DLF">window</span> , because I thought they were telling me that we were being attacked right then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="917">QUESTION:  And what was the actual case?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="921">ANSWER:  This was -- Eisenhower is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And he put his <span class="DLF">line</span> right across the Battle of the Bulge and divided the responsibility between Patton in the south and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montgomery</span> in the north. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">So British troops here were under Patton. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">American troops up here were under Montgomery.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="925">QUESTION:  Isn't that interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">You know -- a switch, that British troops would be under an American general.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="927">ANSWER:  But that was only because he had to have some responsibility.</span></p>
