QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And my, my father’s parents had a <span class="DLF">farm</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My father’s parents, they had the <span class="DLF">farm</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> and Mother and I went there several times in order to get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">They, they did not suffer so much because they had all kinds of animals and, and, and, it’s, it, it wasn’t too bad for them and when we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we always had food for the few weeks to eat, until that went low again and then we went back to them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">They were very good to us and I have very vivid memories of my grandmother, who carried me on her back, no perambulator or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">She just carried me on her back. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So I must have been very little and probably very light also. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So when the war was over my father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">He was a mechanical engineer and there was no job for him to get so he worked as a ditch digger and in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> as this and in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> as that until the situation had settled.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  What was your mother’s name and her family background?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  My, my mother’s name was Anna Steiner, and my grandfather had, well <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> is said too much, he had a little, what would you say...
ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Shop</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  A little <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> where he produced linen and I still have napkins from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And one tablecloth that he, he produced, it’s a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And he lost that and my grandmother and two sisters and a brother were alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Grandfather died. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And she...
QUESTION:  He lost that because of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  No, that was before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">There, I do not know whether you are familiar with European history but there was a very, very hard time and people like now, they just had to close up. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">There was no more, asking for good supplies and good things. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">People bought whatever they could and as long as it wasn’t too expensive and apparently what he produced was very expensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">You can see if I have now still something that he produced, it must have been good. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Now it’s more than hundred years now almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So, my mother and my father married in 1909 and I was born in 1913.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  My mother had one stillborn child. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">That, that was all, no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">That was before me. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I was an only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">He claims you can still see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">But it doesn’t, ;
QUESTION:  What were your parents’ political leanings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  My father was a Social Democrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">He was very much concerned with the welfare of poor people and he tried to help as much as he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">He became a councilman in the city council and he was, he was kind of, well shunned, because wherever it was and wherever he went he would say, ““That’s fine but, but you have to do something for those people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="56">For instance he organized that, at Christmas, baskets would go out with food to poor families and of course, he wasn’t loved for that by the people who had to fill the baskets. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And, I guess I grew up in that spirit. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I still love to send baskets too but I send them, so. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And my mother was very helpful in everything that had to be done in this respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">In fact, my father used to say, “If you want something from Mother, she will give you her last shirt.” </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And it, it was true, so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  Did you have a particular religious upbringing, religious education, also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">My mother was very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">She was Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">She was very religious in the way that she thought you have to, you have a certain amount of obligation and you have to help wherever her, you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">That was mostly her religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">The rest of her family, there was one aunt who went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> almost daily and my father didn’t think very much in religious terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">He always said that religion is the crutch of the poor and the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> tries to keep them in bondage. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">That was his feeling SO aS you can see my, for some time, I went to <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> because apparently it was then already, also better than the public schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It was not too good an experience for me, and I dropped out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  What was your father’s attitude toward Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  I don’t know, he never had any. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">For us, in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , my father had a friend who was a priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">They came and they came together and they argued for hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And my father used to say, “And where was God when, on the, on the, in the war when the people were lying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> moaning and dying by the hundreds? </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Where was God then?” </span><span class="sentence" id="78">That’s what people ask now about the Holocaust, too, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">He had the same attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We had, we had Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I had a very, very good Jewish friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">She died last year in <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We, we kept very close all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Whether somebody was as he always said, “Whether somebody’s green, blue or red, it doesn’t matter, as long as they are good.” </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And this was his attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And for religious reason, he didn’t really, I don’t think he had any feelings for or against any kind of religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He just didn’t believe into the doctrines of the religions. [</span><span class="sentence" id="88">talkover]
QUESTION:  Did you, do you remember from your childhood seeing any type of anti-Semitism or any type of discrimination? </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Were you aware of, of that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Discrimination, really only against me. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">My father, we, I was once detained, wrongly in the afternoon and my parents were very concerned that I didn’t come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , even then you didn’t know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">If your child is supposed to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at one thirty, and at three or four o’clock, it’s not at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you wonder. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So my father came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I recall that the, the priest had kept me and a few other girls in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a very funny incidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">He asked what was Christ when he was for 40 days in the, in the desert and there was no food and that was at this time, the time of the people who were called “hunger artists”. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I don’t think you know what that means here. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">There were people who were going on a hunger strike for so and so long in order to, to show, to prove something. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And when, when the priest asked what was Christ, one of the girls said, “A hunger artist.” </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And then he said, “Who said that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And of course, nobody did say so I was one of the ones who were supposed to have said it and three or four others were there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And my father came and he told the priest that what he did was wrong because he can keep me at, if he thinks I did something wrong the next day, am I too wordy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  [negative grunt]
ANSWER:  That he can keep me the next day but not on the day when my parents don’t know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And from this day on when the priest came into the class, every morning he said, “ go into the corner.” </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And then I had to stand all, all the whole hour until the hour was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So this was the discrimination I experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Well, then there, of course, the girls or the boys that were not Catholic, they could sit in the rear of the class but I didn’t find that this was discrimination.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  When you, when you say not Catholic, were these Protestants or, or Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Protestant and Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">They were, they could sit in the rear of the class and they could read or do anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I never felt that this was discrimination. [</span><span class="sentence" id="110">talkover] I, no, not exactly, but I know that three girls I was close with, they were in my class...
QUESTION:  Three, there were three Jewish girls.</span></p>

ANSWER:  <span class="BUILDING">Teacher college</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  It’s a <span class="BUILDING">teacher’s college</span> , okay, and while I, in my free time, I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish kindergarten</span> which I enjoyed immensely. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I, I never knew that I would love children that much but it was a delightful job. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I even thought sometime that I would write about the sayings of the children and their behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I never did of course, that was just a dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And then after I had my degree I started, I tried to start to work in a <span class="BUILDING">public kindergarten</span> but it was absolutely impossible because as I applied for the job, the interviewer told me, “Well, I tell you, we do take two people a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We hire two people a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">We have hundred and three applications so you figure out how long it will take before you are being hired.” </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So my, my aspects of being a being a public kindergarten teacher went all the way down. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Then I just tried to get all kinds of jobs and it was ’33, the time when it was very, very hard to get jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">There was the big crash on the, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Borse</span> , on the <span class="BUILDING">stock market</span> and in Europe it was the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Jobs were very scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So finally I did get, I worked as a secretary in a, in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , no, no, in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> that imported wood from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Then I worked for sometimes in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> that imported from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , dryers, commercial dryers and what else did I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And then I, one of my father’s acquaintances lost his wife and he needed somebody to take care of his books and help him in his praxis. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I took that job and this is when I met him while I was there and I, I stayed in this job until I was arrested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Let’s go back to your working with children. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">You were working with, in this <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> immediately after you got out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  No, no, no, while I was studying. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I was working two or three [talkover] three days, yah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  As an intern.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  Studying to be a teacher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> is quite different. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I do not know whether this like that here but I remember that we had to work for three months in an <span class="BUILDING">institute</span> for the blind. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Three months in an <span class="BUILDING">institute</span> for the deaf! </span><span class="sentence" id="188">and three months we worked in an <span class="BUILDING">institute</span> or <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> for the retarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And I remember that this was the hardest part of my studying, so. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And whatever I had on free time, I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , partly as part of my training, partly also because I liked it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  What did you like about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="192">You said you were surprised by how much you liked it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  What was that experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  Well, I always liked children but I never knew how much you can do to help them grow up and to help them to develop their abilities to see the world, to learn how to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I remember that I tried to teach them English, English songs and one of the first one was pitter patter pit pat, listen to the rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">You know that? </span><span class="sentence" id="198">No, you don’t know an English children’s song?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  You want to sing it?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="270">ANSWER:  What was the point? </span><span class="sentence" id="271">So she says, “Visit me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="272">people there so I said, “No. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Not if there are people there.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  So then we, we went out a couple of times together and then we thought well, this is something that will go into something more, more earnest and I wanted, well then he said, told me that he would never marry a Jewish girl, a non Jewish girl and whether I would consider converting. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And somehow I felt that converting was absolutely not necessary for me because my feelings were anyhow for, against Nazism and for everything that stood in Jewish life. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">But we broke up anyhow, so, because he didn’t want to put any kind of pressure on me and we parted. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And then came Christmas and he send me a lilac bush, a white lilac bush as a Christmas gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">It’s, in a, it was for long time in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> of a cousin of mine in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I don’t know whether it’s still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">He died and so on and a friend of mine when she saw that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bush</span> she said, “Eh! </span><span class="sentence" id="281">That means marriage.” </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And I told her, ““You’re crazy, we just broke up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="283">She was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">So we got the, I, I called him and I thanked him and we got in touch again and then the, our, the relationship became much closer and we decided we would marry. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I would convert and we would marry. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And then Hitler came.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  I was aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I was very much aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And especially my father was aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">He was, I think, much more aware because he was politically much more astute than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And after we were married, it was very kind of sad affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">My father, his brother, I and he. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I think, I don’t remember anymore who walked first. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We went to the, to the <span class="BUILDING">Seitenstadter Temple</span> where Rabbi [talkover] Tageslicht had agreed to marry us.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  I had converted, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But there was no mikvah anymore so the conversion was not complete but it, I was converted as far as Tageslicht went and he, he took into consideration all the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">QUESTION:  What did you have to do to convert?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  I, first of all I had to study and I had to tell him a lot about Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I told him my thoughts about Judaism and so on and apparently, whatever we talked and whatever I had learned about, he, he was satisfied when he questioned me. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And then, when we got married it was a very short ceremony and we all, I guess, listened, whether the SS is coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And after, afterwards, we just all left the way we came, one behind the other and he went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I, I don’t think I went with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  I only later came to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  Yah.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  Was illegal from both points, from the Jewish point of view and from the...
ANSWER:  Nazi point of view.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  Nazi point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">From the Jewish point of view because she had not really fully completed the conversion. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">She had completed it according to his saying but she had not fulfilled all the requirement. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">She hadn’t studied enough and there was no mikvah, but Rabbi Tageslicht was a good friend of mine from, I was and he knew her and he felt that she’s a very valuable person as he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And he said, “If she converts, well you cannot wish for better Jewish children than from her.” </span><span class="sentence" id="314">He was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So he says and from the Nazi point of view it was a major, very major crime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  We both would have been killed if they would have found out so it was, as I said it was a rather sad affair.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  He would have been killed too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER:  And probably he too. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">But killing for them was a very easy thing so...

<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  At this time...
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Maybe it wouldn’t have been possible, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">But I feel, for one reason or another I always feel guilty that I let those two down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">QUESTION:  Will you try to describe or reconstruct your growing political awareness?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  It started to become more political, not only feelings after I had met Bill. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">He told me about the plight of the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and he told me about <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And that was, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> was something that was not in my thinking at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">It was too far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">But through him I became aware of so many things and I recall the first time when he told me that he had collected some betterim(ph) from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they would go illegally to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and he showed me and introduced me to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It was always very clandestine. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">It always had to be very secretly so that I wouldn’t be caught with any one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And then he asked me whether I would consider keeping his, we were not married then, keeping his, the passports of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And I remember that I kept all the 16 passports and I was a very, very big secret agent. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I put them into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">leather chair</span> here in the rear and I thought that would be absolutely safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But fortunately nobody looked for them and nobody came and asked so it was safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">That was the first time when I really was involved in saving some people’s lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I, I knew about it but I, I only knew intellectually but now I had met the people and it was quite different. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And from then on as I was aware of his and became more and more aware of his activities I, I was, let’s say caught.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  I think that I was, I was drawn to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">As I told you before it was his spirit and it was his mentality that drew me to him and then when I realized that he was going out, out of his way and forgetting about himself and helping other people even to the, to the maybe end that he’s would be killed, it, it formed a bond. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And if I think about it now, it might also be that 1t reminded me of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I never thought about it, it just occurred to me now. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So you are now my therapist. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">But it, it might be that because my father was always so concerned with the underdog that this was another attraction.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">QUESTION:  How did your father feel about Dr. Perl? </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Did, what was...
ANSWER:  He didn’t have very many feelings except that he said, “You’ll get into problems and you, you don’t know what you are heading for.” </span><span class="sentence" id="372">But he would never say don’t do it or don’t do that, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">He just said, “He will be working and he will have to work and at times he will have to forget about you and wherever you will be. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">If you are together, you will be an albatross about his neck and if you are not together, you will have to worry and worry and worry.” </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And this is how it was.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="389">ANSWER:  I could have probably gone because I could travel very freely but it, at this time it was for many reason not possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">My mother was very sick and I, I just didn’t want to abandon her. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And then as my father always pointed out again and again, “You’ll be an albatross about his neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Don’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">He will have so much to do, so much to worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">He has to worry about his safety and the safety of the people whom he tries to, to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">If you would go, it would not be a good thing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I realized that and I didn’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And then when Bill was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> he sent an affidavit for my parents and for me but the war had broken out and it was not, and my mother had died and very shortly after my mother died, my father died. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Fortunately in a way because then when I was arrested I didn’t have to worry about anybody but myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I knew he was halfway safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I knew he was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="731">Now while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> there was a girl there who told, who had come in from <span
