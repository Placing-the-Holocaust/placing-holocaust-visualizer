<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell me your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Edward Lessing or I was born Eleazar Lessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in the 8th of May, 1926. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I was born in a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I like to say I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bethlehem</span> because that was the name of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Q; Tell me about your family, will you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Well, how far back do you want me to go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  To your childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I'd like to know about your parents, your grandparents, if you will, and your earliest memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Well, I would like to introduce you to my family as far back as my great grandfather in a hurry? </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My great grandfather...his name was Jacob. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Jacob Lessing was a tailor in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He had a nickname. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">He was called Uncle Kool. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">He was an interesting, colorful character. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And he had let me see. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">He had a whole bunch of children, but my grandfather was also a tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">His name was Isaac. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">There was Jacob, my great grandfather; Isaac was my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">My grandfather was also a tailor, but he was the first one to move out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and set up a <span class="BUILDING">tailor shop</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in what was then one of the newer sections of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> which is now right in the heart of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And he moved around quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">He moved with his family to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> right near the <span class="BUILDING">Royal Palace</span> of the Queen and many of his clients were barons and baronesses of the <span class="BUILDING">Court</span> for a while there. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So he was a tailor all his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Later on he became an important man in one of the big clothing industries of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">He was the first one to set up a <span class="DLF">assembly line</span> kind of procedures. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So essentially, he was a tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">He had three sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">My father, Nathan; his old brother, Jacob; and my father's youngest brother, Joseph. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">They all had different nicknames though. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">My father called himself Nardus. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I don't know how he got to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I never found that out. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">N-A-R-D-U=S. Nardus. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And Jacob was called Jaap, which is a Dutch name, Jaap. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">J-A-A-P, Jaap. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And Joseph was called Joop, J-O-O-P. Jacob died before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Joseph was killed by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So was his wife, Jeana and their little son, whose name I can't recall right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">In essence, those three people are the only ones in my family, my direct family...near family that were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Everyone else either had died before or died a natural death. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So my father's older brother died 01:04: before the war, and his younger brother died in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in, I think, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So my father...oh, by the way, this younger brother, Joseph or Joop was also a tailor or went into the clothing industry, helped by my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">My father was the only one who somehow or other got into a completely different profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">He became a musician. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And when he was 17 he left his <span class="BUILDING">parental house</span> ...<span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and from what I can find out he never returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">He booked on or he signed on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> as a musician at 17, and it was his first trip overseas, and he never forgot it. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">He always told me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So he was a musician all his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">No matter what he tried to get out of it, he never...he never managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He tried many things, together with my mother later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">They tried to set up <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> and sell things and it never worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Papa always came back to being a musician. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So let me say now...
QUESTION:  Tell us about you as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">What was your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> like growing up as a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Well, it's a little difficult to tell you because my father and my mother married in 1925 and had me, of course, in 1926, and traveled around a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">In 1929, for instance, my parents decided that they would go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">They would follow in the path of my aunt and uncle who had moved there. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">They had moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">My aunt and uncle lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holyoke</span> , <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> , and my parents decided that that they also wanted to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So 1929, I, as a three year old, arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , and learned to speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">However, they had a lot of bad luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">1929 wasn't a very good year to arrive in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> as you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So Pop had a hard time finding work and, in addition he got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">He got tuberculosis, which ran in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Tuberculosis was a kind of a family disease with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">A lot of members had it...got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">My daughter got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Pop got tuberculosis and had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And Mom had to go and scrub <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and later worked in a <span class="BUILDING">travel agency</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And I was farmed out to to a lady who was supposed to take care of me, but who took very badly care of me for one of the reason I have been in psychotherapy for the last 22 years is that [it] didn't help what happened later on [in] the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So we moved to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> in 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Pop not finding work. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Well, very occasionally, he had some friends in the Boston Symphony who helped with the summer engagement, but all in all he didn't find much work. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">In 1932 they moved back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> they moved around from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> , wherever Pop could find work. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Pop worked as a musician mostly in <span class="BUILDING">night clubs</span> , <span class="BUILDING">bars</span> or <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> , <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> , in the time that <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> still had live music, you know, little trios and... So we moved around quite a bit throughout <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I once counted that between the time that I was born and the war that we had...and the war was 1940, so it's between 1926 and 1940, that I once counted approximately 32 addresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So that's a lot, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Some <span class="NPIP">places</span> , we may have been only...I don't know, a month so, but we had a lot of moving around. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So my parents, as I said, came back in 1932 to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Then Pop started playing and my mother had...my mother got three...three more children. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">One, another boy after me, died. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">His name was Joop...Joop again named after my grand...I guess great grandfather Jacob. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">He died when he was 9 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">It was a terrible blow for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And as my father said...a psychiatrist...he had consulted a psychiatrist because my mother was...was totally distraught. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">He said the best thing was to get Mother a child as quick as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">She got two more children. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Two...my two brothers, my brother, At, and my brother Fred. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So there's a difference...a big difference between my brothers and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">The next my brother At is 8 years younger and my brother, Fred, is 10 years younger than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So I sort of stood alone most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I was alone...a loner. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We lived the last years before the war sort of in The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And just before...a year before the war...I think 1939, with the help of my grandfather, who you may recall was a tailor, opened a <span class="BUILDING">clothing store</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> , the nearby small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">01:10: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> is located between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , a beautiful little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where Delft pottery comes from. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So we moved there and that was...no I was going to say it was the last move before the ...that was the last move before the war, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So the war of 1940...the invasion, the German invasion found us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> with a sort of a small <span class="BUILDING">clothing store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And when the war broke out, I was 14, and my brother Fred was 4 and my brother At, was 6. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Does that give you some background on my family? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">What else would you like me to go into at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  Tell us what happened when the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Can you remember’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I was 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">The war broke out 2 days after my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">My birthday was the 8th of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I remember very well getting a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">canoe</span> for my birthday because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> is sometimes called the Venice of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It's riddled with <span class="DLF">canals</span> , little <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It's [a] very, very beautiful little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I got the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">canoe</span> on the 8th of May and I was very happy with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It was my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And on the 10th...that was the 8th of May, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And on the 10th of May, 5 o'clock in the morning, I woke up to thunderous noises, machine gun fire, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> flying over. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Great commotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Dawn was just breaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It was a most beautiful day. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">It was sun[ny], warm, unusual day for <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I went upstairs, looked out of the <span class="DLF">attic windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">The <span class="DLF">sky</span> was full of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> men were jumping with parachutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I thought it was fabulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">It was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I tried to climb on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Almost got shot down by Dutch machine nest which had been placed right near the <span class="DLF">hole</span> by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">My father ...my father retrieved me from the <span class="DLF">roof</span> and said you shouldn't be doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I thought it was fabulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I mean this was like stuff you'd see in the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I was 14 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">What the Hell did I know? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Besides, we hadn't the faintest idea of what was going on really. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We thought it was sort of an exercise of the Dutch, probably Dutch air force. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">No idea of what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">We soon found out, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">By news that came from the radio that the Germans had invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">To give you a little background in this, <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> hadn't been in a war as far as I know since the Napoleonic war. </span><span class="sentence" id="139"><span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> was neutral in the first world war. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Matter of fact, I remember my father telling that in their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ...at my grandfather's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they had a Belgian refugee. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Somebody from the first world war fled the battlefields in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> and lived with them for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I think that was the most exotic story that happened ages ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Of course, I never realized that that 01:14: was in that time only maybe 25 years ago or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> wasn't a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that was used to battles and war. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The idea that there was a actual war going on was...was ludicrous in our eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I mean it was...but it took 5 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">After the first morning, it sort of died down. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">My father almost got shot I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">He wanted to go out get something to eat near the nearby <span class="BUILDING">grocery</span> and there was Dutch soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">You see, we had a <span class="DLF">street</span> that had in the middle a <span class="DLF">canal</span> , and on each side, couple thin <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and across the <span class="DLF">canal</span> on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> was a Dutch soldier standing and Pop opened the <span class="DLF">front door</span> and shouted to the Dutch soldier...was it alright and go to the <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And the soldier misunderstood him and fired at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And the bullet hit in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> right next to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">That would have been the end of my father right there and then. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So my father was in a hurry very pale. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Five days the war took and, of course, in the course the Germans bombarded <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> and brought the Dutch government to its knees in a hurry. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And quiet reigned after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">As a boy I remember going out with a friend as soon as the war was over and going out on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> , and there were all these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> that had been shot down...one right next to another...these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> that had dropped parachute troops which were easy targets because these were slow flying <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">One after another. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And we thought it was fabulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">All these crashed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and... I'll give you a cute little sideline. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Everyone one of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> had two engines. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And on each engine was a little plaque. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Blue and White. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">It said <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">BMW</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And to this day, it's very difficult for me to accept anyone driving a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with those emblems. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Of course, there is a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They're preferred <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="170">But to me, that symbol means war and German invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">That's strange isn't it. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">So as a boy and with my friends on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , we thought it was all fabulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">All these crashed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , and I remember going out to some other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> that were parked. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">The Dutch had parked some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> under <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Supposedly, if there would be some battle and these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> had never been touched. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">They were totally outmoded <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">By the way, my friend and I loved <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I still do. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So my friend and I went in there and got instruments out of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> you know, and for the first time I had a real instrument out of an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So you realize that, to me, the German invasion was kind of...well, it was a little scary, but it was a lot of fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">There was a lot of excitement. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And when the first German rolled into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...the first one that I saw was in a camouflage suit with a...with a typical German helmet on, and on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> with a sidecar and in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sidecar</span> was another German. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And they all had camouflaged suits and...and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> were...oops... Maybe you want to make a break here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  Can we stop the tape a minute please. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">We need to fix this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  I've had quite a time with this mike. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">This is the second time it fell off. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Is this alright now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  You're fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">You tell me when I should resume.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">You're fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">You were looking at all these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  And the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">The first Germans right on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">They were kind of curious specimens. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">They didn't speak Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They sort of roared through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">They seemed harmless. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">As a boy I had no idea what this really meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We settled in with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">By now, the Germans would march through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> as they [were] singing sometimes or they would walk by the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">As a matter of fact, there was a German came into my <span class="BUILDING">father's store</span> to buy a suit and my father helped him and the guy bought a suit. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I think he bought two suits and he bought that. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Life seemed normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We seemed to be able to live with this you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">That's how it all started. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Nice days in May. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Strange people walking the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , but rather harmless. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">It would all be over pretty soon anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">That was the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">The war would be over soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">It would last maybe a couple of months and then the English would come and the American would come and the Russians...no, the Russians...I guess...they hadn't invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Well, then, of course, the English got defeated and the English and French got defeated 1n a hurry in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and there was Dunkirk and then everything came to sort of a standstill you know, sort of the English were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and life would go on until the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And very slowly, very slowly, things began to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Little notices in the newspapers about.... Now, I don't exactly know the sequence, of course, but little notices in newspapers such as Jews were not allowed anymore to live right near the <span class="REGION">coastal areas</span> because they could be traitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And then some weeks later maybe there would be a notice that said that Jews shouldn't have any radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">So every Jew was supposed to bring his radio to <span class="BUILDING">town hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">This went all through the Dutch government you see, so it all didn't seem so terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">It and the reaction of my parents and I guess most Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> who hadn't been repressed for 300 years probably was that was a minor thing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They wanted our radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So the hell with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">We'd bring the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">If they wanted us not to live in the <span class="REGION">coastal areas</span> , so we'd move inland a ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">It all seemed rather...how shall I say childish to us....all this nonsense, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And the choice always was either you comply or you go to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Well, nobody in my family had ever gone to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">You didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">You didn't...the Dutch were very disciplined people. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">When somebody said don't go through this <span class="DLF">gate</span> because that 1s private property, you didn't go through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">You followed the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And these laws were new laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So the idea was... mean you begin...you begin to feel something was going on there that we didn't like, of course, but it was easier to comply with it than to to get thrown in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">You weren't going to be thrown in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for having a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">This is crazy you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So you brought your radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">But then a little later on... think 1t was a matter of copper and brass and all kinds of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And for strange reason we thought that was kind of ridiculous so we took all...I remember taking all our copper and brass pots that we had in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">It wasn't...my parents weren't very rich so it wasn't much of any consequence and burying it somewhere in a <span class="DLF">park</span> , where we were sure after the Germans were gone, we'd dig it up and put it back on the shelf. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">As a matter of fact, after the war I went back and never find the Goddamn stuff back. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I never could find a <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It was so changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Who the hell knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So there was this slow infiltration of little things. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And the best thing was to comply with it because the alternative was heavy punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">None of it seemed worthwhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Then it was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Jews shouldn't have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">We should bring all our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">People brought their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I don't think we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Now let's see. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">How did it go on? </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Then there came a decree. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And this is all issued in the Dutch newspapers, mostly through Dutch authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">It would say that the German command had issued a decree to the Dutch government, and the Dutch government said that Jews were no longer allowed to have <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Well, my father had a big business, so they sold all the clothing as fast and made quite a bundle of money because by that time clothing was rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">They sold the clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And rented a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...a large <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> in a different <span class="NPIP">location</span> ...had many <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> there...had 17 <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> I think, and rented out <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> to students. </span><span class="sentence" id="261"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">university town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So they set themselves in sort of a business renting <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> to students which was a very common business 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> because there was so many students and lots of people just lived on renting out <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> to students. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So they did that, and they got this big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I remember and lots of <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And meanwhile, new decrees slowly came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Jews couldn't have this. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Jews couldn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Jews couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I was a teenager, and I was in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">By the way, I was an awful student. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Probably one of the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">My parents were at wits end with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I was a lousy student. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I was a clown. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I had a good time everywhere and tried to attract attention by being very funny and was held back several times and finally my father, you know, said, "I don't know what the hell to do with him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="276">He went to to a friend and said what should I with this boy? </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And he said, "Why don't you let him learn a profession?" </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So I was sent to, what do you call that,...a <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span> , which was kind of shame because there weren't any Jewish kids in <span class="BUILDING">trade schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">This was for non-Jewish kids who wanted to become carpenters and electricians and stuff like. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Here I was and I was supposed to first become an electrician. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And, of course, I horsed around there too and didn't learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And then I was switched and my father talked with someone and said, "What should my son do? </span><span class="sentence" id="283">What do you think is a good profession.” </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And this man said, "Do you know what's a good profession? </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Instruments making, tool maker.” </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And so I started studying for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And...but as I said one bad day there was a notice in the paper that Jewish children couldn't go to the regular <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> anymore...could go only to special <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Since I lived in a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , there were no special <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">All in all maybe in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> before or during the war...I said before...at the beginning of the German invasion, my guess is maybe that there were maybe 150 maybe 200 Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">It's a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So we knew most of them by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">No Jews in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore meant that I couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">So I was out of <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And Pop said to me...he said "Well, you know the best thing is maybe you should learn to play music.” </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Because he was a musician. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So I took up the trumpet for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And I kinda liked that. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I played...started studying the trumpet with a teacher, a very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Everyone felt sorry for me that I couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore, you know, that kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So I studied the trumpet for a while, and I also played the piano. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Pop gave me lessons which was horrendous because it's very, very terrible to take lessons from your parents, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">It didn't work out too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">He taught me piano, and I still play the piano. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Then...oh, and I also had a part-time job as a delivery boy for a fora pharmacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">All these things to keep me busy while my parents got more and more worried about what was going on of course.. I still don't think I grasped exactly what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I just sort of went along with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Then came a decree one day that you had to wear a star. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">All Jews had to wear a star if they went out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So my mother sewed on stars on my clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And I remember an incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I have a cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">My cousin, Hans, who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span> , <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">He's about my age, and at the time we looked a little bit similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And we had both gotten the same overcoats from my father's former <span class="BUILDING">clothing store</span> , so we looked like twins. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And Hans always said, "Let's go out and walk like twins.” </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So we put on the same socks, shirt, much as possible...same outfit and we walked as twins. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">That was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Except I had a star. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">He didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Well, that was the only thing different. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">His mom...his mother...my Aunt Clara had married a non-Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So Hans was only half Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And I remember walking through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> and once get stopped by a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">This was the only time a German physically touched me. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I was stopped by this German. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">We were stopped by this German in our same overcoats. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And the German said to my cousin, Hans, "What're you do walking with a Jew?" </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And I said, "He's my cousin.” </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And the German slapped me full in the face and I fell on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Pow. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Like this...he said something like "You lousy Jew.” </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And he said to my cousin, "Don't let me ever see you walking with him...with a Jew.” </span><span class="sentence" id="334">It's the only time that I physically was abused by a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And I'll never forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">When I think of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and what people went through that's my only reference. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">That incident was like...I think it must have woken me up to what was really going on to some extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Not that I remember it as such now, but that was the only time that I was really physically abused by those bastards, if I can use that expression. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Well, he went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And, of course, my cousin and I still would be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">As a matter of fact during the war, I spent a short time hidden by my Aunt Clara. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Hans and I would go out at night after dark...go to the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic churches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I'll get back to that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">It's little bit of ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Well, the shipments [1.e. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">deportations?] </span><span class="sentence" id="347">begin. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Jews were to register, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We had all registered I presume at the beginning of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I forget that part because some point or another we all supposed to register and we all did. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">The punishment I guess for not registering was death. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So...what the hell? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">You go to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">What's the big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Since in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , ostensively there was no anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I mean you could walk out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> with a star. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Nobody'd say, "Hey, you lousy Jew.” </span><span class="sentence" id="358">It was like a sign of respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">People felt sorry for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">It was kind of nice to have people feel sorry for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Shipments began, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Since I lived in a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it didn't immediately hit us that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">It happened mostly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> ...big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where there was thousands and thousands of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And you heard this and you read about it and, of course, we got the Jewish newspaper that was published by something called the Joodse Raad, the Jewish Committee in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , that sort of tried to regulate...diminish the pain sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">But in the process actually now as I look back at it helped the Germans, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">But there again...the goal was to...if somebody had to go and work in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as it was held up to us, they would...let's first send healthy people who are not going to suffer too much from the cold there. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So they regulated who would go on shipments and so on and who would not. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">All that for us a little bit far away, but we knew that someday we will have to go and work in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">This was...now I want you to understand this very clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">That not until May 1945, the liberation of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , did I have the slightest idea of what was going on with these people who were sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">We had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I don't know who... Some people must have. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">As far as we were concerned, you went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And I remember very much very well a member of my family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> ...I think a cousin of my father's...who stood in the open <span class="BUILDING">market</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">stall</span> and sold underwear and socks. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Saying, her name was Beppie saying, "What's the big deal? </span><span class="sentence" id="377">We work like dogs here. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So we'll go work over there if they want us to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">This was commonly accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And so my father and mother in anticipation of being shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , having to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to work, got nice bundles of backpacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">We got blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">We got water containers or whatever...socks. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">You know, socks, warm shoes, whatever...sweaters. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">It was all neatly in a closet in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">We were ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">All set. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">We'd be warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">01:36: We'd have clothing, blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">We'd go and if we had to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , we'd go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">It might be a little colder. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Papa and Mom would have to work a little harder, but gee, they were used to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">We were all set. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Interesting thing is that my grandfather came over from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and he, of course, told horror stories of thousands of Jews being shipped off and the way I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I don't know if I have this from a story by my grandfather or by my father or I was there myself at that particular instant that my father and mother opened this <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> and showed my grandfather how well they were prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">How beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Backpack and how wonderful the blankets, and my grandfather saying, "Do you think you're going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to work? </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And my parents saying, "Yes.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="398">You're not going to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">You're going to get killed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">You're gonna die there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Not that I think he knew that we were being murdered outright but that 1t was cold and that you'd work yourself to death and that you might die in..you know, like in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , people died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And it's at that point I guess that my parents decided we weren't going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Now the penalty for that was death. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But by now we came to a state where you had to choose between possibly instant death by being caught and by being set up against and the <span class="DLF">wall</span> being shot or being shipped to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to maybe die of cold and hunger or whatever that was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Surely no one came back from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So I guess at some point my parents decided, "We're going to take the chance.” </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And when I think about it now, it's almost impossible to convey what it must have meant for my parents who had never defied a single law in their life in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">To defy a law that had the death penalty on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">But they decided. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">They made a decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Now this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was very small and there was a gentleman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , Mr. Kohn, who was sort of the Joodse Raad, the member of the committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> who was to oversee shipment of people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I guess he was made responsible or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">He was a German Jew who had immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">He knew what it was all about I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And he said, "I'll give you a warning when they come to get you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And I guess as close as I can find out, in October 1942, the warning came. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">They're coming to get you. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">My father and mother, two brothers, and I just put on coats and walked out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Shut the <span class="DLF">door</span> behind us and walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And walked to a different part in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> ...outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> where we had some friends of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Two older people and two daughters, friends of my parents and settled down there for that day and that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And that's how we left our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And I guess we didn't back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> until maybe June 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Interesting enough, my wife, Carla, was hidden in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that I that I had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And you'll get that story too of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Well, from here on, it becomes my story.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="428">ANSWER:  Well, I once...I need dates a little bit for my...these are only monthly dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They are not exact dates, but I need them for my own reference because it gets kind of confusing. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And I'm not so sure that this is even correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">In any case, 01:41: it's my guess that I stayed there about 3 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">The families was called the Nieuwenhuizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">He was an older gentleman who worked as an amanuensis at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">A very wonderful old man and his wife and they had a young daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And I stayed in a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">That first evening we dispersed. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">My little brothers went to my grandfather in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and I can't tell you much more about them from there on. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But those stories are all with my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">My parents went to some friends somewhere else near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And so that same evening we were all dispersed, and we didn't really get together again until after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">All of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">I was the only one who stayed at this address...at the Nieuwenhuizens, and I stayed there for about 3 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And all of a sudden, life was very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I had no more parents, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I had these very loving people, friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">But this was a strange business. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I had nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I mean I would sit there in this little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and read a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I fell in love with the girl, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">What else was there to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="451">She would have none of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">QUESTION:  Tell us about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  I can't tell you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">She was gorgeous. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">There were a couple...they must have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I don't know how this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">They must have been like in their 40s maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">They looked much older. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">They were like old people to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">They had this gorgeous young daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Beautiful, long hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I can't tell you very much about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I talked with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I tried to... See...how old was I? </span><span class="sentence" id="465">14. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I tried to get her into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">She wouldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I wouldn't know what to do with her probably, but anyway I was very much in love. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I was very lonely already right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I was there from what I could figure out till about January 1942 [43]. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I couldn't stay very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I couldn't stay very long anywhere really. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">My mother then sort of took over during...when we were all dispersed who started to pretty soon and arranged to find <span class="NPIP">places</span> for the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And this is the reason why she was later on caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">She was the one...the only one who traveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">She had a false identity card, just like mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And she traveled and found <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">She had contacts here and there I presume with the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I'm not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">But the second address I went to were friends of my father when he was a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So we're talking about...talking about 1942....we're talking about 19...between 1920 and 1925. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">He had lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">He'd been a musician. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I think he had been in love with one of the sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">There were three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Now they were all old and middle-aged ladies. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And somehow another they talked one of the ladies I think her name was Fie Troost, T-R-O-O-S-t, Troost into taking me. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Now remember the...the penalty for taking in Jews was death. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">That was for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So if you took some one 1n, if you were discovered that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">You forfeited your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">By this time I was, of course, a fugitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And I went to this Feetje Troost. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I think her name was Fietje Troost, and she lived together with another woman, a younger woman who was a receptionist at a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , and I settled in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I had a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I have a picture of that in the pictures that I gave you...the two ladies, and I have a view of the <span class="BUILDING">church tower</span> which I made a nice sketch of. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">My father used to sketch by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">He was always sort of amateur painter or sketcher and I sort of followed in his steps. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I liked the idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And I started sketching a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">So I sketched. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">01:46: I had nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Days went by with me sitting in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">But there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So I got my piano books, songs with piano books, and started practicing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> a couple hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I stayed with these ladies, and at night I would go out after dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I would take a small walk around the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Now in those days it was war time. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And everything was dark, blacked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">You know, there was a black out. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So it was a little easier to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and nobody could see you really. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">The <span class="DLF">streets</span> were pitch...pitch black. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">The only thing that you could see in the light was like little flashlight that people had and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> had little slits...you know, the head lights were blocked off, and little slits left open. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And so everything was very dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">So it was relatively safe to walk out, take a walk around the <span class="DLF">block</span> and get a little fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I also visited some of Fie's sisters....Fietje's sisters...this lady's sisters who lived about 15 minutes walk away in another part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Is it okay that I go into so much detail? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Bizarre things happened sometimes during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Here I was a fugitive kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I was 16 years old at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And I would walk over in the dark towards that other <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to this lady's sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">That lady's sister had a daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">She was a illegitimate child conceived by a German years and years ago before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">These lady's...since there was the mother, the sister of Fee and the daughter who was...about 20 is my guess, had always been kind of pro-German because the mother had conceived this child by a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And the child was half German in a sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">The child would be kind of attracted to German soldiers to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Not the common street soldier I think, but officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I was with these strange people. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">In addition, in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> they rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to a German officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">He was not a member of the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">He was a member of the railroad corps or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">The Germans liked uniforms so everybody had lots of uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">My father always said, "There's nothing a German likes more than uniforms.” </span><span class="sentence" id="535">This guy had a elaborate uniform, and actually all he was a clerk I presume or a little higher level clerk in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Of course, all the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> had been taken over by the Germans because this was vital to the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I'll tell you something bizarre which I'm ashamed at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">But it's some clowning around in that <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> where these ladies lived which by the way was a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement apartment</span> ...part of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I would I once donned the whole uniform of this officer, strutted around in his boots with his cap on and his black...sort of blackish dark blue and everybody applauded. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">They thought it was wonderful the way I looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I can't imagine 01:50: doing this now. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">But I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">They were very lovely. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">The dangers seems enormous at this point while I'm retelling it. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">To go to these people...their heart was in the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">They would have never said that they had a Jew visiting, because I was a son of an artist, Nardus, their childhood friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Anyway, I stayed with these ladies for ...[ have here from January 43 to July 43. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">That's my guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I'm not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Seems...everything seems much longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">But when I tried to schedule this out until the end of the war, I got in the end compressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">It was shorter than I thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">From there I'm not quite sure where we went, but I think what happened was that my parents...I should back track for a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">My parents wound up in the middle of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">They wound up for the better part of the war with a couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">He was an ex-Marine. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">She was a ex-cleaning lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And these people had taken my parents in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">So they were always in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">This is where my mother knitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">My father did sketching and went crazy sometimes because no matter how good the relations were, eventually some friction would ensue with all these people, four people in a tight <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Irritations set in. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">My parents decided that it would be wonderful if they could find a little <span class="BUILDING">summer place</span> for just a week to escape and just go like ordinary non-Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Stay a week somewhere in a little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">By the way, my father and I had dyed our hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">It was supposed to come out blonde. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">We dyed it with peroxide I remember except that I don't know how Pop came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I came out red. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">For the rest of the war, I had to keep this up by the way because in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> anybody who was not blonde and Dutch I mean you know, Jews you could almost pick them out from a crowd in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">There were no Italians. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">There weren't any Spanish-speaking people. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">The only sort of little bit outlandish looking...well, the darker looking people were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Not outlandish...darker looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">So, anyway we dyed our hair and...and Pop and my mother decided they'd go and rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">They rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in a little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in a very tiny hamlet called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lage Vuursche</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576"><span class="BUILDING">Lage Vuursche</span> was to play quite a role in my life, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="577"><span class="BUILDING">Lage Vuursche</span> was a little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">gas station</span> I think and five <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">It was very lovely. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">It was like a little hamlet in the middle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And Papa went and rented this rented this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for a week and moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">On sort of sideline this because it's important what my father and mother did at that point, they, as Pop told me later on, he said we weren't in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for more than 15 minutes and there was a knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and there was a policeman there. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And he said, "I want to talk with you people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And Papa and Mother knew that was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">They were caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">However, the man closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> behind him and sat down and said, "I want to tell you something.” </span><span class="sentence" id="587">He said, "I'm a policeman in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="588">He said, "And I can readily see that you are Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="589">He said, "I want to tell you where you should walk and where you should not walk.” </span><span class="sentence" id="590">He said, "I'll protect you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="591">He said, "If anything goes wrong, I'll tell you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="592">This is the man I showed you a picture of, a man sitting with his wife and a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">This is the policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I do not know his name anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">He was an angel to all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">From what I remember, I joined my father and mother...not in that <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> , but 1n a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ons Huis</span> (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="597">which was a sort of...I didn't know there were people like that then already, but they were people who were nature preservists. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">They had this...some did a little hiking, a little walking, and somehow or other my parents spent some time in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I went there too and we joined and I was for a little I don't know, maybe a week, but I can remember together with my parents in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Now, I had to go somewhere else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">QUESTION:  At that point, let's hold it. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">They're going to change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
ANSWER:  Great idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I would like to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">We can get started again. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Let's pick up where we left off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">We're now at July 1943 and after having spent maybe a week with my parents at this this nature lover's retreat...someone found a new <span class="NPIP">place</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Now, I don't know who. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">It's the first time that I went to work on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Now, you gotta realize I was a teenager from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I'd really never done any heavy physical work in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I was rather spoiled I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">My father and my mother I remember accompanying me not very far from this <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lage Vuursche</span> , this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hamlet</span> , to a <span class="DLF">road</span> that led into <span class="REGION">farm land</span> , grassy farm land, along a <span class="DLF">canal</span> and you went a couple of miles and you wound up at this tiny little <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Far away from really everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">That's how I remember it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And a <span class="DLF">Dutch farm</span> in that part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was very small and was all dairy and a few cows, and that's about all the <span class="DLF">farm</span> I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I don't remember him having a wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I have a feeling that he had. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Now this is the first that I was placed in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the farmer didn't know I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I was now from then on...I was a Christian kid from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where in the meantime food became less, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I mean it's harder to get and everything was rationed since the Germans stole every damn thing away. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And this was sort of like a pose I presume as a kid from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> who needed fattening up and he would work for his keep. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So here I was, of course, with my red hair and dropped off at this <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And the first thing I had to do was wear wooden shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Because that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is all I would say practically below water level I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">It was all green land, all meadows with..with every hundred yards or so little <span class="DLF">canals</span> to...to drain off the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">So wherever you went it was wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">First thing, I had to get pair of wooden shoes because that is the ideal wear in <span class="NPIP">places</span> like that so. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I remember I'm mentioning this because wooden shoes, if you're not used to them, they're <span class="NPIP">hell</span> on your feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">They will chafe open the upper part of your feet and your heels and this is what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">For about a week, I'd walk around with this blood in my...in these wooden shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">It's really okay for people who are used to it, but I got used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">You grow callouses very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I had to get up at 4 o'clock in the morning and milk cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I had to learn how to milk cows, then carry the, you know, 40 gallon cans to a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Put them in a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">row boat</span> , then row them down to the end of the <span class="DLF">canal</span> where I presume a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> would pick them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Other <span class="NPIP">parts</span> were cleaning out <span class="INT_SPACE">stables</span> spreading manure, mowing grassland, feeding the animals, and helping by the birth of one. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I remember pulling out a calf with ropes. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">For me it was <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">It was utter <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I mean I was only 16 or 17 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I had no parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I was in constant danger of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">By then I knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">One wrong word, one wrong move, one wrong clue and I would have had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Farmer would have said when(??)_ </span><span class="sentence" id="648">and he would have maybe denounced me. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Right? </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Would have maybe collected some reward for delivering a Jew to the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">So, it's in that time my mother said and she swore that I have said this several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I don't remember anything of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">My mother swore that during...especially during that time I wanted to give myself up. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I didn't want to hide anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I remember nothing of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">But my mother has...kept good records in her head usually so I believe and she wouldn't make this up. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">She said, "You were so desperate that you wanted to give yourself up and I kept saying to you...we kept saying to you, "It will pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">It will pass.” </span><span class="sentence" id="659">My mother had a little sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">It said, "This also will pass." </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So things were pretty grim then. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I was a very lonely kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I learned to work, but it wasn't easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">The farmer was very unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I was not much help in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I couldn't lift 40-gallon cans. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">You know...you gotta know how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I could barely walk in those God damn shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I wasn't there very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">From what I could find out, I must have been there from July 43 until September 43. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">In looking at the map, the <span class="DLF">farm</span> must have been in place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tienhoven</span> (7). </span><span class="sentence" id="672">It's the closest I can find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I don't remember the man's name. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I remember that we ate badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">He was very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">It was a poor little <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Where did I go from there? </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Let me see. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Yeah, it seems to me that from September 43 for about a month, I went to my Aunt Clara in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> where my cousin Hans lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I have two more cousins, Hans, Fritz, and Tony. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">They all lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> in a small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And I stayed with my Aunt Clara and I stayed with my Aunt Clara's in-laws, older people. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And I think it can't have been for very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">It can't have been mostly a couple of weeks or a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And...yes...[ remember being at my cousin Hans's grandfather and grandmother, my Aunt Clara's in-laws in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="686">They only lived a couple of <span class="DLF">streets</span> apart, so I could walk from the one to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And I was with these older people and they were very...very sweet. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">But they only would take me for a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">That was my.... They were scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">It was all scary. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">During that week, their son came to visit...my Aunt Clara's former husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">They had been divorced. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And I can remember he came unexpectedly and I threw myself under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And I was lying there and I saw these footsteps going...his shoes going by. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">But that whole period in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , that couple of weeks or whatever it was was very wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">It was with my family and my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">It was with my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">My cousin, Hans, and I would go out in the evening for a walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">In the daytime, of course, I was always indoors. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">In the evening we'd go and at night we'd go out and we would go to the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> and we'd sit in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">I had never been in my life in a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">So here was all this ceremony going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I thought that. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">They would come by with these censers and they...and the hats and all the...I thought I'd seen the Pope every time. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I said...I came back to my Aunt Clara, "I saw the Pope.” </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And she laughed. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">This was our entertainment. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">We'd go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and sit in the back in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pew</span> and watch the processions going. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">It it was a wonderful time, but we couldn't stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Everybody was dead scared, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">My Aunt who was Jewish herself, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Her children...the only thing that saved her I guess was her children were half Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">So I had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Now from my recollection what happened was that from there in October 1943, I went back with the help of this policeman to the Lage Vuursche, but not to that little <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where my parents had stayed for a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">The policeman had helped to I say build a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">underground resistance camp</span> , in one of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">It was right next to a Catholic, what do you call a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where nuns?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">QUESTION: <span class="BUILDING"> Convent</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Right next to a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">There was the <span class="DLF">fence</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and then there was...in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , you don't really have large <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lage Vuursche</span> at that time, they were like rectangles of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Not very high trees...<span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> maybe 50, 60 feet maybe at most or something you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">all planted...these were planted <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">In the middle of that, the resistance...members of the resistance had dug out a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">It was half underground and then covered with timbers and on the timbers sod and on top of the sod, grass and trees and plants. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">So that if you would stand right next to it, you wouldn't know it was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">The <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to it...well, there was one <span class="DLF">entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">It was sort of dug out was hidden by little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">pine trees</span> that were cut from some other <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> and put there so that...and footsteps were erased, so that you could stand almost in front of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and you wouldn't know there was anything there. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">The <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">underground resistance camp</span> was by a very cicuitous <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">It started if...1f you can visualize a rectangle...it started in one end and you sort of...it's a little bit like one of these puzzles...how to get out of the <span class="DLF">maze</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="732">It would swirl around and swirl around and then finally wind up in the center at this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="733">This was in order...also to not have a straight <span class="DLF">path</span> and not see footsteps and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">It was very cleverly done. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Food was and I must mention this wonderful... Food was delivered to us by the nuns of the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Food was delivered to us on their side of the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and we would lift it over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">It was a high <span class="DLF">fence</span> ...about a 6 or 8 foot high <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="738">We would...either we had cut an <span class="DLF">opening</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Warm food in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">It was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Nobody knew at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">The nuns didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">The <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="745">The only one who kept all the contact was the policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">He had to come back between the nuns and the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Now this man posed as a Nazi you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">This man had intimate contact with the Germans, who thought he was real hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">You see, there was a Dutch Nazi party called the NSB, The National Socialist Bond and he was a member of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">He posed very cleverly as a Nazi and played a dual role. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">His real heart was with us, I must say. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I was in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp I</span> do not know how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I tried to find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">It seemed to be me I can't have been there any longer than | to 3 months really. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">It seemed like a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">In that camp I was a non-active member because I was very young first of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Most of the members were grown up men. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And the only thing that I actively did there was when they would bring in English or American flying personnel that had been shot down somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> some of those they would convey to our underground hideout and I remember I spoke English for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Now I had lived, of course, for 3 years in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> when I was a little kid, like I told you but I spoke enough English for some...I can't recall how. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I learned some English in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I forgot. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I learned some English 1n <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and I guess probably what was still resided in the back of my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I was designated to find out if these guys were for real because the Nazi would sometimes pose fake flyers and and that discover members of the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So I was designated to sit with these men and interview them. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">You know, just like you're interviewing me now, but in a very casual manner and find out if they were real or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And I remember sitting up a whole night with a English navigator and a Canadian gunner to find out and they were real alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Because the Canadian gunner told me about he would hunt bears. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And their <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> __ somewhere in the north near the polar circle and he talked very real. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And the English was differently, told about his family and his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="771">So that's what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And the rest I don't know what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I guess I learned to play chess. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">We listened to classical music. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">We had...the members were all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> as far as denomination or whatever...religions. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">There was one communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">There was one very Christian man. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">There was a shoemaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">There was a bookkeeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And there were people who would come in and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Women, messengers nearby in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> were covered caches of guns and ammunition and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">They would go out on night raids and raid <span class="BUILDING">town halls</span> and <span class="BUILDING">city halls</span> for stamps such as you can see on my false identity card. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">So we had there a whole like <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they would also steal identify cards and they would falsify them. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">So this was sort of like a center like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Sometime my guess it was December...sometime during December 1943, our policeman...our friendly policeman gave the warning that he had heard rumors about a raid and it was decided by the members of the camp that we would post guards on the periphery near where the <span class="DLF">road</span> was...in shifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And it happened that a young man...shoemaker...and I got the shift from midnight until or maybe from 4 AM to 8...8 AM. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I think we had four hour shifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Everybody else was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">It was very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">It was very quiet in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">It was overcast. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">It was dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">It was 4 o'clock in the morning, 5. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">We heard noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">We heard like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> coming up the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and these little slits of lights and then we saw them come driving up the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Now we thought maybe they'd pass by. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Maybe it was just a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German convoy</span> going someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">But they stopped like 200 yards away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And they started to dismount. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">There were hundreds. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">They dismounted, they had dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">They had machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">They lined up in hundreds. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Their information was sketchy I presume. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">They didn't know what they were going to find. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">They knew there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resistance camp</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">They thought...maybe have thought find a couple hundred resistance men with...with guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">They came with searchlights. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">It was a big, big operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">As soon as we realized this was it, we ran back to this <span class="DLF">path</span> ...this crazy <span class="DLF">path</span> ...ran into the...into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> shouted at the top of our lungs, "The Germans...the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">They're coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">They're here. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">They're here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Well, it was pandemonium. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">You know, these guys trying to jump out of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> in pajamas and without pajamas trying to get into clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">We didn't stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">As soon as we realized that everybody had been, you know, knew what it was, we fled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And just as we were fled out of this rectangle of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , we saw the Germans coming from around the corner on that side and around the corner on this <span class="NPIP">side</span> , circling. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">So he and I...this young man who I don't know his name anymore, just ran into the next <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and into the next <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and into the next <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> , and we ran and ran and ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">We must have run for, I don't know, maybe three quarters of an hour till we were far, far away from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="821">We had made an agreement though...the members of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resistance camp</span> ...they were very well organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">They said if ever there's a raid we will meet again after it's over at a certain, particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> about 2 miles from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">This was the way it was organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">So we ran and ran and ran and we really didn't know where the hell to go and I said, "You know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="825">My father is taking painting lessons somewhere.” </span><span class="sentence" id="826">Pop you see we had a strange kind of hiding life. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Papa and my mother were hiding in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , but once a week Pop would get out on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> I think and peddle to this nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where there was a painter who gave him lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I'm not sure this...this painter knew he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">I think he probably did. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I know my brothers and I have paintings hanging on his mantle. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">So I have a painting by Mr.Schluter of all many other German names. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Mr. Schluter. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">It's a very good painting...Dutch painting. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">So I knew Pop was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">How I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I guess it was like a Wednesday or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">So I said, "Let's go there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="838">What I didn't realize at that point that I been so shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I'm sitting here, I'm still shocked now. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">At that point I didn't realize. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I was like just a boy running. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I thought, "Well, we ran and we made it.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Somehow or another I found this painter. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">This boy and I we came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">This young man and I, we came there and there was my father sitting and painting and very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And I said, "Pop, I got to talk with you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="847">He said, "Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I said, "Something terrible is happening.” </span><span class="sentence" id="849">He said, "What happened?" </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I said, "The Germans came for us.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="851">Oh," he said. "</span><span class="sentence" id="852">Well," he said, "You're here now.” </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Pop never understood things too well. "</span><span class="sentence" id="854">Well, you're here now. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Relax.” </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I said, "Yes, but all these men are there and they're all surrounded.” </span><span class="sentence" id="857">He said, "Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">What do you want to do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I said, "I don't know what to do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Christ, I was only...what was I...16, 17 years old boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I didn't know what the hell to do in this situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Nobody did ever tell if they later come with...as later on found half a division of men with search lights and dogs and machine guns and antt-aircraft...anti...1 mean anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">I mean...not to shoot down <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , but kind of, you know guns to...heavier stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">They didn't know what they would find. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I said, "Pop, we suppose to meet later on again after dark.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="866">Oh," he said, "Well, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Then stay here for a time and then you'll meet them after dark.” </span><span class="sentence" id="868">So we stayed there from all I can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Well, I was...you know, I was in shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Pop didn't know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Nobody else knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I didn't know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">It got dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Pop in the meantime, I guess, had gone back to his...peddled back to my mother's and gone into his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> again and he must have told my mother what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">My mother was much sharper, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Always was. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">It got dark, and this young man and I wandered back into what we didn't realize was a huge net which had been set up by the Germans...wondered back into this hugh circle and waited at this <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Nobody showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Except one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">My mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">She said to the young man and to me...she said, "We will just act like we are lovers. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">We will just be a threesome and we'll laugh and we'll act.” </span><span class="sentence" id="883">I said, "What about my gun?" </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I had a 9 millimeter Mauser pistol with me and so did he. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">We were armed. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">My mother took the guns and she buried them somewhere under a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and we got to a point where there was a German guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Then we laughed it up and we kissed and we hugged and he laughed and he let us through. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And I spent that first night...the boy I don't know where he went, but he went off some <span class="NPIP">place</span> else. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">I went with my parents to their <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , and spent a night...restless, every <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there...their <span class="NPIP">place</span> was right on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">Every time a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> came back I was like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">For years afterwards, every time a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> went by. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I stayed only one night there because they didn't dare to have me in addition, of course, and I went into a...I was I think again helped by this policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I went for a short while in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hilversum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">It's a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> of a notary public and his sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Lovely people. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Lived in a <span class="BUILDING">mansion</span> from what I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">It's probably larger...rather a large <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="898">They gave me a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with maid service. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Gave me a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with maid service, and it was just what I needed because there's a little picture in the group of small pictures of <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> that looks out on the <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="901">That was my view. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bookcase</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="903">I was growing up fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">By then, I wasn't anymore a boy I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">It's an interesting thing what happened to me there in that I came from a family that was terribly non-religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Matter of fact, my father hated anything that smacked of religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">He always felt that priests and ministers and rabbis were all the same breed and organized religion was <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , and he didn't want to have anything to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I never was religious either. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">I didn't know anything about being Jewish very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">I was in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and there was a Bible in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bookcase</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="911">It was a Bible for reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">A nice big edition. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I'd never read a word in the Bible in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">I thought it would be interesting to...as I said, I said I was growing up fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I thought maybe I should read something, and something philosophical. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">I grabbed the Bible. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I opened it. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I opened it onto one of the prophets. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I think Jeremiah. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And what I read was, 'and you shall try to sell yourself and nobody will want to buy you, and you shall try to hide and nobody...nobody will take you.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And on and on and on it went. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And I said, "Gees, this is my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">This is me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="924">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I got instant religion, I got instant...1t was not instant. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">I read through the whole Old Testament. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">It was a revelation to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Something to hold on to. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">All of a sudden, here was my people. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">This is my history. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And I pledged...I pledged to God if he would save all my family, I would be religious to the end of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I'm ashamed to say I didn't keep the promise. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I tried to keep it for some years after the war, but it slowly leaked away, especially after I found out that God had let 6 million others perish. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Anyway, I got instant religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And I got a Bible. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">I got a Bible. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">I think I got it for free from the Bible Society. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And I carried that Bible with me from there on wherever I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">I went from that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...I went back to farming. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">But in better <span class="DLF">farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="941">I went from December...We're now at December 43 and I must have been there a few weeks in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , maybe a month and I recuperated to a great extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">At least the jitters left me. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I had been very close to death I realized. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And I went out to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I don't know if the policeman again helped me there with the first <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="946">It may well have been because I have the feeling these people knew I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">This was an entirely different kind of <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="948">This was in the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> more...this was a rotund <span class="DLF">farm</span> with rotund wife and three rotund daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">Big apple cheeks, just like you expect farmers to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And they were jolly people, and they were friendly and they ate well. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And by this time, I also knew how to work better. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">You know, I again cleaned <span class="INT_SPACE">stables</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="953">I milked cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I got very good at milking. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I could milk 14 head of cow in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">You know, I went from that <span class="DLF">farm</span> to another <span class="DLF">farm</span> and there I got the shock of my life one morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And everywhere I went I read the Bible, which worked excellently because these people didn't know I was Jewish, and they thought I was a very Christian boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Little did they know I only read the Old Testament. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Whatever... I slept like Dutch farm hands do in a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a straw...bag with straw...straw in it, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And right in with the animals portion of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="961">I was used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">One morning I woke up I heard German voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I thought this 1s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Again, this is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">German voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">However...I mean it was like dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">I tell this now you know.... Well, let me finish this first. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">It was like dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">All they came to do is steal a couple of head of cattle. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">They had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and they carried them off you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I thought it was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">This is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">This is me. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">You know, as I am telling you it seemed to me that I was in good shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">However, I have been for...the last 22 years in psychotherapy and I tell this story very often over and over again to my psychiatrist. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">That on those <span class="DLF">farms</span> I trained myself to such an extent to forget things that if I would walk from here to the <span class="DLF">door</span> if you had asked me at the <span class="DLF">door</span> where did you come from, I wouldn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">If you ask me where did you go, I would say to the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">But beyond that, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">I lived in like a tiny segment of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I presume that the past and the possible future were too awful to contemplate so that... It was a strange thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">Anyway, I worked on these <span class="DLF">farms</span> and I worked very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">The last <span class="DLF">farm</span> I worked got to be winter from all I could find. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">Well, now it...from December 1943 to what I figure is August 44, I worked on <span class="DLF">farms</span> as a farm hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">I would actually go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> where I worked and register at the <span class="BUILDING">town hall</span> with my false identify card, which is quite dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">If I would have run into someone who would have recognized what the signs of a false identify card was, I would have been caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">However, they would register me. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">These were Dutch clerks, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">My brothers were somewhere...I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">On one of the <span class="DLF">farms</span> my...one of my brothers...my brother, At, came over for a week and stayed with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">He was billed as Ed's brother who came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> who also needed some fattening up. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Actually, he came from some <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> that I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">My brother could tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">My parents were still in their own...in their little <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">But my mother had a plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">She did a lot of traveling around taking care of <span class="NPIP">places</span> for my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">My brother, Fred, almost died here. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">I don't know...he had pneumonia, and nobody took care of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">She found him with high fever somewhere, got him to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="999">You see, my mother did all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">She traveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">My mother had a plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">She had a plan for summer of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">She would rent a little <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> , and she would spend it together with my father there as people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> who came to rent a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> for the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Like you would do any <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And my two brothers would come there too at times, and would be like having her children around her for a little bit my mother said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">And as she traveled toward my brother...let me not lose track of the time, we're now talking spring of 1944, May 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">I was working on <span class="DLF">farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">My brothers were in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , spread around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">My parents were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soest</span> with those two people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">My brother traveled toward my brother or came back from my brother in the south, again arranging another <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which was...my brother, At, was a very difficult child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">He was a very nervous child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">It was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">He would wet his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And people wouldn't have anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And it was all very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">I think those boys also went as Christian boys by the way, not just Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">They had to pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">They learned to pray and, you know, all this stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">My mother on her way back in May 44...I think it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span> , somewhere in a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> ran into a Gestapo character, green police member who could recognize falsified identify cards, nabbed her and sent her to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dutch concentration camp</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">From there, she was shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> in the fall of 44. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">I was at the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Pop decided that the little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had been rented already by my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">He might as well go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">He went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">My two little brothers were delivered there by an aunt of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">My father had two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">I'm not quite clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">At some point, we visited them because they were now not very far from where I was working on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , about an hour bicycling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">So I visited them, and decided Pop needs helps with these two boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">By this time I was a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">I had been working on <span class="DLF">farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">I'd been laughing at jokes about Jews at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">breakfast table</span> with farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">I had learned my lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">And I decided Pop needed help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">So I gave up my job at the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">bicycled and joined my father and my two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">I guess this is around August 44. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">And that's how four of us spent the ending of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Minus my mother, of course, who we knew now had been shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">We still didn't know that they were destroying Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">We still didn't know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">We knew there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">We didn't know they were killing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">May 44, my mother was caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">We spent the winter of 44 in this tiny little <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> of which you have a drawing of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">We installed a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> when it got to be winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">The owner of the <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> lived right next door in a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> didn't know we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">He thought we were family from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> who didn't have enough to eat anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">By this time things were getting very desperate in Holland. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">And he was no friend of ours because, as Pop told me, one of the first days that he was in this <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> this gentleman said to him, "Mr. Lessing, would you like to take a walk and I'll show you the property. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">I have many fruit trees and so on.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">And Pop said, "Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">Sure.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">And acted very civilized and took a walk around and as they were walking, the gentleman meandered in talking about the war situation which could hardly help because it had been going on then for about 4, 5 years and he said, "It's a terrible situation with the war.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">My father said, "No doubt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">No doubt.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">And he said, "Those Germans," he said, "they are terrible.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="1058">No doubt," said my father, "no doubt.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="1059">They are almost as bad as the Jews.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="1060">No doubt," said my father, "no doubt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">You said it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">We then proceeded to steal every Goddamn thing we could find on his <span class="REGION">property</span> and sell it to the farmers in the <span class="REGION">area</span> to get bread so I mean I felt so sorry about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">This man had interesting then...a natural fruit, no artificial fertilizers, nothing...no sprays...natural fruit farm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">He had thousands of of these what you call these...these glass jars in which you preserve...preserve fruits in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Farmers wanted those very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">We sold them by the hundreds and survived the war there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">It's a long story that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">I don't know how much time I still have to tell you, but to tell you stories about that little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1069">QUESTION:  Tell us some.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1070">ANSWER:  Some. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">I'll tell you some of the interesting highlights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">Since there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> in this little <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> , we put a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">Anything was on a very heavy protest of the gentleman next door. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">But we said, "Well, we don't want to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">We put in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">We needed fuel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">Every night my father and I would go out to a nearby <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> where they had high <span class="ENV_FEATURES">pine trees</span> and with our little saw we would cut apart one of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">pine trees</span> and then cut of the branches and spread them around so it wasn't too... We'd go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> so you wouldn't see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">We'd carry this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> on our shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">We had shoulder pads specially made, carried it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we cut it up into portions and the next day we would split it and we would cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">We didn't have salt, so my father found that the farmers had on the corners of their meadows, bit blocks of salt for the cows to lick on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">They called it cow licks I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">And we'd steal those, and we'd break those in pieces and hammer them down and then boil them in water and then out of that sediment, we'd boil away and out of that we'd have salt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">We got the news from the nearby <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where there many people hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">And so every night we go and listen to radio Orange so we got the news from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">One morning I woke up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">There was something draped over the <span class="DLF">window</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">A huge orange parachute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">We're talking now about probably November 44. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">I went out the little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and looked around and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was covered with parachutes and containers with...as I opened one...guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">I thought, "This is trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">This is trouble for us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">Radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">Shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">Uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">Everything dropped for the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">Miss dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Dropped in the wrong <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">Soon the Germans showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">I was still...I presume...too...too adventurous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">I stole a parachute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">I figured we could make blouses out of it or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">You know, everything was pretty desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">Clothing, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">I took a parachute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">The goddamn Germans counted the containers and the parachutes and came to our little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and said, "We're missing a parachute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">If it isn't back here within a half hour, we shoot the four of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">I just brought the parachute back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">They left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">They were really Wehrmacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">They were really army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">They were...come to persecute Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">However, I still had hidden a container with a friend of mine under a... There's a container had fallen under a tree trunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">That <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> had fallen over in a storm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">They never found it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">So we had some English cigarettes and we had chocolates. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">We had a couple of things for a little while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">The winter of 44 was very harsh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">We ran out of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">We went begging for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">My brothers we went begging for sandwiches, which was sometimes funny too but I won't go into detail unless I still have time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">But we went begging for sandwiches and we went begging for grain and then we would out of the grain make boiled bread and so on and we were far better off than some of the people in the west of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">At least we could get our hands on some foods. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And we stayed there in the very harsh winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">My father and I made a trip by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> to some of the <span class="DLF">farms</span> where I had worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And we got a couple of eggs and a quart of milk and carried it all back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And so my brothers worked too...went out begging for grain when they were thrashing..when there was a thrashing machine nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And so the winter went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And we burned up <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> got pretty thin, and then came the spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And it came a tremendous noise and firing and guns and we said, "This is it." </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">It was Arnhem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">No, sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">Got it mixed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">That was in the fall, 44. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Tremendous firing of guns and we said, "This 1s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">Freedom! </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">They're coming.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arnhem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And they got defeated as you probably know, and everything stopped for the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">But then in the spring, in April, the end of April...I think the beginning of May...May was always an important month for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">Everything happened in May. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">My birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">The Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">My mother got caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">We just found out that my mother is still alive, again in May. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">Then in May, noise came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Firing started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Grenades started flying over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Explosions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">It was war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And we were in the center of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">So we had a <span class="DLF">dugout</span> where we could hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And I don't know if there's enough time? </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Is there still enough time for a little story?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1156">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1157">ANSWER:  Because this 1s a cute story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">I don't want to miss it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Not everything is so heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">This is a cute story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">The farmers around us...we lived...the little <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> was actually in the middle of <span class="REGION">farm country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">There were little <span class="DLF">farms</span> around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">The farmers never gave us anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">We would ask them for some bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">Naw, we ain't got bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">We had to go a little further away and beg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">As the firing came nearer and nearer, branches started falling off the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , bullets whizzing around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">Just like you see in a wild west movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">One of the farmers came over and said, "You want a duck?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">My father said, "A duck? </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">A real duck?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="1172">Yeah," you want a duck?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="1173">Yeah," said my father, "I want a duck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">Sure.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">He said, "Okay, here's a duck.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">We got this duck which was riddled with shrapnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">It had been hit by a grenade or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">Anyway, we took the pieces of steel out and we put it in the fire and started frying the duck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">The fighting got so heavy though that my Pop sent the boys...my brothers into the <span class="DLF">dugout</span> with that gentleman with his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">And we didn't want to leave the duck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I mean a duck, we hadn't eaten any meat for God knows how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">So the duck was doing okay, but the fire was getting lower so, the stuff was breezing right around our... So finally the duck was done, and we crawled on our bellies, Pop holding the pot with the duck toward the <span class="DLF">dugout</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And we were in this <span class="DLF">underground dugout</span> for two days and two nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">This shell fire was <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">It was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">I mean it...it just <span class="DLF">holes</span> like, you know, the size of a good size <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> were dug right around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And it stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">We heard voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">Oh, my God, this is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">German voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">Two German soldiers with machine guns going right over our <span class="DLF">dugout</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">It's the last Germans I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">The last Germans in uniform I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">I don't know where they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">Firing started up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">It lasted for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Silence again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">I said to Pop, "Let's go out and see what's happening.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Pop and I walked out of the <span class="DLF">dugout</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">We got in front and I can't demonstrate this here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">We stood up and we both went ____ right to our knees on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">The nerve shattering...I mean the firing of these...these projectiles whizzing around you howling and exploding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">I could just imagine what soldiers go through 1n the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">It had shaken us so much we couldn't we couldn't stand up for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">But to make a long story short, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">Soon <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> were rattling by with big white stars on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">And we stood at the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and we waved and these guys said, "Hi.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">I said, "Why aren't they happy?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">I mean this...we cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">We stood there crying at these...at these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> went by and we couldn't believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Of course, we thought maybe they're Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">There not happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Now these guys were in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">So it was not a bad day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">Some more resistance of the Germans, but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was liberated...the nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ...of 4,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And Pop almost got killed the last minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">Pop almost got killed during.. when the firing stopped, he said, "We should be able to get some food.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">Now there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">communal kitchen</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where we would go every day and get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> with some slop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">And he said, "We should go there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">I said, "Pop, I don't think...you know, it's just after the battle.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">He said, "I should go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">We have to eat something.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">So he went and came back very pale. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">He said he had gone to the edge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> with two guys with machine guns post in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and he had to rattle his way on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">In those days there were no more tires that had air in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">So we made tires out of old car tires. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">We cut strips of old car tires. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">But, of course, this was solid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">It was like driving on <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">I mean it was like the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> rattled and made a horrendous noise, so these two Canadian soldiers must have heard him coming from a mile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">But they were on their alert, and he rattled right in front of them and he pointed the machine gun on him and said, "Who the hell are you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">He said, "I'm going for some food.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">He said, "Get the fuck off the <span class="DLF">street</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">And he passed by and he came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">And that was the second time in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">At the beginning and the end he almost got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">So after that, we got liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">I will tell you one small, funny incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">We had nothing to eat very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">So Pop decided...I had found some...my brothers and I found some German objects...a helmet and instruction book to go with a gun, a couple of crazy things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">Pop said, "You know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">Maybe we could trade with Canadians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">These are souvenirs.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">So we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Canadian camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">By now we were surrounded by Canadians, all settled down in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And a whole division settled down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">Pop was simply amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">He went there and he said, "You want a German helmet.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">The guy said, "Yeah.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">He says, "Well, we'd like to have some coffee.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="1252">Well," he said, "here's a pot of coffee.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="1253">We got this nice instruction book.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="1254">Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">Well, we'll give you five cans of...of of spam for that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">And so we traded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">And we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and there was a detachment of military police. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">Big, strapping guys, with red mustaches, and big helmets and MP on it you know, and on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Harley Davidson</span> 's and Pop said "Can I trade anything for sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">We have no sugar.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">This guy said, "Well, he said, "We haven't got sugar right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">If you come back tomorrow morning, he said, we'll give you some " And he went back the next morning and they were just packing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">And he said...my father said, "Hey, you told me I could get some sugar.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">You know, they were revving up these big Harley Davidsons' you know, and they're going to move the whole division. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">You know, these guys...these guys division so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">He said, "By the way...big mustache, red haired guy, huge, said, Youa Jew?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Pop instinctively said, "No, of course, I'm not a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">We had come through years of hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">He said, "That's too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">I only give food to Jews because I'm Jewish myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">Bye.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">And zoomed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">So this was this was the fortune. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">Well, to wind it up, we found transportation back on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">Got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> , Pop went to <span class="BUILDING">town hall</span> and said, "I used to have a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">17 <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">And they said, "Thank God, somebody came back.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="1278">What do you want?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">he said. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1280">You want a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="1281">Yeah, we need a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .” "</span><span class="sentence" id="1282">So, we'll give you a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">Let's take you around" He said, "Now this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was from this Nazi and this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from this Nazi.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And they gave us a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and then they said, "What do you do for living.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">Pop said, "I'm a music teacher.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="1286">So, what do you teach?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="1287">I teach cello and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">He says, "I'll give you a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">Here's 15 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pianos</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">They had taken everything from the Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">We got everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">A whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> set up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">Now, I'll back track for a second to May the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">We're liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">What happened to my mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">One of the first weeks that we were liberated...there was no transportation, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , no...the only thing that was going was the Canadian army, all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">Pop got on his old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barneveld</span> a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to find... He had heard there was a <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross station</span> there that gave information about people, missing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">And he went there and I understand as Pop said it the exact day that my mother was called, they found her on the list in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philipsville</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Algeria</span> ina <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">Well, that story's my mother's really, but she told me later or she told us later that she was in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> and she was very sick and she tried...sick at heart and... She didn't have typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">People were dying left and right around her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">She had maintained she was an American citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">The minute she was caught...says, "I'm a American citizen and you have no right to arrest me and me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">They interviewed her at length. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Since we had lived for 3 years in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , she knew how to describe <span class="DLF">streets</span> , <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">It was all God knows 25 years old or something, but they seemed to believe her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">My mother sometimes was like a little psychic it seems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">She could predict people coming to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">She said, "I had a dream in which somebody held up a newspaper, and on the newspaper it said January 15th, and I woke up and I thought I had to remember that date. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">That's important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">On January 15th, she was put on...on a transport and exchanged for German prisoners with another bunch of Dutch Jews, went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> where many of them still died, and from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> I guess to <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> to ____ whatever, and wound up in <span class="COUNTRY">Algeria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">And some months after we had been settled in this <span class="BUILDING">Nazi house</span> , former Nazi house, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> ...it was...1t was dusk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">You couldn't see too well anymore, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> stopped...an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army truck</span> stopped in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which, by then, wasn't anything very...very extraordinary because they were English and American and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Canadian army trucks</span> all around and my brothers had been made mascots of the Israel soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> stopped and a woman in a jumpsuit, very tanned, looked at me and said, "Oh, could you tell me where the Lessings live.”

class="sentence" id="1318">We were all back together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">We were all back together again for a little while because pretty soon, of course, I guess maybe a year later or so, Pop and I went to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">We had reapplied for a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">Mother stayed behind with my two brothers and came over a year later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">But I had...1n the meantime, I'd joined the Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">Thanks to the the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span> which was a brigade within the 8th English army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">These soldiers came over with a patch with a Star of David on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">These men did everything to rehabilitate us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">They settled...first we had Canadians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">Then we had some English soldiers taking care of a bunch of German prisoners of war who were in a nearby camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">Then the Jewish soldiers came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">And my two brothers, my two little brothers said, "There's Jewish soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">They're Jewish soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">They have the Star of David on their arm.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">And we said, "There's no such thing.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="1333">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">We found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">It was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">But my brothers went to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and there was two soldiers in the English fashion standing guard, pacing back and forth, turning back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">He had this Jewish Star. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">And my brothers wanted to make contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">They didn't know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">And my older brother who always was very ingenious said, "Let's sing a song.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">And he started to sing Maoz Tsur Yeshuati. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">One of the guards stopped and said, "Hey, you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">Over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">Are you Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">Are you Jewish?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">He said, "Yes.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="1348">Come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">They became their mascots. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Trucks</span> would stop full of soldiers and say, "Are the boys here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">And then the boys would come down and "Oh, we take to over here and there," and take them on trips. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">My mother came back and I said, "Mother, there are Jewish soldiers here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">And you know what she said? "</span><span class="sentence" id="1354">I never want to see a Jew again in my life.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">Two weeks later she was singing...I think it was .1t was New Years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">It was Rosh Hashanah or maybe it was Purim or some festival. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">And she'd changed her mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">She was singing Jewish songs to 46 soldiers.</span></p>
