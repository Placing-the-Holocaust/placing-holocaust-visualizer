<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  I need you to start off by telling me your name, place of birth, and date of birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name David Kochalski. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called , and I was born May 5, 1928.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Well, we were very hard working, six children, father and mother and we had a small <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> , flour, buckwheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">We were not prosperous but comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Did you go to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  I went to two <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">One was a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">In the afternoon I went to a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> until almost late at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  So your family was fairly religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  And Judaism was important to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Well, I raised in the spirit of Judaism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Now, when you went to the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> you had a lot of friends who were not Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  No, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> itself, in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , was segregated between Catholics and Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Mind you, it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and I would say the majority of the people in that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , somehow, I don't know why, but they separated us Jewish children and Catholic children. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">As you know, most of the people in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were Catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Did you have friends who were Catholics?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Yes, I used to have friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  Did you feel any anti-semitism growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I felt it, maybe not personally, but I knew of a lot of incidents whereby either they were small little -- I would call 1t -- we were separated, in other words, but hardly got together, and there were incidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Incidents, not pleasant incidents, because we were called in from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , people regardless of how religious we were, did not believe that we were really religious people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Were there any incidents with your brothers or sisters that you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  No, other than we were a lovely family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Were there a lot of cultural or social organizations, political organizations in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Yes there were Zionists in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">There were Socialists, there were Communists, even though at that time Communists had to go underground, and religious institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  Were your parents active in the Zionist movement?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  My parents were, I would say, Zionists, and very religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  What did you know about Hitler and the rise of Nazism before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  I was aware what was going on even though I was a very young youngster. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">My father used to subscribe to many newspapers, Jewish in origin and non-Jewish papers, papers that had nothing to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">However, my father and my brother and all the rest of them we used to discuss those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">They used to discuss and I used to listen, and I knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">In fact, I remember when they were chasing out Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , who were of Polish origin, my father took in some of them, a couple of them, to stay with them because they came out of there with nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">They really went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> amongst Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">There were so many of them that people had to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So, I was aware, until the war, very much aware, what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  They told stories of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Definitely, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">In a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , since it was more or less a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , in other words, we did not speak Jewish there, it was Polish, history, everything was Polish, and the guy who was --what do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="44">He was not Polish, the guy who was running the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , he was not Jewish, he was Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">In other words, he was a Catholic, so we were aware amongst us kids, because sometimes we were not greeted in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Did you have any idea what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> might come to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Yes, because people were aware that eventually Hitler will overrun <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">It was known between people that he's not going to stop at that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">He had great -- in other words, he had great expansion ideas, and he asked the Polish government to give him almost everything they needed, or wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So, we knew it was going to be sooner or later. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">A few days before the war they already had black outs in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , because at that time, I would say the Russians and the Poles signed an agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">It was about a week before the war, and everyone was aware that there will be a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We did not know the particulars of what they signed. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">The Germans, the <span class="COUNTRY">USSR</span> , we anticipated there would be a war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Was there anything that the community did in preparation for this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">The Jewish people naturally were very anxious. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">They already knew what happened to the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They were thrown out. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">They already heard of the burnings of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and everything, but they really thought it will pass if the Germans come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">It will pass, and Jewish people really believed that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was going to be defeated. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">We were aware and the preparation was made in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">People used to hoard food and everything, because they knew he was going to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">They had certain memories, Jewish people had certain memories of World War I where it really was benign. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and it was benign. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">In other words, the occupation, they were not harsh on Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">On the other end, Jews were very friendly because our language, the Jewish language resembled German, so there were a lot of Germans in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">They used to speak Jewish too, or Jews spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">So, the Jews kind of figured it will go over. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Maybe the war will take a little longer, but it's not going to be that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">They did not expect anything very bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Do you remember what the Catholic population was thinking? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Were they eager for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to come in? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Were they prepared to fight them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  At that time, it was more or less, I would say a partnership between Jews and Catholics, because they had a history, the catholics had a bad history of German occupations. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">The Jews already knew what was going to happen, that they are putting Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">That they are really against Jews, the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So, naturally at that point they were united.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Do you remember the day that was occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  What I remember is one morning, I think it was on a Friday, we were all sleeping and all of a sudden, a great bang in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">A bomb was thrown. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">We did not know it was a bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We all ran out and we saw <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> going over. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">There was near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , not far from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were German garrison (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They tried to bomb the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> but they missed. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">They bombed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">At that time, radios whatever you could hear, they announced already that the war had begun.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  They tried to bomb a <span class="BUILDING">German garrison</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  No, it was a Polish Army garrison, which from what I guess, they wanted to bomb, but they probably missed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Do you remember what was going on at this point? </span><span class="sentence" id="91">You went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , you realized there had been a bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">What did you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">What were people doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Panic, immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">There was great panic in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">People did not know what to do, to stay in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or escape to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">My parents they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">All the six children and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">My father was in the militia. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He was a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They took him in the militia to watch black outs. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Once the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> came they either threw out -- they didn't throw them out, but they let go certain soldiers in parachutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">His aim, my father's aim, was to watch that a black outs and there were some people who came in there to bomb some <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So my father was there, and my mother was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Finally, my mother got very lonely or she was afraid that something was going to happen to my father, since he wasn't far, so she took me and we went back to that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> at that time was not spared, but they did not come yet, the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  So, what happened after this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  I went back with that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">My mother stayed with my father, otherwise he was in the Reserves, the Military Reserves, but she watched after him and I was around there and watched after the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> , which we had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  It was still going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">All of sudden we heard that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was surrounded, and here my mother and father were very anxious because five children were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We heard that the Germans surrounded them and the artillery is going, and there was no food because there were more than a million people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">My father and mother decided that I should go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> to help the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So, they loaded me up with flour, food, but it was very tough, tough for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  You were talking about you were going to take some food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  I had to take some food to help because starvation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> my mother and father heard about. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And you know, they have four children left helter skeltor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So, they loaded me up with all kinds of food and they said, maybe he'll make it even though <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was surrounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">It was very heavy what they put on, and I remember my father and mother, my mother would say to my father, maybe we'll never see him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But I guess the urge to help the children was greater and my father kind of looked at me and probably thought the same way, will I go through it, because there were horses and people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> massacred, killed on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">In other words, out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> the Germans would also throw in a bomb, artillery, bombed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Many people would walk through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> you would see carnage. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So, my mother kind of kissed me and says who knows if I'll ever see him to my father, and my father clenched his hand and I turned around and I walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I never saw them again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  How do you know what happened to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Well, I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , that same day <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> capitulated. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I want to tell you first. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I made it into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">It was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">It was very hard, but when I came <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was surrounded there was a time they had what you call -- they stopped fighting to collect the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The Germans were fighting the Poles, the Polish Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">They were surrounding them and of course, the Polish Army had some fierce resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">However, there was a time when they got the Red Cross or whatever, they arranged a one hour to get the dead out of the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Germans and Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">At that time, kids like us could go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I made it and somehow when I came to a certain <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , since they bombarded the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> with artillery, I had flour in the bag and a piece of shrapnel went in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">The flour, we got out of it, but we had other food. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">The flour went on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and I made it and I brought it to my brother and sisters, because there was starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Artillery, there were people killed, burned, fire was all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">However, the Poles at that time they put up a tremendous heroic, what do you call it -- heroic resistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  How old were you at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  I think I remember I was 12 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  How far was the distance between your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  Not far.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  Did you walk or on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  Only walking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  How long would it normally take to walk?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  It didn't take a day, I want you to know, because the carnage on the way was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">The artillery we had to go at midnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Somehow I think it took two and half, three days until I made it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">It was like an inferno. </span><span class="sentence" id="154"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was an inferno.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  Weren't you frightened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  What do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I certainly was frightened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  You were a little boy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  I was frightened because there were fires and we never knew running through the <span class="DLF">street</span> whether the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> would collapse. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And on top of it, since I was a little boy, after delivery I was told by the Polish Army, and rightly so, to help dig ditches in case the Germans advance. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They called anybody who could do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I was frightened, that's the answer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  When you were carrying all these goods to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , at this time you were asked to help dig ditches?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  I helped do what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  The Polish people, the Polish Army dig the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  The Army in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was preparing ditches against <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , in case they advanced so any able bodied, any kid, anybody that could see on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , they made him come and do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  Were you traveling alone or with people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  A party of one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit of what happened next, you made it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  Well, there was starvation, and the worst thing there was no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">We were hiding in <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It was really mayhem. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">People would stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> for bread, and artillery would just mow them down and kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">It was an inferno, fires all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">The funny thing, it was during the Jewish holiday, but Jews no matter what it is, what is was, whoever had enough religious upbringing would hide in the underground and have the services. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Some of them stayed down there and were buried alive by the artillery. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Not just artillery, but <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , where they would just circle the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and fire whoever they saw or just at random at any <span class="BUILDING">building</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  Did you attend any of these services?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">No, I was impatient. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I would have liked to go back, but somehow -- I had other problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We had no water and there was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and we were all running for water, to drink water. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">That's a very terrible deal when you have no water, and it was also very dangerous because there were not the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">At that time they were shooting the people who came for water. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">So, some of them never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I was very little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  Did you see the shooting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Well, certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It wasn't shooting especially, it was bombarding, you know from the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I either get trapped or I ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">IfI get trapped, then I wait there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  What else can you describe about conditions at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  Jewish people were very scared at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I think, or I heard that most of the bombardment at that time was directed to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarter</span> , most of the bombardment and I guess Jews were very much congregated in one <span class="REGION">area</span> and the Germans were aware -- in fact they were aware of everything, but this in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  Were you hiding in this Jewish area?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  Yes, I was hiding in the Jewish area wherever I could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">QUESTION:  Do you have any remembrance of any Polish catholic people you knew at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Did your relationship with them change or did you separate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  I think it was very much -- there were cold sufferers and they used to meet at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> if they get water, and it didn't make at that point in time, it didn't make any difference whether you were Jewish, Polish, catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">At that point we were all Poles against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I want you to know the Jews were more interested to fight the Germans because they knew that they anticipated bad days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  How did that relationship start to change?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="425">ANSWER:  It was completely different. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">The task of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> was we should be more or less responsible even economically for everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">They used to send children like to <span class="BUILDING">barbers</span> where they cleaned up. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">They used to send people to shoemakers they should help. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They used to send people out, the little older boys, because they were up to 15, 16, some of them even had a little children. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Normally in Europe, if a kid finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , he became an apprentice somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So, people used to make money, kids used to make money and they would take the money and buy food. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">In other words, you almost had to be self sufficient.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">QUESTION:  What kind of work did you do?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  Do you want to tell me about your other jobs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  You keep asking me because the last job was the job where I could not come back to the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  So, let's talk more about the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">So, you remember, this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> were you accepted a little more or were you still --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  It was more responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">We were older kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">We were reading newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And I want you to know, it went like a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">In this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> you had the biggest I would say doctors, the Germans as a rule tried to kill whether they were Poles or Jews all the intelligent, all the professors, doctors and <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> , all of them, so at this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> we had even though we knew who they were, but we had the very educated, most educated of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and surrounding. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">They were professors, they were the chief rabbis of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">They were they liked me, one guy wanted the best chore. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">There were other professors who were hiding there. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">They were cleaning, they were cooking in order not to be discovered by these Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And since they worked in <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> , I don't think the Germans checked too well. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">There were a few times they took out some. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So, at night we were not allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- when night came after supper, what I know now how education goes, we had a terrific lectures on everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">In other words, it was something like a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">All the boys would sit down and they would give us lectures in history, Jewish history and then they would always give us geography and any other arithmetic every other night another professor would start teaching us. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Then the rabbi would teach us Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">It was like a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> .</span></p>

ANSWER:  I don't know anything about before the war, but I'll tell you they did not they couldn't get into our <span class="NPIP">place</span> because the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , the <span class="REGION">area</span> was very small and we had 30 40 people in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I don't think they could absorb more but they did not have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for them.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  What they tried to do 1n this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , they tried to make human beings out of us under the worst circumstances because inside we were like an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Outside it was <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , a real <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">People were dying of starvation and even in the beginning they were dying of starvation, people some of their parents left for <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , left the wife with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">It was very bad <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Here you tried to organize it in such a way that everyone either worked or if you couldn't find work give him a trade <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Little kids became shoe makers, cabinet makers. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">They brought up old tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  You said that you had other jobs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  Yes, and this was my downfall. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I had other jobs where they used to send me I guess what happened is I wasn't strong enough to pull the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> so they sent me they had other jobs, to send me to people in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> where they were making clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">But my last job, that was my downfall. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">That was my downfall. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">They sent me to a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I had to go at 5:00 in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">You had to go with the German sentries. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">If they wanted to warm themselves up, they would chase me around just for exercise. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">They would chase me around and around and made me run. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">It was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So, I went through it was a problem in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> a big <span class="BUILDING">foundry</span> , a big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> run by Germans and some Jews who before the war were foremen. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I used to get up in the morning hoping that I would get to eat something. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">But somehow they didn't give me any food and the job was very horrid. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I had to pick up 30 or 40 pounds of burned up steel and throw them into the fire walking on the . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I was very week. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I couldn't do the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I was always thinking to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">It was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">So eventually some Polish people who worked with me, they give me a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I was still hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">The <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> -- the people were still sleeping while I was going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I wasn't the only one, in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> they woke up early. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So, around noon time -- this was my downfall, maybe you should understand, I was very hungry, hard work for now I know for a boy was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I had to walk up with a load of 40 or 50 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Finally around noon time it wasn't arranged for me to have food and the Poles give me a little bread but they didn't have themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">They were working people, hard working people, and I explained I came from the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> because I had to keep up with them and I couldn't keep up. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I think I was about 14 years old, and I wasn't too strong either. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">So, they took pity on me and they helped me a little bit, but I was still hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">What my downfall is, it started with a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">These people who ran the <span class="NPIP">place</span> they had their own big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">They were German soldiers and German civilians because most of this was going for the armaments. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">They were making presses there and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Somehow they were always happened, but I noticed that the dog gets a lot of food after lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">The dog got a lot of food but I couldn't reach it. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Everytime I went by I wanted to grab something. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Finally I got acquainted over a week or two he would finish eating I would grab some. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">He was happy, and it was good stuff for the dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I ate it and I felt good. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So one day, I could always get after he was finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">If not, he would growl. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">That was one day one of the foreman, I don't know if he was Jewish or non-Jewish, came out and grabbed me and slapped me and hit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">You go taking away the food of the dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Don't you get enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I was working there for two weeks, I had no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Nevertheless, he called a couple of other Germans over and he shamed me in front of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Because I know it wasn't the first time I got hurt that way, but , he had <span class="BUILDING">engineering place</span> , all kinds of instruments and a Polish engineer was there and he started hitting me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Aren't you ashamed he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">You're a Jewish boy, to do those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">When he hit me very hard, I got very excited and figured that's the end of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I grabbed a inch by inch a steel ruler and I grabbed it instantly without thinking and hit him in the glasses and I think I blinded him. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I could run through before the assessment checked by paper I was gone already anyhow, but I had legitimate papers anyhow to go from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , and I was afraid to go back in. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Then my little brother came out at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I was I think sleeping over at my brother's. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">He said, don't go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">The Jewish police are looking for you and if you go in there you might compromise the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I don't know to this day what happened to that man, but I know the glasses and blood was running out. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">From then on I became what we call in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , a wild boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">My brother didn't have enough food, so to tell you it was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I used to wake up 5:00 in the morning hoping there would be a lot of dead people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Hoping I don't know maybe it was just that I wanted to live, but everyday hundreds of people would lay down and die. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">They couldn't either take it anymore or sick or just froze to death or gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I used to wake up 5:00 in the morning, I wasn't the only one I want you to know, and kind of stuffed my hands in the pockets of those half dead or dead people and whatever bread -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> everybody you couldn't go away without a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I got a piece of bread here, a piece of bread here. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Sometimes a dead person I would even take off a watch too, to help myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">That's how I got breakfast, and some of it I had for lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Some of the time I was beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">They used to smuggle in potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">If something fell I would grab and they would run after me and beat the hell out of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Hygiene, very dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">You go around desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">So, finally I decided I'm going to go out to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I didn't run away but to go out for some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">One incident I want to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">So, the situation was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Children, especially elderly people would be laying down there dead either of typhus or any other sickness or just frozen to death because they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay or they gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I decided with other kids we're going to take a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">They used to take out groups to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> so we were to get in there and as soon as we passed, the Germans did not especially check those who went out, they only checked those who came back, so we used to go and beg for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">One time, very early, I and two more friends, I'm sorry do you want me to tell you this is just the gist of one event. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">We're trying to get in and beg for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">We have learned already a little bit how to greet catholic people in their way. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So, it was about a four or five story <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and right after the curfew we got in there the superintendent opened there's a certain <span class="DLF">gate</span> , and each one of us went to a different <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">A woman looks and me and I try to cross myself and say whatever I knew and say what I had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">She said to me, "Look, you don't have to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I know who you are." </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I probably wasn't the first boy to beg for food, but she was all messed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">A nice woman and the first thing she asked me to take off my clothes and she prepared some hot water and especially we had so many lice on us they were eating us alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">We did not look good. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">That's how they recognized us anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">So, she said don't worry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Take it off and I'll burn it. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I will cook it. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Then she was cooking for me something like buckwheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And they were poor themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">She didn't have anything to give other than to cook something. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And I was hungrier than <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">She sat down with me and I think she was a good woman, but all of a sudden she started talking religion to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">She said it's such a pity that you Jewish children can not go to <span class="NPIP">kingdom of heaven</span> and he had to bring Hitler a man, the destroyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I kind of looked at her and I figured I was brought up religious in other ways, but I figured she's good, so I said okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Well, I understand, but what can we do we're hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">All of a sudden we were sitting down there and I didn't eat yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I hear a shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">The superintendent of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> must have called up the police, the local police and I looked down and one of my friends was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">He was shot in the leg and he fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I didn't know what happened yet to the guy on the second <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , but that woman, we realized first I said hide me somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So, she took me in a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> , in Europe they have, like you have hear, where you hang your clothes, inside they have <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and she put me in there and she locked me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">She covered me with all kinds of furs, whatever was in there and took the key out and went to the neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">She was afraid that if they catch me down there, they'll kill her too. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So, she went to the neighbors, and I was lucky she took out the key with her so I didn't have any <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I was holding my nose against, and I was sweating and I thought this is the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">They'll probably ask the other kid on the second floor what happened, where I am who is the other one because the superintendent saw three kids coming, three Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Well, I was there, running was water, I thought this is the end of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I couldn't breath. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I think I passed out for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">All of a sudden I hear a scream and I thought it was German, but it wasn't, it was a husband and coming back and screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">He was a good man, he says look you have to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">He was a railroad man, but don't suffocate him. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">When they took me out, I didn't go out, I fell out. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">But he was a good man, and he hid me with neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Gave me new clothes because my clothes were wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">He was still cooking and food and everything and at night he took me through because he worked with the German Army and he was very connected with the police and I went through with a lot of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">He gave me food and everything I brought in I think two weeks I ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I had food for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">What I'm trying to tell you is an accident again, I had to hide because the other kid was beaten to <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , almost dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">The guy on the second floor. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I don't know what happened to the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> whether they took him back to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I never met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">This kid, the other one, told on me and again I had to change clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I had to make myself all kind of dirty things on it because I was cleaned up already, and they didn't recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">But I was sought again by the Jewish police because the German gave him the description, who Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Finally I think it's impossible for me to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I am going to die there. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I went over to my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I didn't even bother telling my younger brother, because we were close. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I said to my older brother, I said look I want on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , some of them recognized, some of them didn't recognize. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I am going to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Whatever happens, happens, but I'm not going to die here like the rest of the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So, he says look, tell me something, you go because there's no hope here. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I'll take you through. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">The way they took through people was they went to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they could squeeze me, but he was already an educated guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">He belonged to a group they were revisionists, a group, a Zionist group and I guess he was more or less in underground already. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">They had certain connections with people in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> so he kind of drew up a map for me if I get over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">He drew up amap. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">You take this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> going. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">There was a rive in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> which goes through the whole <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">When you hit under the try to go across and we have connections with these people who are saving Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">So, he gave me a map and everything, gave me a few dollars, whatever he had and whatever I had, not much, and to go and get a ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I walked out of the group which went to work and ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I want to tell you, he helped me, my brother he gave me whatever money he had. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">He bought a little jacket for me and a little hat and proper shoes, not too good but shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I went out there and I went to get a ticket and I went to get a ticket and I hesitated, I was moving back, because there was a <span class="DLF">line</span> of people, to go or not to go, because I think only older people go and I was just a little kid in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">So, I moved out, all of sudden, with a German he asked me he says to me he grabbed me he says listen to me, don't go in there in German they said they'll you. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">They will finish you off in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I pretended I didn't know a word of German. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So I was saying again in Czech again. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">He got mad and he started talking in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">He knew both languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">He said you get the hell away from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">They will kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I have an idea after today, he was an angel and he saved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">But where do I go. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I had a map, about a journey of two days hit the in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and 1 don't know where to go so I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Central Station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Central Station</span> but my heart was pumping. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I didn't know whether they would recognize me, if they want to recognize me, but it looked like nobody paid attention to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I had a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">This was early in the morning when I got out, and where do you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Finally, I was afraid to go because to go into that <span class="DLF">Central Station entrance</span> because there were so many German SS around there checking for ; which means you had to have some kind of a -- something who you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">They called them , and I had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Where do you go, so I was just roaming around the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I reminded myself my father used to go once in a while took me with him to a rabbi, a big they had those semitic groups and they used to he was maybe 60 kilometers outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="697">But they had a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">It wasn't large rails and small and it sort of dragged into that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">So I said maybe down there there won't be so many soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And sure enough, I went down there, it was near dusk, I figured if it get a little dusk nobody will recognize me anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">So, I got up, but I was afraid to buy a ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I got up without a ticket and I figured if they catch me I'll take out some money and give the conductor. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">They weren't Germans, they were just Polish workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">So, I sat down amongst the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">They were smugglers. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">They would smuggle in food to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and buy clothes there. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">This was their job. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">So amongst them I sat between them they asked me where do you come from? </span><span class="sentence" id="709">What are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I told them, listen my father was a soldier -- I made it up-- I father was in the army and he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I am looking for my mother because my father lived in the <span class="REGION">German occupied area</span> and my mother took off and she's supposed to be around this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">So, they started giving me salami, food, anything what I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">When the conductor came he, they said you don't touch that kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">In other words, they felt sorry for me because my father was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I don't know how I got that idea, but it came into me the last minute when I asked me what am I doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I didn't have a ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I was still scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">When the rail -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> slowed down and the front of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> 1t was called and in the front of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> there were a lot of Germans waiting I guess checking on those people who were smuggling and when it was slowing up, it was dark already, and I jumped off. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Where do you go now? </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I was just running in the direction of the end of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Dark, I went through a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> up to here, and down across was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and I didn't know, you wouldn't believe it, I was hoping to God and I was sorry I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I was real sorry, because I didn't know where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">It was dark, cold, wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I couldn't sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">In the morning some elderly lady, a woman, was carrying a can of milk to distribute. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I asked here where am I. I spoke very good Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I was very good at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">She says, first she gave me a little bit milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">She says you're so wet, what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I said I got in in that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and I don't know where -- I got lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">There's a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Varka</span> (ph), not far, you go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I think it was Sunday morning, I figured I'm going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">What do you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I went to that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in the morning and the sun came out and I dried out and I see all the people are going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , so I went down there to. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I was afraid to stay behind someone else's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I seen a lot of those very old ladies sat down begging and people would give them. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">I sat down too, but on the side I wanted to dry out. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">One woman came over and said, "What are you doing little boy here between all these old people?" </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I said I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I haven't got any money and I have a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">My father was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I used it, I knew it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">My father was killed -- they took out pieces of bread they gave me. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Other people said this was an orphan. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">His father was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">They gave me bread and little pieces of sausage. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">In the meantime I dried out and they gave me a few dollars, a few . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">The first few dollars I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">They were selling crosses down there in front of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I gave the few dollars to that guy, and I got myself a very large size of across. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I figured it's going to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And I continued that day, I stuck around in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I went again, I was afraid to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I was always worried if they ar going to recognize me or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">I figured if I keep going, I'll be dried out. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">It's a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">So, I went through like a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> the German firm was cutting <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , I think for the <span class="DLF">coal mines</span> , the <span class="DLF">mines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">There was a sign that was two days later -- there was sign whoever works will get so many marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">In the <span class="BUILDING">mill</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> they had like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> there and it wasn't army. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">These were people, 1t was a company with Germans who were preparing those <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , and a lot of Poles were working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I went over and I asked for ajob. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I asked for a job and the woman she spoke German and Polish you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">To the German she spoke German, to me she spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Don't you think you're a little bit too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">You had to be sixteen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">But I was very skinny too on top of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Don't you think you're too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">You can't work because you're too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">So, one of the other Germans, a foreman said, and I understood what he was saying, tell me you'll take him in and they'll let him clean up around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Clean up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I'm telling you, as soon as she said can you clean a little bit, nobody ever cleaned better than I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I did a good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Then she asked me do you have anything to show who you are? </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I gave the same story, my father was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I came from a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="REGION">North Poland</span> , and I have got nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">She said, "I'll tell you what. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">You work here next week. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I'll go with you to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">We'll make a photograph of you, a picture and then I'll send it into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they'll bring you a work card. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">I don't know, I think luck was with me at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">When she said I can have a work card, and she was good to me, because I really washed and cleaned and helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">It so happened I got a work card, and I worked there for quite a while, maybe five or six weeks, until they liquidated the <span class="BUILDING">work place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="782">We cut enough <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">They hauled them away in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">They hauled them away in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Now, where do you go now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">QUESTION:  Had you changed your name for the work card?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">ANSWER:  Why certainly, at that time my name was , with a W. I figured I can't keep my real name. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I had to have a Polish name, a Christian Name, and they used to call me , So I didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Where do you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Finally, they were asking, I went to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I already had a few dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">The foreman gave me money. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I was a polishing their boots, they had some horses, I was cleaning the horses, so I had quite a few marks at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">So, I went to a small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and then they had a sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I stayed by people. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">They slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and they told me there's a place where they're looking for hands, working hands to help on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And I have to go to the head of the <span class="REGION">area</span> , who was naturally a German, a commandant and these people used to come and take the workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">They wanted them to have a lot of workers, because they were supplying food for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">The Germans were confiscating food at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">So, I came into a big <span class="NPIP">place</span> there, and I registered my name take a look I got working papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">They didn't ask me any questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And a guy on a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> took me to his <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and I had to start working on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="803">They didn't know who I was, whether I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I had certain problems there. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">After a week or two I had to go to confession. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Now, my father never went to confession, my grandfather neither, and I didn't know what to say either. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I understood what it's all about because the son of the owner had to go and went with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">We went later than the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">He went in down there and I'm telling you my heart is just pumping, what am I going to tell the priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">What do you tell a priest, you know, I didn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I never did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">Somehow I heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I was so scared I put my ear to the little <span class="DLF">entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="814">It was a little bit ajar and I understood what he said and I asked him, he said just tell him that you didn't do anything wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I went in there and repeated the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I repeated the same thing and somehow it didn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">He took me out, it was a man I would say over eighty for sure, a priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And he asked me, tell me your parents were not from the old religion , L understood that if you didn't say they were not Jews I understood right away that he was not such a bad man. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">If he would have been a bad man and said they were not Jews, but somehow he was very delicate about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I asked what kind of people are those , he kind of winked at me and said if you don't know, you don't know, but an old man wore those long robes, and I think, today, he recognized me, I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">I did not do the right thing I know it, but he took advantage of me later, you know every time I had to clean up behind him in his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , he made me do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">Tape #3
QUESTION:  When we stopped, you were telling me about the priest who sort of recognized you but didn't acknowledge you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="823">ANSWER:  He was a very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">He never bothered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">I think he recognized me and I did some chores for him so I didn't have to go back to confessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">On a whole he was a heck of a nice man, because I used to go every other Sunday to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And I worked on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and I did anything people had to do on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and of course, since I was not used to it, it was horrid, but I was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I had food. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">The people down there treated me well. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I worked -- I think I ran out of work and to the best of my recollection I needed money because I didn't get too much money from the men but they gave me food, clothes, very nice catholic people. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">So, I worked for a baker. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">I went to work in a small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> not far. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">A little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for a baker, the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Garbutka</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Working for the baker, he was a very nice man, and I worked all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">From what I can recollect, that's the first time I found out of the Holocaust with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Once we were through we sat down <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">It was like it wasn't even daybreak yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went down not far. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went down there not far from there and he said you know something, these Germans are going to pay, and they're going to pay heavily for the kind of barbarism they are doing now. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">He told me in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">He was mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">He was a good man, and he said, you know something, these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> which you see going through, they are burning people alive and getting them through the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> and Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">I heard that and everything inside of me started shaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">I did not believe it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I didn't believe it that this could happen, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">They're burning -- I looked at him but I said I got very good information that that's what they do to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">One day they will pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I was uneasy already, very uneasy. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And I heard, not far from there there was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was --what they did the Germans got together shoemakers, what do you call it, tailors, other let's say people who were good in certain trades. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">They got them together, and they worked for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">This was already after they liquidated most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> , and these people were living maybe a couple hundred of them and one man a shoemaker used to come to me the baker and he used to hide his shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I think he recognized me that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">A very nice man, and he told me about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Ghetto</span> , because he used to get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , all the shoes, bring them into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , make some money and brought them back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , made some money and came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">One day, being in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , something must have happened some provocation or something, the Polish people around there were doing something, the underground which wasn't to the Gestapo liking. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">They must have done something bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I didn't know anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">All of a sudden, I want to tell you something, my mother comes to my <span class="NPIP">dream</span> she says listen -- everytime something happened bad my mother came to my <span class="NPIP">dream</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">She said in the morning you run away from there, and with that kind of thought I wake up and I , they are shooting people all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="860">They are shooting people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I kind of remember, but it was hard to escape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">QUESTION:  Who and why were they shooting in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">ANSWER:  What I'm trying to tell you is they had some kind --from what I know now, I didn't know then, there was a provocation, the underground, the Polish underground probably robbed or took a lot of food out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> which went to the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">So they brought some kind of punishment, a company of Ukrainian all kinds of real butchers and they started killing people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="865">I look out and the priest was even taken in chains. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I was looking out and I figured I'm going to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And I think I was running better than Tarzan and I ran, but the wheat was that high and in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> they did not have big <span class="DLF">estates</span> , just small little parcels of <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="868">So, in between there was one parcel of <span class="REGION">land</span> and the other, there was what they called in Polish , like little <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and they were having a guns machine guns down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Anything moves, boom. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I got in between and I want to tell you I was going and I figured this is the end, and I kind of ducked every minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">After they shot, I got through. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I finally got through and where do I go now. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">I remind myself about that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I'm going to run there, and it was about a couple kilometers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I was running away in my shorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">My whole body was full of blood from I was on my chest walking on my chest because I was afraid if I put my head up that was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Well, I finally reached that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they let me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">The Jewish people were watching themselves too. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">They didn't know yet, but they had an idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">They heard all the shooting and I told them what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I told them listen I'm Jewish let me into this group, and I told him about that man who used to hold my shoes down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Sure enough they went in there and he came in and took me into his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="883">It was very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I was a stranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Everybody was sleeping yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">His wife, he woke up his wife to wash me up, because I was full of blood, and I was sitting figuring, what kind of life was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I was really disgusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I could have been killed a couple hours ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">All of a sudden I seen the same German marching in on this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">I was a stranger and sitting behind the <span class="DLF">door</span> and people were still sleeping behind every little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> seven Germans, SS men would stand there, their guns pulled out and one of them, all of a sudden I saw that this must be the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">But I was behind the <span class="DLF">door</span> , a stranger, and they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="892">They went to every <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and all of a sudden one of them walks in and said all the men out. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I never knew that so many men were in one little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">This guy -- so I look out through that <span class="DLF">window</span> , through that <span class="DLF">opening</span> , boom. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Everybody that walks out boom, got a bullet right in the back of the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">At that moment, you wouldn't believe it, I saw myself dying there, and I saw a film in front me, all my life, I saw like a fast film, my life and I figured this is it there where I lay. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Now, I turned into glue, I tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">There was no escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">One guy was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> chasing out and the rest of them were shooting, one by one, in every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in front of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">The German who was chasing out, took me by my back and pulled me and I didn't give a damn. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I knew I'm going to be dead and I was half conscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">So, there was one of them in the front a tall SS man. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">I don't know what happened but he turns me around and says in German , he's a little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">He looked me in the eyes and go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">I want to go back, but I'll never forget that guy who chased out everybody from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a big German like this, and assessment aren't you killed yet? </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I started begging him. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">He didn't shoot <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , he was holding the gun like that, but the women all of a sudden they saw what was happening they tore me out of his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">The women, because they -- they killed some women, I found out later, those who resisted killing their husbands or their sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">Somehow there was scattering all those Germans so this German let them tear me out and he went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to shoot others and they told me in this little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , the Germans were not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">They tore off the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I go in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">There was a lady there who started crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">To the other women you brought us an angle of death to me, that I am going to spoil it for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And they had a a little <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and one <span class="NPIP">side</span> was a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> about three by three. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">They must have been hiding food or something because it wasn't very deep and the old man, the woman's husband was shaking he was afraid to go down. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">He was an old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And I got the idea if he go down I'll go down with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">There was no escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">These two girls, one that mentioned, the two girls one of them didn't let me in and the other one said let him in. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Finally they pushed the father in because the SS, the Germans were running around looking for men to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">They got him, but the elder sister didn't let me in, so I kind of got in, the girl pushed her away. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I got in with my head down and my feet up. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">There wasn't enough <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> and I held the old man like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">When they saw the Germans approaching, they closed it, closed it very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">They went and the Jewish people did resist at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">They were looking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">I think they were scared themselves too. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">They were shooting in one <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> if someone is not there, then the other <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> , and I laid between and the little girl said I want to go with my Grandpa to that little <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> and then I passed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I honestly don't remember having any conscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">I don't remember until about four hours later, these two girls with another woman they pulled me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">They pulled up their father. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">The people were killed already. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I could hardly regain my consciousness because my head was whirling. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">I didn't know whether I was still alive or I'm dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">They pulled me out and there was a heap of dead people, like 120. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">They pushed me in between and I took some and I bloodied myself to make sure that the women had to go, they disappeared, most the SS went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">They did their job, cruelly. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">I was laying between the dead and a couple of old local Germans were to write down how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">They pushed me up, I pretended I was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">I was waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">They took the women to dig a big <span class="DLF">ditch</span> for their husband and they put all kinds of lime in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">That's what 1 heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Then the women came back and they put us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I was almost night, and they put us on a big horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="946">All the dead, I pretended I was dead too. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">They left a couple of Jewish policeman or ordinals, they left them alive, they helped pull it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">One of them squeezed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">I knew that he knew that I was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">When we went somewhere I remember because after the war I went to take a look down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">I was only about 100 meters from the big <span class="DLF">ditch</span> , and we made a turn after I decided to jump off. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">I don't think anybody did any shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Nobody did any shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I didn't know where I'm going. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">My head was whirling. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">All night I was running like a dead person. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">I didn't know where I was going and what's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Until I finally saw a little man and I told him that I worked for this guy and this guy in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where I worked for the baker, so they gave me some clothes and they washed me, another farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">That's how I survived this massacre.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">QUESTION:  What was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Ghetto</span> was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="962">ANSWER:  It's called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Garbutka</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">QUESTION:  Did you have any sense when this was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="964">ANSWER:  It was somewhere around either July or August 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">At that time, we heard, because I related that that they were killing older Jews, or killing all the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">That's how I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Anyhow, that's was the event, and that's why I told you off camera about this girl, that woman who saved me is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montreal</span> today, and I recognized it two years ago in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">QUESTION:  The woman in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">ANSWER:  The woman who helped me get into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="970">She had another sister who did not want me to get in there because they wanted to save their father. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">Anyhow I got out of this mayhem and I went to work for another -- I think 1t was again a smaller little farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">I was afraid to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Eventually I went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , but what happened is I ran into another small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they took me to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="974">This was some kind of a camp for Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">There was some Jews too. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">Not far was called . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">I think I was working there only two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Also, they surrounded the people but supervision was done by Russian P.O.W.s and they were working on -- they were crushing stone to make some kind of a -- to go through some kind of a <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">My job was -- again I was a little boy so they put me on a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> to hold the two -- to kind of brake and somehow I forgot my way and instead of braking I pulled the thing and naturally the guy, the foreman, he was German, started jumping and threatening me, and hitting me and bleeding me. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">He says I'll take care of you tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I want to tell you, an hour later I said I have to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , bloody, and I kept on walking and I escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">That was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I wasn't long there, a couple of weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">Then I remember another event when I was in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and there I really literally found out about the holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">We were taken to work down there near a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and every week a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would come from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> enclosed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , they had some wires across and there was a bag for water, and all the boys, including me, we were running to get some water, because these people I knew they were Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">They were screaming in Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">They couldn't talk Polish, half German, but they were from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And they threw gold and money and give you water. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">My heart was just the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I was crying to myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">What the heck is going on, and I knew which direction they were going already. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">The whole families and they were crying and looking through the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">Of course I didn't care about the money but some of the kids cared about the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">I didn't want to be different. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">I picked up too. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">This was going on for a few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">Every Thursday a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would come and I was waiting with water and other boys were waiting with water too, for money, some of them I felt very sorry for those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">One day, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> comes and I waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">This was just an event I must tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">I'm holding a bucket of water and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> comes but not that kind of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , opened, and German police not SS, but police were talking to these people, stop the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">They always had to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I don't know whether they had to fill up with water, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> , so it stopped and I looked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Believe me I hold the bucket of water for I thought first class, all Germans and they talked to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">I was smart enough to know which is an SS man, which is a policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">I had a kind of education over the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">So, I was educated in this respect, so I go ahead and I take a look at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I hide my water and take a look what's going on and I look in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">They were wearing medals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">There were beautiful people, , so a German, I hesitated, he's going to get like everybody ten marks get in there and bring him the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I took the water out and I started giving they had like little <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">I walked over to one man and he was religious, religious Jews were they called it, and I recognized that he's Jewish and all of a sudden I look at the rest of the people and all of a sudden I knew they were Jewish, because the guy who was the head, a little guy next to him, he asked me in German , So I told me slowly , Means a <span class="NPIP">killing place</span> in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">So, I kind of mentioned him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">But I was very scared saying it when they said , | just jumped off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with my empty bucket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">I spilled the water and I ran as far as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">I know my heart was crying because I knew in a couple two or three hours nothing will be out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">They must have been VIPs from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">Some of them had medals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">In other words some of them must have been soldiers in the Austrian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">This was the last time I went through to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I was really afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">But when I found out at this time really about the Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1021">QUESTION:  How did you or anybody else know where these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1022">ANSWER:  Where I'm going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1023">QUESTION:  No, how did you know where these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were heading?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1024">ANSWER:  I told you the first time I found out the truth the baker, he told me that in this direction, goes down there to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called and from there it goes down to and they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">The local population knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">They were witnessing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">I don't think they were happy the Polish people regardless of their feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">They still knew that human beings are being burned alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">I saw in the eyes of my baker, catholic, I saw he was very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">He said one day they are going to pay for that crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">I couldn't say I was Jewish, but my heart and everything in me was whirling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">I really didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">But slowly after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and also there were runaways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">Jews were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Those who jumped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">I can't go into in this interview all of the particulars, but there were incidents -- there were incidents where I saw Russian escapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">I gave them bread, anything we had because somehow they were begging for food because they escaped and most of them were caught anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">But the Russians were really, really treated bad by that time, the Russian POWs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">They used tell me some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">I worked in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and they would somehow run through those <span class="DLF">fields</span> and ask me if I could bring in a piece of bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1041">QUESTION:  Was there any effort by the Polish people to sabotage this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1042">ANSWER:  From what I knew, do you mean sabotage the Jewish problem or sabotage against the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1043">QUESTION:  Against the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1044">ANSWER:  There was quite a bit, I want you to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">From what I know and from what I observed the Polish people were very patriotic, and they hated the Germans regardless and let me tell you the Germans, the SS, they did not treat the Poles nicely, not even nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">They were killing them off quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">They were killing them off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And they had their underground, which was run through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and some of them, most of them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> by us were hiding and we were hiding all kinds of guns and ammunition and I used to be chased out sometimes in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to find out what time the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> goes to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to the front, because sometimes this underground would jump on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , but on the edge of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and steal whatever they could, food, ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">So, the Poles, they were putting up a hell of a resistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1050">QUESTION:  Were you aware of any specific incidents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1051">ANSWER:  Where they put on a resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">Not a specific but I knew and I saw because the people I worked for, they were really engaged in that underground activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">I wasn't on a specific did anything specifically because I was young.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1054">QUESTION:  How long did you go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> hiding out as a catholic boy?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1060">ANSWER:  Hiding through the rest of the war 1s the answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">I was never free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">I either was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> or I was hiding <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">I was not hiding because I had to hide, I was hiding because I was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">Just about I would say a year before the end of the year, the Polish resistance was very great, and I was scared at that time they grabbed all youth I was scared they were going to recognize me, so I escaped from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">I went back to where the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was, not far, and I was hiding personally because there was another problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">Amy boy whether they were Jewish or not Jewish, any boy was either arrested to kill because the Poles had an uprising in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and the people they I would say the Polish army was gathering to go help the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">I was afraid that they were going to -- I was with them really, it was called at that time ,a Polish Army, but I didn't want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and I was afraid they were really mobiling young kids to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">However, I escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">I was more afraid that they were going to recognize me that I'm not Jewish, because being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> somehow I knew the people, but strangers, groups, underground there were all kinds of people and some of them were they were very good and recognizing Jews, I want you to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">So, I escaped the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and then I was hiding wherever I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">But his was the real way I was saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">I was hiding in the haystack and all of a sudden I see two guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">I was with another fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">Not to be killed the Germans were after him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Germans SS, Gestapo, they had all kinds of you know, people who were looking to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">So, I was hiding and all of a sudden I seen two guys whom I recognized they worked in the <span class="BUILDING">gun powder factory</span> and they escaped from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">One guy knew the <span class="REGION">area</span> very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">He's the one who practically saved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">He's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">I was just with him in . </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">His name is Silverman He knew the <span class="REGION">area</span> and we tried to get across the <span class="DLF">lines</span> , the <span class="DLF">lines</span> meaning the Russians were advancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">We were on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">The artillery was just unbearable from the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">We tried to get through the to go to the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> , but it was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">There were virtually hordes of German army which they retreated to this other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> so we couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">They had another <span class="DLF">line</span> which they were preparing in case they had to retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">So, we were between the first <span class="DLF">line</span> and the <span class="DLF">second line</span> of the German defense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">It was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">It was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">I used to inside I did not look Jewish, I used to go out and somehow organize bread and water and we made <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , deep <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , winter, deep <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> and we begged, we got some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">We were hungry all the time and that's how until the Army came across. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">It's a little harder for me, but it didn't take long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">It was very hard because the German army with their dogs and all that they were retreating and they at that point they didn't especially care who they killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">If we were in their way between both <span class="DLF">lines</span> and that's how eventually I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">I think it's enough for me now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">I'm getting tired.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1097">QUESTION:  Can I just ask you a couple general questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1098">ANSWER:  There's still a lot more for me to say, but it's very hard for me to go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1099">QUESTION:  Did you go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1100">ANSWER:  Why certainly.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1108">QUESTION:  You were liberated by the Russian army, when was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1109">ANSWER:  I didn't see the Russians, but that was about the time somewhere in 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1110">QUESTION:  Did you in the time you were hiding, did you feel terribly isolated that you knew you had to be safe that you had to be a catholic boy, but you knew that you're people were somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Was that a strange feeling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1112">ANSWER:  Well, number one it was I wasn't too smart to think about those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">I was trying to save myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">I knew that I'd never see my brothers and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">That I knew, yet the will to live and to one day survive and like now to tell people, it was a certain thought of it and I was lucky.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1116">QUESTION:  How did you feel about being Jewish at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1117">ANSWER:  Well, let me tell you, I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> for quite a while, but whenever I could avoid, could avoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">I never heard because the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> never teaches anything harsh against Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">I just felt strange amongst it because I was brought up in a Jewish religion, so I let it go by what the priests say with a grain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">Let it go, okay, some of it I absorbed and some of it I forgot and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">But I felt Jewish --not that I felt Jewish, I felt very scared every time I went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and maybe they could recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">I felt Jewish, all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1123">QUESTION:  You didn't resent being Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1124">ANSWER:  I was resenting a lot of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">There were times when they took kids, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , they took them to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I was very scared because I was circumcised and I thought that whenever they had something like that surround and take the kids to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , I was hiding and very fast because they used to say they take them a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> and because the Germans wanted only healthy people, so somewhere near they would take them to quarantine and checked whether they don't have any t.b. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">They wanted healthy people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">So I was afraid if I was going to undress before doctors, they'll recognize that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">So, I was very sure, at the risk of my life to escape those situations where they couldn't catch me to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">Funny thing, sometimes I figured I could have gone because one of my neighbor boy was caught then he escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> he told me didn't have anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">They took us straight in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">It would have been easier for me if I would have gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">I was aware that I was circumcised. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">Every moment of the day, it hit me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1134">QUESTION:  After the war, were you eager to be Jewish again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1135">ANSWER:  Let me tell you, during the war, I really thought that God as a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">I thought they'll never be defeated, the kind of cruelties, the way they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">I would say the SS and all the Gestapo and all the apparatus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">I will tell you, you would never they were barbarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">They were not human beings, these people who were running <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">The SS, the Gestapo, and all kinds of other names they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">I knew how strong they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">To say that I was glad to be Jewish, I want to tell you something, and this is the truth, I was just mad a my God, first of all mad at my father that he made me a Jew, and mad at my God that we had to suffer so much, what for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">That was my first feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">A lot of time I talked to God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">When you get desperate you start talking to something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">You've got nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">I would just put my eyes up and I asked why, why wasn't I born a dog, a bird who could jump over the <span class="DLF">Ghetto walls</span> or a catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Why was I Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And there were times when I was really thinking that it's not good for me to be a Jew, if I ever live and if I have children, I said to myself, I would never let them be circumcised because this is just showing the enemy that you're not the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1150">QUESTION:  After the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1151">ANSWER:  Well, when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , of course, in American I found out that I would not circumcise my kids if it wouldn't be that they said in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> they are circumcising everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">I got married and my in-laws they were Jewish too, and I let them circumcise my two sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">If I were to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in Europe, I would never let my kids by circumcise, in fact I would even try to be a non-Jew, because what for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1155">QUESTION:  I guess did it take you a while to readjust to being a Jew again after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1156">ANSWER:  Believe me, I knew I was Jewish, because there was some persecution in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> too, after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And some of them came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or those who survived never made it even amongst the Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">There were some Poles who were not happy yet with Jews surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">I wouldn't say some, majority were just people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1160">QUESTION:  You're tired aren't you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">Do you want to stop?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1162">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1163">QUESTION:  After you were liberated, where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1164">ANSWER:  Eventually a year later I escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and made my way to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1165">QUESTION:  Right afterward did you go back to your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to see if you knew anybody?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1166">ANSWER:  Definitely I went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">I was looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">I was trying to find out if anybody's 1s alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">I know they're not, but maybe, of course, I was trying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">I went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and I even put my name in on certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> because I was afraid I was taken into the ARmy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">I was afraid that somehow my sister by the writing on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> knew that I'm alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">She came back from <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1174">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1175">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you think should be recorded about this whole experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1176">ANSWER:  To record I could just tell you one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">The worst for me was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">It was worse than <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">You couldn't imagine -- <span class="NPIP">hell</span> was worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">I can't imagine that the people could be surrounded, not fed, children my age and worse was smaller children, were just laying in the <span class="DLF">street</span> begging for food, dying and no body even paid attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">They just picked them up in groups, on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> and they you know when I look I wonder right now, always my heart goes out for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">Because what I saw over there, I saw the real stuff, I can relate that to what's happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">But the worst was the older people, the epidemic of typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">I want you to know I had typhus at certain time, we skipped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">I had typhus too, but it was <span class="NPIP">hell on earth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">The worst was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , was <span class="NPIP">hell on earth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">To give you an example, I want to say something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">After the war I always looked in the eyes of German women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">Why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">You'll ask me because I saw one girl, one woman, I'm going to relate it to an incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I know already hungry kids, we knew which are good Germans, w which are bad Germans, who's going photograph us and they used to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , like tourist, show how Jewish people are dirty, how they live in poverty, how they just are a heap of people who wouldn't be so bad to kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">That was their real idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">One day like a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> opened in small little like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pickup</span> and I looked at it from far. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">Everytime a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German pickup</span> like this came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , everybody ran because you never know when they're going to catch up, but I was a little from far I could recognize these were airmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">They were airmen so I figured I'll wait and I'll beg for bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">I wait up there and they stopped and they want to make pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I thought very good come a little close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">So, I said they can't photograph me unless they throw me a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">So one girl came a little close and she grabbed me and hit me right between the eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">A girl, must have been a husband or boyfriend, a German soldier, says "Now tell me why did you do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">He's just a little boy," to that woman, and I'll never forget her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">After the war I was looking in the eyes of every German girl and I couldn't understand why a German woman, maybe she was 18, 19 you know something like this, why she would do it to me and I didn't get any bread and I wouldn't take any bread because to me shame was worse than hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">Then they went on, but she really gave it tome. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">What got into those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">What kind of people were they? </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">Either they were barbarians or they were just got out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">caves</span> and to go ahead and hate, make us miserable, and on the contrary they tried to I would say prosper on our misery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">They brought in people to show our people are dirty people, loused, not really prepared I would say prepare the stage where they could kill us because we are not worthy living and they are the ones who really brought this up because slowly they weakened everybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">No food, dirty water, no hygienic anything which we could be clean nothing but sickness, people dying on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , they weakened us and they made us like no humans and it's very hard for the majority of people to even resist however a lot of older people remember the Germans where they were good people from the first World War or they lived with them in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they couldn't understand, they would not believe that they could do it to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">They didn't believe that the German would eventually kill all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">They couldn't imagine, however, by slowly depriving the people of everything taking away all their privileges, taking away their education, making them look like raggedy people they prepared, they were preparing they figured that these people are unworthy to life, and it was their fault, because scientifically I'm sure they did it all scientifically to get rid of the Jewish people.</span></p>
