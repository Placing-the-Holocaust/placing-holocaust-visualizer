<p><span class="sentence" id="1371">ANSWER:  {Nickname, Tadek! </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">Tadek was his nickname. {</span><span class="sentence" id="1373">T-a-d-e-k} I got acquainted with Tadek working outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in remodeling a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for a Gestapo man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">So I was working over there with five other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">I went out to work as a carpenter and being over there, who took me in? </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">a good friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">He was working there so he said Aron you could be a carpenter, why don’t you come out to work in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">He worked -- I worked with him and over there we got acquainted with the name of this fellow Tadek. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">Tadek {bartered with him}. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">Tadek bartered with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">We brought in some different kind of watches from the <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="1383">He give us food and we took it back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">One time he came in and he told us, he told to my friends, two of my other friends, he says, he don’t look Jewish, I can get you, I can take you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> . {</span><span class="sentence" id="1385">And give you Aryan papers so you can live on and try to survive as Christians } Try to survive as Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">My two friends accepted it and after a few days, they went to him, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tadek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">Tadek supposed to send a note back. {</span><span class="sentence" id="1388">No, Hershel, one of the people was supposed to send a note with Tadek that they arrived safely}. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">So one of my friends was supposed to send it, they give us a note that they send with Tadek that they arrived safely and they are safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">Because at that time, you couldn’t trust anybody, you could tell the same Polish fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">Any Pole could come and take away the money from you and give it to the Germans and get paid for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">The Germans would pay him for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">We didn’t know, we weren’t sure what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">But he came a couple of days later to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was working and he says that Hershel and Ludnik (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">that was their names, they’re safe, they’re in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">But he does not have a note. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">The reason why he doesn’t have a note -- he says it start raining and he had to walk away, go away because the Germans are there and he didn’t bring a note. {</span><span class="sentence" id="1398">When the police was around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he was worried, frightened}. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">Worried, frightened and he didn’t bring us a note. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">This way, he used to come every other day back to our work and we did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">Bothering with him and one morning I didn’t know if I can believe him or not but one morning he came to us on the job where we were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">He said I’m going to take you, I mean the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is surrounded, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> 1s being liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">I’m going to take you, if you want it, don’t go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , Pll take you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">By that time I had to make the decision, should I take the chance and go with him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> or I mean, I wasn’t sure anyway but it still probably safer than to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is being liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">Anyway I had to make the decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">I made the decision, I’m going back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">I did some thinking after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">I went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and Tadek gave me his address. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">He marked down on my body, spread out in different <span class="NPIP">place</span> on my body. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">I gave him my -- he gave me his address and any time I have a chance, if I survive or come back to him, he’Il take 36 me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">That’s the way we parted and I went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , coming back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">I was immediately arrested. </span><span
