<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">And I -- We’re going to start with the post-war, or really, I know the story, a very touching story about the Red Cross taking you <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I wanted to ask -- my first question is, when do you identify the end of the war, or liberation period, as some call it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  Well, when the Americans occupied the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> --
QUESTION:  I should ask, where were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> -- the Americans were across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> , not only was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> bombarded by the <span class="DLF">air</span> , but also by artillery, so we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> in which we lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  When you say we?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  That is my parents and I, plus the other tenants.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Your mother had gotten tenants for -- in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , or --
ANSWER:  Well, it was an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> of six <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And going back just a little bit, when the Red Cross took you to your mother -- to your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , is that right? </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Do you remember any particular impact that the Red Cross had on your rescue? </span><span class="sentence" id="10">A lot of people have memories about the Red Cross and their work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Well, it was not actually the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">The Red Cross wanted to take me to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I insisted, I said, “No, I am dying, I want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So I -- An old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi cab</span> , converted into somewhat of an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> took me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I told the driver, ““Go and ask for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Don’t shock my mother, because I haven’t seen her for some time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And -- So, later on, I heard he went up, asked for my father, wasn’t there, then he told my mother that he had something for her, and my mother thought that it was a suitcase that my father had sent from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And he had finally said, “Look, why don’t you go with me?” </span><span class="sentence" id="17">So I -- my mother walked down. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">It was snowing, and she looked into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and she was a little confused because she didn’t recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And so then I told her, “Mother,” and finally, after she looked three times, says, “Walter?” </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And that is when she called a neighbor to have to carry me in, and I remember the neighbor touched my legs and they were inflamed and extremely painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So, eventually, they got me in and someone in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had given me an apple, that caused me to have a little diarrhea, so I asked them to take me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And shortly thereafter, the bell rang, 1t was my father and my mother yelled, “Paul, Walter is here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So he came and he saw me and then he just couldn’t control himself and cried for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Then they sh --
QUESTION:  Why do you think he was crying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  Because of my condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  He also did not expect to see you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Maybe three days later, two policemen came looking for me, and my father said, “Yes, he is here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And he brought them in and he uncovered me, said, “Do you want to take him like that?” </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And I think I weighed about 78 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And one of them knew me because I was a star swimmer, and they told my father, “Nevermind, we’re going to say that -- that he was not here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So they left and then we accommodate -- accommodate ourself in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Maybe a day, maybe two, maybe three days later, my father, upon my mother’s suggestion, tried to find a doctor who assured my parents that there was no hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So a priest was called, who gave me the last sacraments, and -- but obviously I didn’t die. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And then when the Americans marched in, I think it was April the 12", my father went to see the commanding officer, told him about me and they came with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military ambulance</span> , and took me to a <span class="BUILDING">German hospital</span> which was occupied by an American medica -- medical company, and I was with them, ooh, for quite some time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  How far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , from your parents, were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Oh, three blocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Oh, that’s wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Yeah, the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was kind of --
QUESTION:  So the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was taken over then, by Americans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  And did you say that there was a Jewish man in charge, a doctor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Yes, Major Hermann.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  And one of the questions that I wanted to ask you 1s -- is a long time sort of prospective from the post-war to the present time is, from here, from this doctor, have you experienced prejudice because you are a German in certain circumstances, and if so, where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Oh well, once with Major Hermann. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We didn’t -- It didn’t mean enough to him that I had suffered and that I was not, in quote, a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I was a German and that was enough for him, he being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">After that -- No, I think -- Well, of course, when I traveled in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , at that time it was near impossible to tell somebody, I am German, they would have liquidated you. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So I traveled through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> as a Frenchman. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I have participated in conversations like, these Goddamn Germans, these horrible, these this and this and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So, except -- until when I came to <span class="REGION">South America</span> , which is about as pro- German as you can get, in any part of <span class="REGION">South America</span> , and quite anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So as a German, no, except for the -- the -- the time immediately after the war in other <span class="REGION">European countries</span> , where I didn’t dare say that I was German, other than that no, I had -- there were no repercussions because of my heritage, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  I want to go back to your being in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and three blocks away and how long you were in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and did you see your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Yeah, my parents came from time to time and I remember that I gained, oh sometimes as much as a pound and a half a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And one day the American doctor told me that my heart would not support so much gain of weight and that I had to get up and I thought that was a bad joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But I remember h-he telling me that I had to jump on one leg 13 times and then on the other one, where little by little, I went -- some GIs drove me around in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchair</span> and I would do sketches of the GIs. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And then, maybe it was two or three months later, I walked with this cane and I was released and I was then with my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And Americans, shortly thereafter, were replaced by the British.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  In the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  No, not in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , as occupation troop. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The -- The -- si -- The <span class="REGION">American military zone</span> -- part of the <span class="REGION">American military zone</span> became British. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They -- They re-divided <span class="REGION">geographic areas</span> , where the Americans stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> and so on and the British used another part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and of course the Russians took all of <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  You had quite a -- a rich life since, which is why I wanted to start here, and I also had a question, although I understand that you were a person who loved adventure, I wondered how long you stayed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and why did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was rather unbearable, <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> , one German would denounce another German for being a member of the Nazi party, for having done this or that. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The entire <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was destroyed, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> 75 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">There didn’t seem to be a future. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Money did not exist, it was bartering. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Coffee, cigarettes, butter were the main items for bartering. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">My parents had lost my brother, who had fallen to his death in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">My mother continuously cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So it was a period of depression and even though at that time it was an impossibility to leave, you couldn’t leave -- you couldn’t go in the <span class="DLF">street</span> after 10 o’clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But somehow I flirted with the idea of going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And anybody with whom I would have shared the idea would have declared me insane. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I went to see a teacher of mine, an old teacher who -- I understand that he had an estate, or his family had an estate in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And I didn’t know that much about the difference of <span class="REGION">South America</span> and <span class="REGION">North America</span> , to me <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I went to see him, and I remember he asked me, “Where do you want to go, eventually?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="76">Well,” I said, “<span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .” “</span><span class="sentence" id="77">What part of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And I said <span class="REGION">North America</span> just to give him an answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">He said, “Well, I’m very sorry, but my family has an estate 1n -- close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buenos Aires</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Then I went to see my father, and I told him that -- that I was going to try to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Said, “You know that’s impossible.” </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Well, I said, “I’m going to try.” </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And he said that, “If I didn’t know you, I would say you are crazy, but -- but there’s no need for me to say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">All I say that whatever person you meet, just expect them to be no good and if they are good, you’re going to have a very pleasant surprise.” </span><span class="sentence" id="85">That was his advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I had previously tried -- well, let me explain that many Germans in large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , knowing that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> were to be or were being bombed, took certain items of value and shipped them to relatives in <span class="REGION">rural areas</span> , which happened to be the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">My parents had shipped a suitcase to some friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And going to the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> was quite an adventure and I went to the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And that itself is quite a story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Was this the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER: <span class="REGION"> Russian zone</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  And that meant that the Russians were in charge of everything [indecipherable |
ANSWER:  They were the occupying force, and they were terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So, we’re -- going to the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> was in itself something like going to a <span class="REGION">foreign country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I had gone there twice, so I figured that somehow I sh -- I should be able to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I had an address of a relative of a friend in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  What was your motive for going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Oh, I was sick and tired of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , of the situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , thought there must be better places in the world then, than corruption, <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> , degeneration, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  So you said goodbye to your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Well, I didn’t say, excuse me, I didn’t say goodbye, I told my mother that I was going to a water polo championship, and she said, ““There’s nothing like that.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="100">Yeah,” I said, “veah, yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Ill be back next week.” </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I came to see her again seven years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So she didn’t know that I was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">She thought I was going to be away for a few days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Did you tell that to her to protect her, 1f anyone asked, or --
ANSWER:  Oh, yeah, I -- I -- no, I told that to her because she would not have allowed me to leave, and I didn’t want her to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So I stow away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Achen</span> , which 1s right on the <span class="DLF">border</span> , and there I -- I had some cigarettes with me that I gave to a railroad employee, and I asked him -- I spoke to him with a French accent and I told him that I had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as a French prisoner of war and that I’d fallen in love with a German girl and I’d come to see her and I needed to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And I wondered whether he could help me, whether there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> going across. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">He told me about a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo train</span> and well, I hid in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cargo train</span> and went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I went to see an old farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Matter of fact, I visited the farmer’s son last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And he told me, “Don’t come up, they’re looking for Germans all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so --
QUESTION:  How did he know you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  He didn’t know me. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I told him who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">He was the cousin or nephew of a lady in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">You have to underst --
QUESTION:  Oh, sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  -- You have to understand the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border towns</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , they were German during the Kaiser. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">After the Kaiser, they -- they became <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Hitler took it back, and after Hitler lost, they returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So those <span class="REGION">areas</span> , like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace-Lorraine</span> , they all speak German and they’re probably more German than Belgian, or Germ -- [indecipherable] so anyway, he gave me some sandwich, an apple, and told me that I should wait for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">milk truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">It took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liege</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Well, at -- at noon time, I was in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and I stayed a few days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , visiting with a friend of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Then I went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and eventually I became a sailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">That went on until December of ’48, when I stow awayed on a -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch freighter</span> and went to <span class="REGION">South America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Before we get to <span class="REGION">South America</span> , I -- I was interested that you learned English from American Gls. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Could you --
ANSWER:  Well, I didn’t learn from them, let’s say that I progressed, cause I had had English in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I was -- I’d always been a linguist, so languages are not of any difficulty to me, and so, with the Gls, I had a very good opportunity to practice and to learn more vocabulary and maybe become a little more Americanized in -- 1n my speech pattern.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  And this is while you were in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  True, true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  So, how did you get to <span class="REGION">South America</span> now”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Well, I stow awayed on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch freighter</span> and went first to <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  How -- Do you remember the name of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freighter</span> , or --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Par-Parkhaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Pay -- P-a-r-k-h-a-v-e-n. One of the oldest <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> at the time, was still a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal ship</span> , and then a -- there weren’t too many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal ships</span> around any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  Coal, c-o-a-l?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  And from what <span class="DLF">port</span> did you --
ANSWER:  From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  How do you stow away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  Well, at the time, in different ports of Europe, I went aboard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> , and -- well, the first time I went on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was I worked in a <span class="BUILDING">nightclub</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> drawing portraits and a captain walked in and he was -- he was quite drunk already, but I did his picture anyway and he paid me and he drank more, and eventually he was unable to -- to walk, and I felt sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">port cities</span> , there’s always danger of being attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So, I took him under my arm and took him to his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , which was the Silver Ocean, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swedish ship</span> , and oh, it must have been three in the morning, and when I woke up, we were on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">He looked at me and said, “Who are you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And I told him, he said, “Well, if you helped me to come aboard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , I ought to help you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And he gave me a seaman’s book, which is kind of an ID card for sailors, and with a seaman’s book, you can actually work on almost any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that needs help, but I lost the seaman’s book eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Anyway, with him I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casablanca</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I went back to <span class="REGION">continental Europe</span> and I was trying to stow away on an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Argentine ship</span> , but the captain kind of smelled --
QUESTION:  What part of eur -- you mean you went directly back on that same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to return to --
ANSWER:  No, I went -- went back on another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> I think he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">La Rochelle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">La Rochelle</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lavre</span> , and I went eventually -- went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and eventually I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anverb</span> and I received at the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> , letter from my father, who said that, “Dear Walter, there -- you will not be able to leave Europe for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Your mother has baked special cookies for Christmas and I ask you to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and be with us for Christmas.” </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I wrote back, “If I don’t get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> until next week, Pll be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And that’s what I would have done, but on December the 16"", I was on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Parkhaven</span> and stow awayed on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Parkhaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I had someone who helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">The way it goes when you stow away from a <span class="DLF">European port</span> , you try to stay hidden for at least two days, until you’re far away from the <span class="REGION">British Isle</span> , because if not, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">speed boats</span> will pick you up and bring you back. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Captains hate stowaways aboard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  Could I ask you, before we get too far on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , did your father know that you were leaving, whereas your mother did not? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">He knew where to write you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Oh, by that time -- by that time, of course after one week, I didn’t return and I sent letters <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , s-so oh yes, my mother knew I was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">She still hoped that I would be back soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And so, on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , I think the second day, the chief steward came and discovered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> generally have curtains so the light doesn’t bother you so much and he drew the curtains and he saw me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And they convinced him not to report me to the captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">By they, I mean the few guys who knew about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And so he said, “Well, can’t leave him here, you have to find another <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So they put me to the most horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> of all <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and that 1s where the propeller of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> is. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Well there 1s a -- there’s a small <span class="DLF">ladder</span> going down if you have to repair the propeller, and there’s some old, big ropes lying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And I was there, well, I guess a day and a night. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And boy, you could always feel the water comes almost to your feet and then goes back down and it’s solid black. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I mean, a -- a -- a <span class="INT_SPACE">dungeon</span> is nothing in comparison.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  Yeah, they -- they -- they dropped some food down, or they let it down with a rope, so I ate a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Well, anyway, after that time never passed, they finally got me out and -- and then took me to the captain and the captain, remember asked me about my nationality and I told him I was French.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  You had no passport or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  No, I have no passport and -- and he -- oh, I told him that I was -- spoke Dutch and he asked me to pronounce Slavaninga, which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and no Frenchman can pronounce Slavaninga, it’s just impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So I says Slavaninga, he says, “You’re not French.” </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And so I told him that actually I was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace-Lorraine</span> and I also spoke German, and he kind of accepted that and he told me what to do and I became a coal trimmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">A coal trimmer is one that shovels coal and shoves it to the firemen, who in turn put the coal into the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So I worked together with a -- with a black guy from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curacao</span> , his name was Lovey. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And I had a shift from four to eight in the morning and four to eight in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I began to do drawings, copies of photographs and I became rather popular on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and the captain called me one day and told me that we were going to first go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vitoria</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> and that he asked me to be quiet, that he would not turn me over to the authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I had told him that I had an uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utawai</span> who was waiting for me, and that came because I had met some guys on an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Argentine ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">One of them had told me that his family lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montevideo</span> , that I was welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Then he gave me an address in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montevideo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">The other one gave me an address in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buenos Aires</span> where I could stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So anyway, I told the captain that I had an uncle in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montevideo</span> and he said, “T’Il bri -- take you <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montevideo</span> , so just don’t move in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> and let the immigration and the police come aboard and I’ ll take care of you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And so Lovey, my companion, asked me, “What did he want?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="186">Well,” I say, “he told me that he wouldn’t turn me over to the authorities.” </span><span class="sentence" id="187">He said, “You can’t trust the captain, there’s no way he will protect you. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">He’s going to turn you over to the authorities and you’ll be shipped back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Well, I didn’t want to take a chance, so we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Victoria</span> -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vitoria</span> --

<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  What did he admire about you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  Well, that I had done the impossible, swam from his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I mean, it was an unusual thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So then I went to see -- I went with Chris and I had the other address of this Argentine officer, Asketta was his last name, that I could stay with his grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So we found the address, which wasn’t too far away from the <span class="DLF">port</span> , but I was told no way I could stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And Chris had to go back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and it was January, it was the 24" of January, 1949.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  Maybe there is something innate in me and that is seeking adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">But -- Th -- Y -- I owe you an answer to your question, and that is, traveling was extremely difficult because, well, as a German of course, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> did not exist, hence there was no passports.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  W-W-Why did it not exist?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  Well, because 1s was occupied by -- by different -- as a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> it didn’t exist, it did not have a government. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">The British were there, th-th-th -- so there was a military government, but there was no passport of any sort, so you couldn’t go anywhere, it was totally out of the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And others, of course, other -- other Europeans, well, why would they travel? </span><span class="sentence" id="281">This was not the time, like today that the Dutch go as tourists to <span class="COUNTRY">Tunisia</span> and so on.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION:  In <span class="REGION">South America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">ANSWER:  In <span class="REGION">South America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">QUESTION:  Why do you think <span class="REGION">South America</span> felt that way about Jews and why do you think that they were so friendly to Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">ANSWER:  Because the Germans, first of all, there are large <span class="REGION">German colonies</span> in <span class="REGION">South America</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Peru</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299"><span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> , mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And the Germans are very desirable immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">They’re not trashy. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">They become teachers, they become professionals. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">They integrate, marry natives, contrary to the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So they’re very much desired and in demand and some of them become outstanding citizens, some of them enter politics, some of them become statesmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So, as a whole, German immigration, even in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> here, I mean, people go out of their way to say, “Oh, my grand-grandfather was German.” </span><span class="sentence" id="306">It doesn’t make a damn bit of difference to me, but they show you that -- they will not go out of their way to say that their great-grandfather was Polish, but if he was German, they will let you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And of course, there’s many, many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German towns</span> here, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brownsville</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fredericksburg</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neiderveld</span> , all kinds of German festivities and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So, anyway, going back to <span class="REGION">South America</span> , then products made in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> meant quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  Did you meet any Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  No, the only one that I didn’t meet, but I -- that I saw once, somebody took me to have a beer at a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where Germans would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">There was General Galland, the very famous young German Air Force general who had shot down, I don’t know, 200 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British planes</span> , or something like that.</span></p>

</span><span class="sentence" id="463">Well, finally they said, “For not reporting -- When you hit a deer and you don’t report, it’s 500 fine or 50 dollar fine,” it was a big amount for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And I finally became furious and I said, “You know, I dreamed of this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> many, many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Of the liberal way, of democracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">When I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , nobody ever stopped me and told me that if you hit a deer,

hadn’t slept well, I slept in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So I asked this auto auction, that’s what it was, would they allow me to leave my suitcases in one <span class="NPIP">corner</span> there and I wanted to see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> a little bit, so I walked through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salt Lake City</span> and I saw a beautiful little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for rent. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Oh, it was so inviting and I knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So neat and clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So I -- “Can I rent your <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for

you have to make a deposit first.” </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I left a suitcase, took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and went up to the <span class="REGION">San Fernando Valley</span> and eventually, oh, the first person I met was John Derek, who died not too long ago, Bo Derek’s husband, with whom I rode horses later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And he told me how to find John Carroll, who came, and then they took me in a big, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Buick convertible</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , paid the <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="499">QUESTION:  What do you mean by that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">ANSWER:  Well, you have to spend a little time in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to understand why Americans the way they are, their way of living, their heritage, the history of the Black and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">It takes a little while to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Anyway, I left -- I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> and took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Burbank</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , spent a little time and then eventually I returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Peru</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  And had the condition of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> changed or improved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  Yeah, considerably, because <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was rebuilt maybe -- maybe throw a percentage at you, 60 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">So, it was hardly recognizable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  And by now there was a government in place?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  No, there was still -- yeah, ’54 there was -- oh, I have to do some thinking now. [</span><span class="sentence" id="511">inaudible] Yeah, there was now a German government, Attanower was chancellor and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were rolling on time and things had normalized.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  And your parents, how was that, to be reunited after seven years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  Well, it was -- My father had become my greatest fan, because to him, that a young man would be able to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and make it all the way to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , that was -- he’d formed the -- the -- the admiration club. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And he wanted me to stay and work with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">He had started a <span class="BUILDING">technical translation office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">He was doing rather well. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Semi-retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">In other words, he was his own man now, he was not an employee any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And -- But, once you have tasted any part of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , or for that matter, any part of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> or <span class="REGION">Africa</span> , then <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , or Europe is not attractive any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Their way of living, the density of population, the -- the many, little problems that don’t exist here. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">The generous way of living versus existence in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">So, I couldn’t get used to the -- to the German way of living any more, I wanted to go back into the world.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Peru</span> , which was -- which had become my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and oh, I did a number of things, but ended up breeding some horses and --
QUESTION:  By now you spoke how many languages?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">ANSWER:  Oh, wa -- five. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I had started a <span class="BUILDING">swimming school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Peru</span> and I was coach of what they call the Peruvian Olympic team. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And many people in <span class="COUNTRY">Peru</span> believed, like people all over the world, I assume, that polio was contagious. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And parents of polio affected children knew that water was very good, called hydrotherapy, or water therapy, and they wanted me to take care of their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">But the others, when they heard that I was going to deal with polio children, they kind of shied away, being afraid that 1t would be contagious. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">So, I kind of concentrated with them during lunchtime. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">From 12 to two, I had nothing but polio affected children. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I became extremely successful, economically and in every way and I then dreamed of having -- well, I have to explain, when you go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lima</span> east, for about -- less than an hour, and you come to an <span class="REGION">area</span> where the sun shines, while right in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lima</span> , a situation is a little bit like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> push the clouds back, so you have this dampness over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lima</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It never rains, but you don’t see much of a blue sky, but you go a little inwards, the <span class="DLF">sky</span> is blue, the sun shines and wealthy people begin to have beautiful <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And in that <span class="REGION">area</span> , I wanted to build the most elegant <span class="BUILDING">swimming school</span> , where people could have a cup of coffee and watch through one-sided glass, see their children and -- and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Well, I had a child in my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , that learned to take the first steps. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Her father was president and owner of one of the largest <span class="BUILDING">bank houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And he told me that any money that I needed, would be made available.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">QUESTION:  Was he grateful to you for --
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">He just couldn’t get over that I was able to make his -- his grandchild walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So I said, “Well, at least I would like to have the <span class="REGION">land</span> and maybe then you can help me to finance the rest, any time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Well, that was a project that I was very much involved with, and a friend of mine, a Swiss architect, helped me to design something which was partly underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Well, at that time, somebody had inquired about the Peruvian passel horse, which is a very special breed of horses and -- and I was involved a little, I had a few horses myself and I loved them because they’re very elegant, they have a beautiful gait. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And the horse association’s secretary called me and they didn’t quite know how to handle this request from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and so I kind of took over and eventually the idea developed to take 12 stallions to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Shortly before that time, I have to explain; Peruvian parents, parents of polio children used to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warm Springs</span> , <span class="REGION">Georgia</span> with their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">But eventually, they thought, why not bring a doctor down here? </span><span class="sentence" id="545">We give him a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and a chauffeur, it’s cheaper and we don’t lose that much time. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So, a doctor came from <span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span> and I was introduced to him and he was rather complimentary as to the fine work I had done, and I told him that everything I did was based upon common sense, but I had no schooling in water therapy, but I would like very much to pursue some kind of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And he invited me to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warm Springs</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I thought, I get a diploma that I can hang on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and -- and then I know what I’m doing, and take it from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So, I was asked to establish contact with horse loving people and I made the same mistake that everybody else makes, and that 1s everybody believes that <span class="REGION">Texas</span> is the horsey-est state in the nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">It’s not, <span class="REGION">California</span> is, by far. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">So I wrote to <span class="REGION">Texas</span> and oh, I ended up with the Good Neighbor commission, the governor and eventually, I don’t remember how, but I ended up with the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce, and I was told that we would escort the governor with our horses, during the Battle of Flowers parade, which is Texas Independence Day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  So you had two businesses going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Peru</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">One was the water therapy and swimming and the other was the Peruvian horses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">ANSWER:  Yeah, the Peruvian horses was not a business, was -- was a pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">QUESTION:  Pleasure?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">QUESTION:  But you are now preparing, I thought, to <span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">ANSWER:  Yeah, well, what I -- what I -- what I thought was, we take the horses, get a lot of money for the horses and from there, go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warm Springs</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Georgia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And then I return, and I have money to buy <span class="REGION">land</span> , to build my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Well, we had sent some photographs -- a few photographs of horses to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Antonio</span> and the lady at the San Antonio Chamber of Commerce, gave those pictures to a guy who had Palomino horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And he looked at the pictures and they saw they were white -- not all Peruvian horses are white, but those particular pictures happened to be of -- of a couple of white stallions and he put two and two together, white, Spanish, those must be Lipisotter horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">We had quoted some -- We had given them a price idea, so I thought that was rather cheap. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So I got a letter that all the horses are placed. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And so I said, “Well, they’re sold, let’s go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I had two horses of my own and others smelled the business, said, “Walter, why don’t you take mine?” </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And there was an American who had a <span class="DLF">freight line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">He had an old flying boxcar, and we put 12 stallions in there, had two helpers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">QUESTION:  On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">ANSWER:  Put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and we shot each one with tranquilizer, so they stood like the wings. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Went to <span class="COUNTRY">Panama</span> , landed in <span class="COUNTRY">Panama</span> , were a little late, we couldn’t -- we couldn’t unload the horses because of quarantine regulations, so we tried to water them, lost a lot of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Then -- In retrospect, I understand that he didn’t have a -- a landing permit for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> , but we kind of made an emergency landing. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">One of the horses had gone with the hoofs, had stood up with the hoofs, broke the <span class="DLF">window</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I mean, it was a disaster, but we -- we made it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">We were not able to unload the horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">They went from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they dusted us and the horses and the quarantine officers were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">It was the biggest mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And then -- I had been told that horses for breeding do not pay duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Well, I was told that, but in reality, it’s horses for breeding, if you’re an American citizen, you bring horses for breeding, you don’t pay duty, but as a foreigner, you bring in horses, you do pay duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">We were not prepared to pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">We -- We prepared to cash. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So, the guy with the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was told, “Don’t unload the horses until you get the money.” </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Jack Sellars was the guy with the Palomino horses in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Antonio</span> , who was called and he said, “I'll take care of it, just bring the horses over here and I give you the money to pay for customs and so on.” </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Well, th-the driver of the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , 18 wheeler, was Black and fell asleep while he was driving. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So I took over, drove to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Antonio</span> , and while he was asleep -- oh, Jack Sellars was there waiting for us and I realized he -- he realized that he had made a mistake, we didn’t have Lipisotter horses, and Jack Sellars kind of disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">We were at the <span class="BUILDING">coliseum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Antonio</span> with 12 horse, I said, “Unload the horses, before he wakes up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And I told him, “Go back and don’t worry, we’ll pay sooner or later.” </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Well, the press came and there I was with 12 stallion and two helpers, so the president of Lone Star Brewing Company, Harry Jerzek, bought three horses, for way below our costs. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">People always take advantage. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">That was enough money to send the guys <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I was alone with nine horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And horses eat more than people do. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So that’s the way it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Harry Jerzek was a very important figure and he introduced me to people here and there and he organized a race, an endurance race from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Antonio</span> [indecipherable] 34 miles on the Fourth of July, 1958. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And I had coached a cowboy to go with me, and we rode each a Peruvian horse and we won. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And we were to cash 500 dollars, but then we were told, “No, no, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">The 500 dollars would have been to anybody who would beat you. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Nobody beat you, so there’s no money.” </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I didn’t understand that too well, but anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Then, as we arrived, I tied one horse up and the little lady felt sorry for the horse, because the horse was totally exhausted and I gave him water, which was the worst thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Th-The horse died the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">So I lost one horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Well, there I was now with eight horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And well, not too long thereafter, I placed some horses, see, “Can I leave some horses on <span class="DLF">pasture</span> with you?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="603">Yeah, sure.” </span><span class="sentence" id="604">You become known, you make friends, you meet people. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And I bought an old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> converted it and made it two stalls. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I said, “I’m going to try my luck,” and took two horses to <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And so then I spend time in -- in <span class="REGION">California</span> , placed some horses and --

<p><span class="sentence" id="608">ANSWER:  Met Clark Gable -- Yeah, I met Clark Gable at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Palm Springs</span> and Frank Bogartwo was Mayor of Palm Springs, twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Told me once, “Why don’t you come along, we need -- we need an extra bowler.” </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And so I bowled with Clark Gable. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And I| think Zsa Zsa Gabor was on the other team and a bunch of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Clark Gable was an extremely nice man, as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">There, I’m with Clark Gable.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="913">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">We can always get together again. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I don’t know, you asked me the question, what would you --
QUESTION:  Id like to focus on the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and where you ended up and maybe if you could just give us a little background about when you were there the first time, just like a paragraph or something, and then about your return trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="916">ANSWER:  Well, the first time was in 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> first and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> , went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrick</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">Of course, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> was a very small camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="919"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrick</span> consisted mainly of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">satellite camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="920"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> acted as a -- as a <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And I went to one of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">satellite camps</span> , but they all were under the umbrella of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrick</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="922">QUESTION:  This is from <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , to --

<p><span class="sentence" id="925">QUESTION:  And you were considered a political prisoner?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="926">ANSWER:  I was considered a political prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">So, in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , did not mean as much as the word implies. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">To me, it was not getting worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">As a matter of fact, it was getting a little better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="930">QUESTION:  You didn’t fear for your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="931">ANSWER:  No, I feared for my life, but not -- not of being killed, rather, a-a-a-a-at the very end, I feared I was -- I was afraid I would die.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="933">ANSWER:  Because I was -- I was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">See, I had tried to escape, I had done several things. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">My conduct in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> was so that three times I was put in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , for one month each time, with 200 grams of bread and butter, I -- bread and -- and water. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">So --
QUESTION:  You were only wishing for butter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">So that puts you down pretty fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And then, where they needed soldiers, I was called and I was told that I should be ready, I would be transferred to a penal company, which meant the first <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And I refused, because I was 1n no condition to be a soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">That refusal prompted then, the transfer to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , as a matter of fact, one of the toughest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">So, the first time I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I had decided, beyond any doubt whatsover, to visit the warden of the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in which I had spent about a year, and kill him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="944">QUESTION:  Is this Spider?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And I went there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">QUESTION:  When was this that you went?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">ANSWER:  Oh, that was when I went in -- I assume that was when I went back in °54, after the -- after seven years. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And, you know, I -- I had made up my mind to say, “Do you remember me? </span><span class="sentence" id="950">May I refresh your memory?” </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And then eventually I would have killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And I knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and a lady came. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">I said, “I come to see Dr. Soikner.” </span><span class="sentence" id="954">She said, “Well, I’m very sorry, but he’s no longer here, he moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Well, that of course changed the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">I was not about now to take the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , because from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> is a long way. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">So, I kind of -- kind of forgot it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="958">QUESTION:  May I ask you here, then it had been seven years, and even more than that from the time that you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> or in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , and you carried this hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">Why - I don’t - | know that he was aw -- in -- very, very bad to you, but can you figure out any other reason why you carried this hate toward him? </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Was it more than just him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">ANSWER:  Oh, because I don’t believe that -- well, I never understand how man can be so evil to man. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">That’s -- That’s -- I have never come to understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">This particular man had no right whatsoever, to be so cruel, so sadistic, to a boy of 16 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="964">QUESTION:  He was beating you, and more?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">ANSWER:  Well, he was not beating me personally, but he ordered that I be beaten, he ordered that I be put into a little <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> with nothing but two slices of bread for -- for four weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">This was the ultimate of cruelty, but he was a sadistic man, who -- and there are millions like that in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">So, he’s just one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">But I carried his image with him and -- and I still dream of him, once in awhile.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">QUESTION:  Still?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">QUESTION:  You still dream of him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="972">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Yeah, I still dream of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Once in awhile I see myself -- I do a lot of scribbling with a pencil and I see myself doing his profile. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I say, “Dammit, why do I do this?”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="976">QUESTION:  What do you mean by doing his profile?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="977">ANSWER:  Oh, I start drawing and before I know it, I have his nose and I have his profile there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="978">QUESTION:  Maybe he represented, because I know, from your childhood on, with your father as mentor, you were anti-authoritarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">So, it’s terrible for anyone to be in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , but for someone who is as anti-authoritarian as you, perhaps could he have represented something greater than just himself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="980">ANSWER:  Yes, that is -- that is -- that is very true. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I mean, I was very much like putting an eagle in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="982">I was free. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">I was supposed to be born in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , the son of a big rancher, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="984">But it didn’t happen that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">So, yes, I hated him passionately, I mean passionately. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">I don’t know in retrospect -- these are all good questions, and nobody can answer -- what would have happened if I had killed him? </span><span class="sentence" id="987">Would I have sleepless nights over him? </span><span class="sentence" id="988">I don’t know that, it didn’t happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="989">QUESTION:  Well, this brings up a comment that you did make, that you have killed and I just wondered, although I know it may be very unpleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">Can -- Can you say what -- what circumstances you were in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="991">ANSWER:  Well, I -- When I went into the <span class="REGION">western zone</span> -- see the Russians -- Americans were very nice and they picked up scientists and brought them over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">Like Werner Ferbrown and son. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">The Russians would ship anybody to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and they would do the screening in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">If you were an engineer, fine, if not, well we can -- we can still use you. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">SO --
QUESTION:  They were not as discriminant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="996">ANSWER:  Oh no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">They could use all kinds of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">So one day we were stopped at a <span class="DLF">border crossing</span> --
QUESTION:  This was around what year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">ANSWER:  Oh, that was --
QUESTION:  After the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1000">ANSWER:  -- °47 -- °46. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">End of ’46, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And I had a young lady with me who was -- well, in my <span class="REGION">area</span> I had become somewhat o-of an expert. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">I had gone twice into the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> , “Let’s go with Walter, he knows his way.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Well, we were stopped, taken to an old forest ranger’s office, and some of the women were raped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And we were marched, and I knew, from here, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we’ll end up in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">And an elderly guard with a machine gun was behind us, and I began to have like epileptic attacks, just to see how he would react. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And finally I got hold of his gun and killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">So that was one of those situations, and we -- we ran, and nobody crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> for a long time there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1009">QUESTION:  How did you travel? </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">What <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , what --

<p><span class="sentence" id="1016">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">Well, so in other words, it was self defense, right.?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1018">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1019">QUESTION:  You were defending yourself and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1020">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1021">QUESTION:  So I think now is a great time to go back to your more recent past, and tell first, how did you get the opportunity or the inspiration to return to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1022">ANSWER:  I was invited to meet a friend of mine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">I have a friend in -- a Belgian friend who has a very large <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of making bakery equipment, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> and so on, in <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And every four years, the largest baker’s convention exhibit is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , enormous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">And -- And I promised that we would meet there and said -- you know that close -- I was always a little hesitant to go back, I didn’t want to remember and past 1s past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">But he said, “Walter, if you want to go, Pll lend you my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> .”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1027">QUESTION:  How far was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1028">ANSWER:  Oh, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , maybe 60 miles, 70 miles, 80 miles, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">So, I had drove up there, and unfortunately the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">man’s camp</span> -- well, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">woman’s camp</span> did not exist any more and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">man’s camp</span> didn’t exist any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women’s camp</span> , at least the -- the permanent <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">The -- The <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> part, where the women were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were all gone, because they had typhus, everything was burned down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">man’s camp</span> was gone, there was a -- a Russian military company was there, so I couldn’t even go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">So the only thing I did is went into the main <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , which was the <span class="BUILDING">administration building</span> of the SS, and got a couple of pamphlet or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">I remember the lady told me something, I don’t remember what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">I said, “No, you’re wrong,” and I corrected her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">And she said, “How do you know?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">I said, “Well, I was here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And she looked at me. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1040">I don’t remember [indecipherable]” But anyway, that was- that was it and I remember when I stood there and I wanted to cry and I just couldn’t, and I was like -- like a stone figure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">I was -- It was tough, and it was very difficult to -- to drive back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">But it was -- it was -- it was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">So --

QUESTION:  I wanted to ask you now that we’re on the physical, cause I know you were wa -- you had TB and you were beaten and you discuss in the ’96 interview, pain in your legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Have you had physical problems that result -- that come back, from that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1267">ANSWER:  The only thing that is evident is that as a consequence of malnutrition, nerves in my legs have suffered greatly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">And so, I cannot stand for a long time, then I begin to dance around and try to find -- especially on <span class="INT_SPACE">concrete floors</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">But, other than that, I’m -- I mean, I had back surgeries, but I cannot stand here and look you straight in the eyes and say the surgeries can be attributed to my being imprisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">So --
QUESTION:  What about your experience, not just being in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , but in watching -- in getting sort of a close up, but outsider’s view of -- of what happened in the Holocaust to Jewish people, is there anything beyond the physical that you think had informed you, that informs your decisions, as to where to go and what to do and what your interests are, from that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1271">ANSWER:  Well, my interests right now have to be, I have given the children I have -- the children I have left, about as liberal education as possible and I have never allowed any form of segregation to exist in my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">And the daughter I have now will grow up to be as liberal, as objective, as understanding as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">Of course, I have no voc -- no -- no control over whether she going to -- going to end up at the age of 25 with drugs or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">I-I hope not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">Other than that, I look left and right and unfortunately, whenever you see something like the Holocaust, you -- you -- you would think that something like that can never happen again and I wish I could believe that, but I can’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">So, atrocities in the world are not a dampener, or not a way to tell people, “Let’s go into mass education and prevent this from happening again.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">No, no, there are many, many prisoners or leaders who said, “Let’s keep people as stupid as possible, because it’s so much easier to govern them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">Let’s create some sort of sickening nationalism and let’s teach them that the Albanians, or the Jews, they are no good, they are responsible for your bleeding, they are responsible for your bad economy, they are the ones.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">I see it again and again and again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">So, humanity has not changed and will not change, unless there is some -- some kind of enlightenment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1281">QUESTION:  In considering the small daughter of yours, who I saw, and her generation, what would be your greatest hopes that she may be? </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">I mean, I know the greatest fear might be drugs, but the greatest hopes that she might take away with, say when she reads her father’s book?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1283">ANSWER:  That she will become compassionate, understanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">That she will ask a thousand questions why, why, why, instead of accepting blindly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">That she will learn about other cultures and grow up to be the kind of person that you must love.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1286">QUESTION:  But, I wanted to ask you some of the follow up questions from Arwin and one of them is your -- your birthdate, and your father’s and brother’s full names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1287">ANSWER:  My birth date is 31“ of May, 1926. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">My brother’s full name was Paul Meyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">My father’s name was Paul Meyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">My mother’s name was Henriette Meyer, and her maiden name was Sommerhauser, S-o-m-m-e-r-h-a-u-s-e-r.
QUESTION:  This is an interesting question, I think, that you mentioned that, in your ’96 interview, that during the time you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> , which I’m only pronouncing this as an American child, in the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> , there was a hierarchy of nationalities among prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1291">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1292">QUESTION:  At what rung of this hierarch-archy were you and other German pris-prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1293">ANSWER:  At the highest level.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1294">QUESTION:  The highest level?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1295">ANSWER:  Mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1296">QUESTION:  You were privileged at all, because of your nationality?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1297">ANSWER:  No, that was not privileged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">It just happened to be divided like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">It had nothing to do with -- wi-with -- with a privilege. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">I mean, we were -- we were picking rocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1301">QUESTION:  Oh, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1302">ANSWER:  So that was not -- that was not the -- the highest level was just as bad as the lowest level, so --
QUESTION:  Were there any Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1303">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1304">QUESTION:  So, was there mixing between ethnic or national groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1305">ANSWER:  There was -- There were -- There were quite a few Russians, Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">When I say there were no Jews, that I know, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">There were some, I understand, some French prisoners of war were there, and maybe a few Czechs, and so and so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1308">QUESTION:  I really like this next question, it’s, listening to you talk about your experiences during the war, Arwin is struck by what seems to her to be a very optimistic attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Is that an accurate assessment? </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">Did you feel optimistic at all at that time, or did it come back later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1311">ANSWER:  Well, Miss Donohue, I have been asked that question many times, and there seems to be evidence that I am optimistic, but I want to make a correction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">My optimism is not -- is an innate thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">In other words, I do things not because I’m optimistic, but because I do not think that the consequences may be devastating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">You understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">People prepare themselve and say, “If I do this, if I get caught, oh my God, what am I going to do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">I let things happen and then I think, “What am I going to do now?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">So, I don’t know whether optimist 1s -- 1s -- 1s an accurate word to describe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">I think I am rather -- I would rather use the word irresponsible, because in my past, I have been too -- playing with fire too much, and that is an irresponsible act. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">Oh, I’m going to get away with it, ah, nobody’s going to catch me, or nobody’s going to see me and I have no fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">But there’s a difference between having fear as a consequence of intelligent thinking, or having no fear because I just don’t give a damn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">I’m -- I’m -- I’m -- So, I’m an adventurer really, I’m a Gypsy by -- by -- by sheer and weird conglomeration of genes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1322">QUESTION:  And speaking of genes, did you say something about no Jewish blood for five generations? </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">Does that indicate --
ANSWER:  I had to prove that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1324">QUESTION:  How did you prove that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1325">ANSWER:  Well, you had to prove that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1326">QUESTION:  Oh, so you don’t know what happened before that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1327">ANSWER:  Before five gener -- <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , no, I could have a lot of Jewish blood, but no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">You had to prove that for five generations, you were Aryan.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1329">QUESTION:  Had to prove to whom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1330">ANSWER:  To the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1331">QUESTION:  When did they ask? </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">Did they ask your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1333">ANSWER:  Well, when you -- when you -- for example, were you a member of the Hitler youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you see people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> like -- like in other <span class="REGION">European countries</span> , they were born here and they died here, so it’s -- it’s -- it’s very -- it’s not like <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , say, “Where did your grandfather come from?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1335">I don’t know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you know where your grandfather, your great-grandfather, where they all came from, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">My cousin lives in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which my father was born and that existed in 1590.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1338">QUESTION:  Your cousin that’s visiting here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1339">ANSWER:  This cousin here.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1347">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, I’ve known her forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1348">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1349">ANSWER:  I knew her as a baby.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1350">QUESTION:  That must have a -- a very -- a feeling of closure, doesn’t it, to have a relative from that time, and --
ANSWER:  Yeah, she is very close to me, she is a good woman and she lost her husband with cancer and her son was involved in a head-on collision, so he was in coma for three -- three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">And she is a fine, fine, fine woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">Good woman and my parents loved her to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1353">QUESTION:  When did your parents -- I know you told me about the death of your father, but you didn’t -- When was the last time you saw your mother and father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1354">ANSWER:  I saw my -- my father maybe six months before he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> rather frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">And my mother died in 80 ti -- no, my mother died in ’79. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">And I saw her in the last weeks of her life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1358">QUESTION:  Here’s an interesting observation by Arwin, on relationships with your parents after the war, particularly your relationship with your father, whom you seem to have seen in the early days as the chief force against which you rebelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">You actually mention now that, or that in ’96 interview, that you are exactly like your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">What do you mean by this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">Is this possibly a tie-in with his feeling -- your feelings about authority in general, after the war and today”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1362">ANSWER:  W-Well, my father thought that beating me up would conform me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">If he had a been somewhat of a psychologist, he would have said, with a little sugar and a little candy, Walter is going to be a fantastic human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">But he beat me up until I was blue and red, a-and at the age of 12, if you had given me a gun, I would have shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">When he saw me after the war, from then on he tried so hard to undo and redo and he was the most unselfish man I ever met. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">And he tried to give me his right arm and his left arm, until one day I told him, “You cannot buy my love. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">Just forget all the bullshit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">I -- I -- Let me try to forget.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">And I came to love him, and I miss him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">I wish he would show up some bi -- weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">Death is a kind of miserable thing, anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">So, when I say I am very much the way he was in many ways, I’m a rather unselfish person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">I never buy things for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">It’s my wife who buys a new shirt or something, I don’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">I don’t particularly care how I look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">I don’t particularly care what I eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">I don’t need any luxury whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">I don’t need a new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , as long as the one I have runs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">So, in that respect, I’m much happier with -- with beans, than I am with -- with -- what do the Russians have, the fish eggs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1380">QUESTION:  Caviar.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1381">ANSWER:  With caviar, yeah, you know”? </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">So, my stape is -- my taste is simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">So, I am as impatient as he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">I’m a little -- I tend to be violent, as -- as he was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1385">QUESTION:  In -- In what way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1386">ANSWER:  Violent especially by, if I see a uniform, uniforms have a tremendously bad impact on me and when they -- well, you know, not too many years ago, I had a problem with a policeman and I broke his -- his -- his -- his nose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">You don’t do that, you ought to control yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">It’s difficult for me to control myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">It gets better as I get older, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">So, I have many of my father’s traits, but I’ve also let -- like my mother, I have all the artistic blood from my mother and so on, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1391">QUESTION:  You said that she was writing?</span></p>
