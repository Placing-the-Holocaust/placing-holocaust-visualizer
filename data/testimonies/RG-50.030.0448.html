<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Imemories of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hindenberg</span> are practically zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I don’t remember the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My father being a political activist was persecuted much earlier than the general Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He was constantly in hiding and at certain times they would storm the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and take him away for short periods of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So they decided to escape <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and that was <span class="REGION">Eastern Poland</span> where my mothers family lived and also my fathers family resided in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My mother’s family owned a <span class="BUILDING">textile mill</span> and they were distributors for textiles as well as had the <span class="BUILDING">retail store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My recollection of that plays a very vivid they were very happy days even for the fact we were displaced from our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">My grandparents and the siblings of my mothers and father were living in a very large <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , within that there were like <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> where my aunts and uncles were living and I had a lot of cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We used to play together. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Early restrictions were started to impose upon us as the Germans were storming <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but relatively it was a happy time for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  Let me just ask you a little bit about the happy or happier times and where exactly where you do you know where this was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was small the name was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shotcouf</span> and we were living on the out skirts of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yelganetza</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  So before there were to many restrictions were you was your family practicing religious traditions and customs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  My family was conservative, we adhered to all the holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My parents were going occasionally to the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> on Saturday and they were considered quote unquote a cultural family. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I learned Hebrew, I love the Hebrew songs and music and in general I was raised in the Jewish traditional life and I loved it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Were you mostly around other Jews at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  No not not specifically because my family was waiting with non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So I used to play a lot with all kinds of children of different faiths and when the restrictions were imposed upon us the mere fact that I couldn’t play with the non-Jewish children made a big impact upon me. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I do remember wanting to play with a certain child that I like very much and prior to the war we were very good friends and as I approached her one day the mother pulled that little girl away she said “Oh no you can’t play with her any more she is no good she is a Jew’, and the little girl said ‘What is a Jew, she is my friend’, and that thats when I really started feeling different. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">It was also the fact that I couldn’t play on the <span class="DLF">play ground</span> that mainly our activities were restricted to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , with my coursins being in the same situation it made me already feel that some thing bad is coming upon us. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We used to play down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">celler</span> in the dark <span class="NPIP">places</span> , mainly inside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Do you have an image of how old you were at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  I would, think five, five years, five, six years like at an age preschool age where you know were jump, hop scotching and playing those type of games.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  So you were able to play for a while before everything was really disrupted and even though the war had already started?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Well, I real yes, I, we were relatively off, better off than other families because of the fact of a although all the goods were confiscated and a business was removed and given away to non- Jewish citizens my grandparents and parents were able to still hide some of the goods and that way they kept up secret trades with the a farmers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and the obtain food, in order to obtain food so were were not initially totally starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I remember we used to disguise ourselves a wearing shawls and peasant cloths and at night to to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and carry these good in exchange for food and many times these farmers would take there goods and not give us the farmers food and we would come back empty handed. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">But I used to look forward to going on these excursions it was an adventure and for a child it was a mysteries way of sneaking through the dark <span class="DLF">streets</span> in the evening in a disguise away. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">This was going on for a short period of time until a they were posting all kinds of curfews and threatening with being killed if we left certain time. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">The ——_—sSI'Weearring the white bands with blue star and 1t became much more restrictive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Did all of your normal daily life activities then become disrupted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Yes, that when when gradually gradually newer restrictions were announced and I remember still the sound the drums where at a city employee would come out and run to a square city square and listen to the announcements. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">What we can do and what we can not do and all the restrictions and so on so. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">It it it became gradually more difficult to live, also big impact on us when they started bringing Jews from different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hungry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Suddenly they brought hundreds of Jews and into the <span class="BUILDING">synagog</span> where they camped out there and these people were poorly malnourished. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">They have no food they have no clothing they have to leave suddenly, and thats when we realized that a actually there is a war and that we are going to be involved, by probably being displaced also.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Where you frightened at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  I was I, can not describe the feeling of a child the because I just experienced these restrictions as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">This is what it is you can’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you can’t play, you can’t you don’t have much food, you can’t go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on certain days. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">You the <span class="DLF">windows</span> have to be shut, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> have to be shut. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We we each member of the family was assigned to sit guard behind the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Lets say 12 hours a day there was a exchange each member was taking a turn and there was fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">There was anxiety and there was an air of uncertainty. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">You didn’t know what tomorrow might bring. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">It it 1t was a kind of a day to day life, moment to moment really. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Along with restrictions I know they form a Unionrod which was a collection of elders and my my uncle was part of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Unionrod and through him we were learning some of the horrors that were going on in the larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> not to distant from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">There was our only connection to the outside world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  What did your parents tell you or what did they try to explain to you at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  They didn’t, they did not tell me much. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I used to hear, stories of the old good days when the Kaiser was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">World war one and the excitement then they the excitement adventures of wars and I kind of thought that was a really neat thing to be able to wonder from <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and a see soldiers fighting and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And so I imagined that to be the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Little did I know that this war was going to be directed against me. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">My image of a war was soldiers against soldiers not soldiers against children. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">We really were not, as children we were not prepared for anything realistic the adults probably knew and I used to hear them talk about killings and death and so on but, as children we did not know what to expect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  Did you hear anything about Hitler specifically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  Oh, yes that was mentioned a lot and I remember the adults talking why doesn’t Roosevelt do something about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And more why doesn’t the world organize against Hitler and why don’t they try to to to help us to get out of this misery here. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But thats as far as I could understand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Where you living in a getto in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chorkof</span> , or you were always outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chorkof</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  We were living outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chorkof</span> at at only for a brief period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">What happened was that soon after they formed the Unionrod we heard of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Acktunin</span> an action being a a being performed in all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Well one day my uncle came running from that Unionrod screaming at us to disberse something terrible is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He didn’t know what but nothing good and to run away, just get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I don’t want to see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">That was the beginning of the extermination of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I remember my mother grabbed me she said “Lets go lets run”, some of the other members ran down the we had a very big <span class="INT_SPACE">celler</span> and they ran down there and my mother grabbed me and said “Lets go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So we went outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> falling on our <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> until we reached some <span class="BUILDING">farm farmers houses</span> we heard shots very soon, very near by we hid in stacks of hay from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the shots were coming closer and closer , we knew we had to move fast, we could only move at night or in the dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We crawled to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> until we started hearing voices, these were Jewish members of the city carring dead bodies to a near by <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We kept on moving farther and farther away until the lamenting shots became much more distant and pretty soon quieted down. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We stayed in a hay stack at a <span class="BUILDING">farmers house</span> over night. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">The <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> was so small and so tight, that I remember laying there over night doubled over until early morning when the farmers left for the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">We crawled out of there and the bright day light really blinded us and we stretched out and was pretty quite and peaceful and then we decided to move back to watch the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We came back and a deadly silence greeted us there was blood and dead bodies in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And we came back to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was totally ransacked the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were broken, there was nobody there, we sat on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Pretty soon some members emerged from the <span class="INT_SPACE">celler</span> and they were telling us how the Germans were searching <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and killing people and lucky they didn’t discover them in the <span class="INT_SPACE">celler</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">My father who used to be in hiding all the time escaped last minute and hid in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And then when he returned, upon his return he was sure that we were all killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">My uncle who was in the Unionrod was a witness to all these killings and death. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">At that time my brother who a was not a direct member of the Unionrod, but my uncle use to keep around him there because he thought it a much safer <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Was taken from the Unionrod and he was made to gather all the dead bodies into the villages square and then he was lined up and taken away with the transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Later on some of the farmers was telling us they stood and watched and they saw the Jews marching towards the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> and they saw my brother along side my grandfather march along without a speigel to their death. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">My uncle described the scene when they lined them up he was pointing with his sad eyes towards him like making a gester rescue me, get me out of this <span class="DLF">line</span> , but he couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">One of the Jewish elders tried to pull away a little girl out of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , his own litle daughter, and he was shot on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">After that and a few other action occured, they wiped out the total <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">The few left over people and among them we were part of the left over population was transported to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lutrouch</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  I just want to ask you a little bit more about your brother, can you tell me what kind of relationship you had had with him before he was taken away”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  My brother was older than I quite a few years I don’t know totally how many for sure like five and I always looked up to him, he was like my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">For a child I used to love to brush his cloths and shine his shoes, looking for his approval and he was joining always organizations like Shamar Zier, and I always love when he took me by his hand, took me to these meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I remember Saturdays when he took me there, there was always singing going on and he was a very good student and in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and he used to tutor other children and I always go along with him and he play the violin and I always hope that some day I would, it was a very close relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  How did you react to hearing that he was taken away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  I was totally devastated, I kind of refused to believe he’s really dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I always have the image that he escaped somewhere from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I went into total isolation, I did not speak to anybody, I wore black cloths. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">As a child I associated that already with black cloths, I wouldn’t eat, I just totally went into morning more than any adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It was a devastating experience for me and I totally refused to acknowledge that he’s not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I remember even some how get a hold of a piece of chocolate, I don’t know how it ever came to my hands, I refuse to eat it I was saving it when he comes back for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Do you think that hearing about him being killed, made you more afraid at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Did that change any of your feelings about the war and the war time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  I really didn’t hear that he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I knew that “They were taken away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And the adults knew that there was no return from those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but I as a child refused to believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">My image was always that he escaped and he will come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">As far as fear I personally, I can not describe the feelings of fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">It was a life of living from moment to moment and I I I just have never had that feeling of fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I felt that I have to meet what comes and any challenge that will come I should surmount it. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It is amazing to me that as a child during those times before this action and this devastating action that took place, my main concern and regret was I couldn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I couldn’t play, I couldn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> that was my main depravation I experienced during those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Not so much food lack of food or lack of cloths 1t was more lack of freedom, lack of playing of interaction of other children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Had you gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at all by this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  [had gone to a little <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> , which I remember just a <span class="BUILDING">play school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">As far as learning to read, I was all taught by osmoses, my father used to read to me because he was in hiding I would go down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">He would read to me, he would sing songs to me, tried to teach me Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">That was my main education was underground education.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  What languages were you speaking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  I was speaking German and Polish not as fluent and then my father taught me Russian, and some Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Ya I remember he taught me also Hebrew songs, poetry and Russian poetry, he read me instead of children stories, he read me stories tell stories Thats what I grew up upon, war and crime and that kind of thing, and not Cinderella stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  When you were near this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Shortkof</span> , did you experience any contact with Germans or did you experience any anti Semitism yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes very much so, even as a child I knew I was different, even at <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">There was a time “Religion” and we as Jews would not, as Jewish children would not go, that hour we had to stay out and that by itself made us feel different and bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I personally was treated a little bit better and I don’t understand why maybe because my family was more influential. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">In the <span class="REGION">area</span> I was well known but I used to hear all the time Shid Shid, which in Polish is Jew and I felt a different treatment by the teachers, I definitely saw that I more rejoiced in fact in the Hebrew language and the Hebrew spirit and didn’t dwell much of the other side of the a being maltreated as a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Did you ever go to your parents and ask them about being called a Jew in that way, in that derogatory way?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  Did you have friends and were they always Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  No and that thats when I started feeling that there was different, I had Jewish and non-Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I had a lot of friends and I was a leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">When we were playing I was always the leader and I started feeling this difference by the non-Jewish friends turning against me, and I even remember the farmers or the villagers used to come to take some of the goods from us and some of the children would come along. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Later on those children would turn away and wouldn’t speak to me, gee why you come to take all of our goods and you still dispise us and don’t like us. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">One of these little girls said “Because your Jew and no good”, I did feel that badly but I had to make it out on my own and understand it on my own.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  We were ordered to within four hours to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , take what you can in your hands and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I think we were taken into a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and driven to we didn’t know where we were going and after some hours we arrived at this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a very depressing place. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I remember coming in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> there were cobble stone <span class="DLF">streets</span> was no lights, <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were dark the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were filthy and smelling, gray cobble stone and we were taken to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was like a two story <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , there were some inhabitants there already. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">There was a dark <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> there were a few <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> assigned to families, there were like eight to 14 people to a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and there was like a communal type of a life. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">There was a two story <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there was only one <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">lower floor</span> and I remember the <span class="DLF">lines</span> they used to be lined up for that <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I was always thought gee what if someone was constipated and got stuck there and all these people still waiting in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">In a way it wasn’t totally totally a destructive life there because we lived together because there were some children from different families that we interacted right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Except now we started to experience food shortage and much more limited freedom of movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We were not allowed to leave that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , toward evening one member of a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> snuck out and brought back some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I remember that there was like a <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and my father did not look Jewish at all and he would be the one to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and venture out, he grew a beard and mustache and looked very much Aryan. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And he would come back and bring food. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Many a time we didn’t know if he was going to come back because he could have been caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I still remember specifically in those times members were appointed to sit guard, and I was a little bit older and I was to sit with an adult, looking out through the crack in the <span class="DLF">window</span> , which was totally covered with a sheets, looking out across the <span class="DLF">street</span> was the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And I used to children walk and children play and I just couldn’t imagine through a children’s eye what it would be for me to be able to go across there and just walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Thats when I really started to experience [end of side one, tape 1]
QUESTION:  Would you continue to tell me a little bit about your experiences shortly after you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and how it felt for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  By being thrown into that open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I, and being totally limited to a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> , while looking out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and seeing the other side across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , which was the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> and seeing people walk freely and children playing and I was totally isolated and deprived of the sun and the moon. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I started to understand what it meant to be a Jew under the Nazi regime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Were you worried for your life or for your family's lives at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  At that time we, I specifically, became aware that life is very finite and we actually are in danger of losing our lives in the days or weeks to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  How old do you think you were at the time, what, what's your image of yourself at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  My, I cannot specify my age but my image of, was that of a 10 year old, going on 25, very serious about life and death. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I saw my grandmother die and she died a natural death on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and we, in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> nobody spoke about death. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I remember that night, the children were placed in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> only, I guess to protect us from the visual image of a person actually dying and taking the last breath. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And the adults and the children, the, my mother's brothers and sisters gathered that night around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and we heard the heavy breathing of my grandmother, but we didn't say anything, we just lay there motionless and I cannot speak for what the others heard, but I still remember now, it becomes so vivid in my mind, the way she was really gasping for the last breath and I remember my father, who was her son-in-law, asking for forgiveness and I remember her asking, "Why, you didn't do anything wrong, I have nothing to forgive you." </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It's the first time that I really speak of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And I remember as a child hearing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Nobody spoke anything about it and the following day, naturally it couldn't be funeral, but I remember my uncle, her son and some other men from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> were carrying her body wrapped in a white sheet. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I did not know, we were not told where they were going and what they are going to do with the body and we never knew whether they were going to come back alive because they had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">compound</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">This was the first time that I spoke about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Life went on, very restricted, if you can call it life. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">My father came to realize that it's time to do something about survival and his features were not Jewish and he grew a mustache and he looked totally Aryan, so he used to escape out of this restricted <span class="REGION">compound</span> to venture on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and as I mentioned, to bring us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">One day he took the freedom of leaving for a day and wandered into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and it was Easter day, Easter morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">While wandering through this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and trying to get some food, he started to be suspected as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">At least he was a foreigner there, nobody knew him, said, "What are you doing here, something suspicious about you." </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So he started running to different <span class="REGION">areas</span> , where he found himself on Easter morning in front of a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">The members of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> were let out after the Easter sunrise ceremony and he was so deep in pain and so much alone, that his heart started crying and he started singing Ailee, ailee(ph), the song from Yom Kippur services, with a loud, strong voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">He used to love to sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">The Christians walked out and started asking, "Who are you and why are you singing here, why didn't you go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And he started saying, "My voice sounds better on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and didn't you hear the priest sing that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And these people stood around and listening to his singing and then walking away, nodding their heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">It was ironic that he was a Jew, hiding his identity, singing a, a holy Jewish song in front of a Christian audience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  When he came back and told you about that incident, was he very worried about going out again? </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Were you very worried about him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  We were worried, but we couldn't sit and philosophically worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">By being on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , he was more in touch with reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">He picked up messages, he knew that the war is coming closer and closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And when he returned from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , he knew that something has to be done and started to organize the men in the compound to build <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> , <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So, immediate action was taken to build <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> within the big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or compound. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">They organized and searched the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and finally they found what they thought was a great <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> under the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and constructed a rock that blocked off a certain <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And that was deep <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> leading to nowhere, that's what they thought and for days they were digging and constructing that <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">At the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> they built some alternate places, <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">One day, very soon, the guard, quote unquote, the guard, was sitting in front of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> spotted some activity going on on the <span class="DLF">street</span> with German soldiers popping out on the corners. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">The signal was given for us to run to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">It was amazing that prior to that we used to practice every day, how fast we, it has to take for us to run down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and climb up those rocks and one elder was standing and timing us. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Well, time came to hide and we started hearing shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">People became panicky and one was climbing up on the other too fast, enter that <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and moved the rocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I remember there were sick people on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> and nobody could carry them down, cause everybody was running towards the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and they were left in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> was very small and the people were crowded together, there was nowhere to move, you couldn't breathe. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">But unfortunately it didn't last long, pretty soon we heard, started hearing shots and German voices shouting rousse(ph), rousse(ph), which meant get out, get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">We couldn't believe that they discovered us so soon, we were so convinced that this was such a safe <span class="BUILDING">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">What it turned out to be is that the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> was leading across the <span class="DLF">street</span> underground, below some of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> and there was the <span class="BUILDING">barber shop</span> and when we were digging that <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> , they used to hear the voices of the Jewish people building that <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and as soon as this action started, the barber right away notified the Germans and the Polish militia, that there were Jews hiding right underneath and they came straight, without having to search long. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They found the rock, they opened the rock and urged us to come out, but nobody would move, so they started shooting into the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and throwing some gas rockets, whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">People started to move back, towards the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , there was screaming of children, people bleeding from these wounds inflicted upon them by the shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">There were a few sick people laying right near the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> , they were shot on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And I remember pulling my mom and my dad and said, "Let's go." </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And even at that moment, I was thinking of my brother and I said, "Let's go, we'll join now Joshua." </span><span class="sentence" id="208">On the way out they were beating everybody with clubs. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">People became disoriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">There was blood running through their faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">They were lined, these soldiers were lined out along the <span class="DLF">corridor</span> , lining up the people and beating them at the same time, so they will be, came so helpless and disoriented and did not offer any resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Any resistance would have been met with a bullet anyhow, so there was no point. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I remember spotting my uncle, standing there and his blood was dripping from his head and we could not do anything and we were ready to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I stood with my parents and I spotted a <span class="DLF">door</span> and I tried the <span class="DLF">door</span> and it cracked opened and I pulled my mother and she says, "Why are you pulling me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I said, I pointed with my finger, with my thumb, "Go over there, go over." </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And then I pulled my father and then I, I pulled them in and we went up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , we went up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and there were bodies laying up there on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , with the blood dripping down and went into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and each of us hid under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in a puddle of blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And then we heard the lamenting voices from downstairs and pretty soon it became more quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Suddenly we heard footsteps running up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and a voice saying in Polish, "I saw you running up there, I know you are hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Stay under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> until it becomes quiet and then go down and hide again." </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And he disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">As it became quiet we emerged from under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and we went into a different hiding that my father constructed. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">It was located on top of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> which pretended to be like a <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Pretty soon the Germans and the Polish militia returned with some other citizens, to remove the dead bodies and to do a last minute search. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">They entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilet room</span> where we were hiding and instead of looking up, they looked down and there was a child that fell through the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet seat</span> , 1t was a constructed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , not like we have here and this child was deep in feces and the soldiers were standing there and laughing and one said, "Don't waste a bullet, she'll drown in the feces anyhow, " and walked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">We remained breathless up on top, until all the bodies were removed and the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Later we emerged from our hiding and there were a few other people that survived in that same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  Who had you been living with first of all, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  My parents, my mother's family and my father's brothers and there were people from other parts of different, other parts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> that were brought there, into that <span class="BUILDING">compound</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It wasn't a really compound of many <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , it was one huge <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  How many people were living in the one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  There were like, total I think there were 120 and about, I think the majority, I think 90 percent were wiped out, killed off during that one actione(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I remember as it quieted down, these people were marched out, the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , but not too far away and there was a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> being dug by some of the militia people, and all our families, there was, _, the other people from that compound and other compounds in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , were shot into that <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="233">That's where most of our family was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">There were only four members, out of about a total of 45 or 50 family members remained.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  Who were the ones surviving?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  Surviving was myself and my parents and one of my uncles.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  Had you seen dead bodies like that before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  Never, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">No, only I heard it from description. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">When they had the first actione(ph) in our little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> _, but I've never been in a trapped <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I've never seen people falling right in front of me, shot to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I've never seen people laying in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with the blood dripping down on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">This was a horrible experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But even during that experience, I did not lose my strength and will to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Because it was this little girl that really saved her parents, by being alert enough to recognize and realize that this <span class="DLF">door</span> was an opening to a life or to at least an escape for this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  What did you do immediately after this actione(ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  Well, as we were lucky enough to escape the second time in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , hiding, we stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for a day or two until everything quieted down and pretty soon [pause], we remained in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , all the four of us, wondering what's going to happen next. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">We did not remain for long alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Few days after this total destruction, new transports were coming in from nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">These were new resettlers. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was filled again with Jews from all over the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Some urban, some rural, people that had only in common by being persecuted by the Nazis because of being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">They came from all walks of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We befriended one family that was a farming, a Jew from a <span class="DLF">farm</span> that had a little girl my age and we became friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">My father, being again mobile and circling around the non-Jewish quarters, was aware that the war is coming to an end and this is a time, a final action that they final solution of the Jewish question is in sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And his only way of escape would be to do it now, otherwise we are doomed to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">We were lucky enough that we were able to save gold and silver coins that we carried in our clothing, hidden in seams. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And my father approached this, befriended a family, his name was Abraham and told them that he would offer him money in order for both of the families to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">His idea was, because Abraham knew all these farmers and had such great faith in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , that he would send Abraham to find a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">The plan was to divide our families so that in case somebody's killed, one member at least, will remain. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Abraham went back to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and was to come up with three <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">He left, but we never knew whether he would return or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">After some time he did return and announce that he found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the children would go first. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Thus it was decided that I and his little girl would follow him. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The eve of one day, we were to follow Abraham through <span class="DLF">fields</span> and <span class="DLF">paths</span> , through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> , moving forward through the night and hiding in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> during the day, in order not to be spotted by farming people in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We crawled on our four, until Abraham decided that he was going to venture out and find a <span class="BUILDING">farming house</span> and we stayed in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> until he returns. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">The two little girls remained laying there, waiting for Abraham to return. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">It took days til he returned and announced that he found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we ought to follow him and just run into a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , in towards the evening, without telling anybody or speaking to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">That night he let us into a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , we climbed up on a high stack of hay and Abraham said goodbye to us and left us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And if, if we only knew that we are in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , but we had no concept where we were, we had no image whether this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">farmer's house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We had no concept what's on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We could only tell day from night by the sound of the environment, like the crack of the dawn, the rooster, the rooster would crow, or towards the evening the farmers would return from the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">The only other being was the horse in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and we knew day from night when the horse would return from work in the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And the morning when the farmer would come and feed the horse and get him ready to go to the <span class="DLF">field</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  What did you bring with you when you left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to go into hiding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  We brought nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We could not carry anything, we had to crawl on our feet and hands and we certainly could not carry anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We remained laying on top of that high stack of hay, which was piled up, up to the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Our food consisted of a morning ration of water and a piece of dry bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">The farmer would bring the water, a bucket of water to feed the horse and out of that he poured some for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">He had a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> for the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> and he would quickly assemble the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> and with a sound, with a signal of a cough, he would approach the haystack and quickly place the, some water and a piece of bread and immediately descend. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">This repeated itself at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">The only change of meal was on a holiday or a Sunday, where instead of water, we would get some milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We could hear the children <span class="NPIP">outside</span> playing in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and we were never sure whether they were going to run into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and play, although the farmer made sure that the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> is not in sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">The only companion was the horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We laid stretched out on the, on top of that haystack, two little girls, covered under a blanket that blended in with the hay, not speaking to each other in order to conserve energy. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We could not stand up, there was <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> only to sit or lay and thus was our days going, flowing in from day to day. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We could not tell time, we could not tell season, we just existed up there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  How long do you think you were in hiding in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  I cannot tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I really can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I don't know if it was months, or more than a month, or weeks, no concept.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  Did you think about your parents a lot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  We were, but we had other things that were happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We were both alternating at night to retrieve our food, by crawling forward towards the haystack and one night I, it was my turn to do so and I reached out for the bucket and reached too far and by holding the piece of bread, tumbling over and falling off that big haystack. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">The horse, hearing that noise, got up and made a lot of commotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I laid there and cold, bleeding, the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was cement. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Lisa, my friend up there could not help me, we could not speak, not make noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">The farmer came in and saw me laying there and did not say anything, just walked out again, in order not to arouse suspicion. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">We, I wondered what is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">The following day the farmer came back and placed a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> , motioning for me to climb back up. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I was too much in pain that I couldn't move, he'd finally found some kind of harness that placed me in it and pulled my up and thus returned me to the top of the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="304">After that he let Abraham know that he wants us out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  Can I ask you a few questions about being in hiding? </span><span class="sentence" id="306">You said that you didn't want to arouse suspicion by talking, but did you ever talk with your friend who you were right next to, all that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  Not, I don't remember any talking going on between us at all, we were just laying quietly, I guess sharing each other's pain and dreams.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  What were you dreaming about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  Someday, I remember dreaming of having, imagining a bowl of soup and a matzo ball floating on it and that's justifying swallowing that dry piece of bread and water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Were you thinking a lot about food? </span><span class="sentence" id="311">What else were you thinking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  At that time, I think most of the time we were, I was just imagining a hot meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I could not think of anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  What about being around the horse, what was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  The horse became our savior and our guardian angel. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">We were always, I was always wondering whether he understood, they knew what was going on, but in certain ways he protected us from being thrown out of the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">He formed a shield that night when I fell off and I was sure that the farmer was going to throw me out that night, just throw me into the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and the horse gathered some hay around me, laid down, embraced me half-circle and I laid down on top of him, feeling the warmth of his body and, and the warm breath and the soft, friendly eyes, as if he were saying, "I'm not going to let you die." </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And he refused to eat and drink until the farmer would place me back on the haystack and leave us some food, and only then he drank his portion. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">End of tape 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Tape 2
ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  The farmer was not Jewish, is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  Correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">The farmer was not Jewish and oddly enough, in all these days when he was bringing us the food, the exchange was so swift and fast that we never saw the face of the, of, we never saw his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">We just used to see a hand stretching out, placing that food, that piece of bread and water and just retrieve right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">There was never an exchange of words between us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  Did you feel that he was nice to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">ANSWER:  It was like a mysterious kind of figure that was representing this man that never spoke to us yet must have been sympathetic and warm by doing this, endangering his own life and scheming all these activities, hiding it from his children. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">His wife was a, a, a companion and planned it along with him but every time he had to embark upon this bringing the food to us, it had to be planned out. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">The moment had to be seized just at the right time when no neighbor would spot him, when no child would, would miss him. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">It was a constant awareness of danger and way of protecting us and yet at the same time, not, also protecting his own family. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">The danger was that if he, if we would be discovered there, his own well-being would be in danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  Were you scared a lot of the time being there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  I, I cannot describe it as being scared but it was, we were always on guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">We knew that it’s only, it would take only one moment to be discovered either by a child or by a neighbor, by somebody walking into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and suspecting something. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And as a matter of fact, that’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Through some mysterious way, the farmer, not beknown to us or to himself became a suspect of hiding, quote unquote, hiding Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">One day when he was out in the <span class="DLF">field</span> working, we suddenly heard some suspicious sounds, loud sounds of militia approaching the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Within a moment or two, we realized that this 1s danger lurking right behind the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and what do we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="338">With a glance at each other we knew that we have to escape and how do you escape? </span><span class="sentence" id="339">There’s no <span class="DLF">ladder</span> and we are way up high there and those voices are coming closer and closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We jumped off that big high haystack and by some miracle we got up from that cold stone floor and ran through half-open <span class="DLF">door</span> and behind another haystack and the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and then into the wide <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Just in that moment as we went through that <span class="DLF">yard</span> , the militia was approaching the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and entered the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">There was loud noises and singing and voices of joy assuming that they are gonna catch us. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Well we were right behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">They ran into the <span class="BUILDING">farmer’s house</span> , ransacked his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and did not find us. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">We in turn laid in the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">It was broad daylight and the sun was piercing through the high <span class="DLF">cornfields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">We laid there until the evening approach, approached. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">We’re afraid to go too far away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , yet by staying too close, we were in danger of being discovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Now, and by going too far we’d have, we would have lost our way back to the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">That night we moved back and ran back into that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">There was no <span class="DLF">ladder</span> so we couldn’t climb up so we just laid there on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">The farmer suspected that we would return and came in at night into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and found us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">He mumbled something and then place the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> and we climbed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">However, he was not too happy because next morning no food was delivered to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">That following night, Abram heard in his <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> that, that farmer’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was ransacked and he was sure that we got caught and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And he came to find bodies in that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">He came and sat there at night and didn’t see any blood on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> so he thought maybe they took us away and killed us in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">He sat in that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> quiet, assuming that the farmer will come in and he did but his only greeting was that to take us away, right away he will not subject his family to danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And he wanted us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Despite all the pleading, Abram had won his confidence by giving him a day or two to go out and find another <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">He agreed to wait ‘til Abram returns next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Next day Abram never did come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">We did not know what to expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We thought maybe he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">However, after a few days, Abram came back and took us. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">He took us to, not find, not being to able to find a new <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , he divided us up and took us to where my parents were and took his little girl to where he was hiding at. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I was very weak and quite ill and it did me well be staying with my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="368">QUESTION:  What was it like to see them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  It was a shock because I myself did not see myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">There were no mirror, you couldn’t tell how I looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I was shocked by their appearance in rags, unwashed, not well nourished as you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And they were shocked by my appearance. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I was totally emaciated, unkept, in rags and I could tell from the expression on their face that I was not a very well sight to look at.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">QUESTION:  Had you known that they were also in hiding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">It was a planned situation that we knew that they were in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">We did not know where and we had no concept of the geographic location of the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">But we did know that they were alive and as the plan was, to divide us up, it was not a surprise that they were close by. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">The <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> they were at was designated by their farmer as only for two people and when the farmer walked in and saw an additional person he said, “No way. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I did not agree to three.” </span><span class="sentence" id="381">We tried to bribe him and give him some more gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">He took it and then next day changed his mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">He said, “You gotta go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And so again, Abram was caught between having to take us out of this <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> and not finding another. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">We were chased out, by now it was turning cold and winter snow was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I was very weak, practically unable to walk and Abram was just trying to help by finding another <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was no avail. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I was begging him to leave me there on the cold white snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I could not walk anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">The wind was fierce in an open <span class="DLF">field</span> , the snow was blowing, and I, all I wanted is to be left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">But Abram said, “As God is my witness, I’m not gonna let you die.” </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And he carried me on his shoulders and he was alternating. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">My father did a little bit carrying and we wandered days in that bitter cold in the white snow until we spotted a dark object far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Abram ventured out by leaving us on the snow and moving forward to examine what it was, came back few feet, telling us that it looked like it’s a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and that we have no choice but try to go towards it. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We chose to wait there in the snow while he himself ventured out. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">He dared to walk into that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and came out alive, coming back to us and carrying us, carrying me back into that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">It turned out to be an isolated little <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> in the <span class="REGION">prairie</span> and the cold snow, a very very poor farmer allowing us, agreeing to take us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We entered the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> which was totally empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">This time there was neither a horse nor a cow nor hay. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">We lay down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">cold floor</span> just waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">The farmer was very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">It was one of these, God’s people really, that had nothing worldly around him. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">He had children, they had no shoes, therefore stayed inside the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Therefore the danger of them running into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> was diminished. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">He explained to us that he had a cow that died because he could not feed her so he had no milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">His crop died in that cold weather and he had no bread and the gold that we gave him was no avail to him because he could not go into the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> to buy anything because he was known to be the poorest soul in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So on a Sunday we would have some potatoes but he was so poor that he couldn’t afford any salt. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">But he was good-hearted and really sympathized with our fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">For some time we stayed there until one day we heard shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">These were very distant and we did not pay much attention until the farmer came and said, “Do you know the war’s approaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">The Russians are coming nearer and nearer and they are beating the Germans and you’re going to be free soon.” </span><span class="sentence" id="411">We did not believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">We continued to remain in the same position, very pessimistic and doubting whether we would ever get out alive from these <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">One night, we heard very close shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Prior to those shots, we heard this lamenting of human beings was was, which was so painful, was like these lamenting cats that sometime cry at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">It was so close that we thought that it’s approaching us and soon engulf us in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I remember thinking is this how you die, by hearing these voices coming out of nowhere? </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Pretty soon, we heard some voices knocking, some sound knocking at the <span class="DLF">door</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">farmer’s house</span> and later we learned that Abraham, his little girl and his wife, at the last minute prior to the Russian Army approaching the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , were taken out by one of the farmers that they were hiding at. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Abram and his wife and daughter were dragged out into the open <span class="DLF">field</span> , close to this <span class="BUILDING">farmer’s house</span> and shot to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Thus was the end of Abraham after all these wanderings. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">After all these narrow escapes, the friendly farmer, the farmer that Abraham fed and provided clothing and provided food for his family and his animals, thus was the end of Abraham, shot by his own quote unquote friendly farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">The man that was totally a stranger to us, our farmer, explained to us that the knocking at the <span class="DLF">door</span> was one of the militia men that asked him to go out and bury those bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">The farmer described these three bodies laying in blood and the blood was still warm, melting the white snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> was so frozen that he couldn’t dig any <span class="DLF">holes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">After while, he just had to leave them there and cover them up with the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Days after, the farmer came back to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> saying, “You know, the end 1s here. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">The Russians are coming.” </span><span class="sentence" id="427">We did not believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">He said, “Look, you can come into my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="429">His <span class="BUILDING">house</span> really consisted of one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where five people were living, three children and his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">His wife was ill and was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">But we did not dare leave that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> until one knock at the <span class="DLF">door</span> convinced us that freedom is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">He came in, the farmer came in, just refused to close that <span class="DLF">door</span> and dragged that, dragged us into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">By then, soldiers came in and he explained us that the Russians are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">The Russians indeed were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They were friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">My father, teaching himself the Russian language, started talking to them with tears in his eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">My mother, I remember, was kissing their hands and the Russian soldiers were patting her saying, “Devie (ph), devie (ph),” which means no, no, don’t have to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">We are here to liberate you. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And then they saw me and they lifted me up and said indeed, that’s a yehvooshkod (ph), that’s a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">They saw that we barely were breathing and embraced us and brought in cases of food and prepared us for departure. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">We knew that we couldn’t stay in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> any longer, that we had to move forward because the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> was right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">There were bombs exploding all around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">The Russians dropped us off at the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and despite the fact that quote unquote we were liberated, the danger was lurking behind each and every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">The Ukrainian population was not very friendly to survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">They were trying to kill us at every moment that we took a step in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">At one moment, a, one of the villagers lifted his, an ax, trying to chop off our heads, when a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tank</span> rolled by and noticed that and shot the man on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I remember the villagers standing on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and pointing at us and we had to protect ourselves by hiding behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> that were rolling by. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I remember my father going over to one of the villagers saying, pointing to me saying, “You see, she doesn’t have any horns on her head. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">She’s just a little girl like yours.” </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And then the farmer spit in his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">The Russian Army was really the key to our survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">They took us in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> despite the limitations and regulations not to pick up civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">They brought us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and until the, a certain <span class="NPIP">destination</span> where they could not move on any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">They placed me in a <span class="BUILDING">farmer’s home</span> and instructed the farmer to light the fire in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> , made room for me to stay in a warm <span class="NPIP">place</span> , brought in cases of Spam and ordered the farmer to feed us, warning them that they’ll come back in a few days and they wanted to find us alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Meanwhile, the battle was going on and we had to move on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">QUESTION:  This farmer that you were with, what nationality was he?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="457">ANSWER:  The general population there was Ukrainian but he was such a simple man, a man with a pure soul. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">He did not know of any nationalities, he did not know of any differences between human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">He was just a poor soul, alive and trying to live as pure as he could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  Were you with your parents with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">That’s how we survived, the three of us, in that one <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="463">That isolated, totally God- forsaken <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , really. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">The objective was to move on and try to return to our place of origin which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shortkoff</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="465">It was not easy to move on. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Everywhere we went there was cartouches (ph) and bombs and artillery. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We also found ourselves in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> with soldiers around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">What was forbidden for us to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I remember in trying to obtain some food and going and finding a <span class="INT_SPACE">army kitchen</span> in offering my services. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I went to the cook telling him I’m gonna peel potatoes 1n order for him to give me some food for my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And he pointed a big knife towards me said, “This is not a toy for a little girl like you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And then he gave me a whole bucket of hot potatoes and I was proudly carrying it towards my parents, feeling so big and important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  How old do you think you were now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  Gosh, you’ve got me. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I really am totally at a loss. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I lost track of time and age and I have, I totally cannot recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I could see myself as a twelve-year-old maybe, doing all that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  I’m imagining that it’s probably around 1944...
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">QUESTION:  And the only record that shows your birth, you mentioned earlier as 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Have you reconsidered or thought that maybe that birthdate is incorrect?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="628">QUESTION:  Did you find it very troubling to be around such students and even the other teachers?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  Yes I did and as a matter of fact I was introduced to the English language through newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And this had started these, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vrotsluv</span> (ph) before we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">My father was a Self-taught man and he believed very much in starting early so he used to read to me, he taught himself English through certain, certain self, self, like tapes and books and they were called Longonshide (ph) letters and through those books he taught himself to pronounce the English vocabulary and learn the, the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">So he introduced me to those books and to newspapers and that’s became my, thus I learned the language of English.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">QUESTION:  Do you remember some of the first things that you learned in English?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">ANSWER:  Yeah, I remember some article, some article in the newspaper and it said, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> won a new lease of life and I couldn’t kind of translate it into German ‘cause there’s no equivalent kind of expression, a new lease of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And I remember saying to my father, I said, “Just like we won a new lease of life now.” </span><span class="sentence" id="660">That was a lot of fun to learn all that and explore and.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">QUESTION:  What language was your father using to explain English to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">ANSWER:  Some, mostly German. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">But he was, my father was also a Yiddishcist (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="664">He believed in the Yiddish language and the Yiddish culture and he used to speak to me in Yiddish too which sounds like German and so it was easy for me to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">He encouraged me so much to use the Yiddish source of literature which was very rich and to read like and Sholomosh (ph) and Byalake (ph), Nokman Byalake (ph) in Hebrew and Yiddish translations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">QUESTION:  How long did you stay or about how long in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Awnsboh</span> (ph) and then where did you go after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">ANSWER:  I think we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Awnsboh</span> (ph) approximately seven or eight months. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">From there I think I went to a very brief stay at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> because I qualified for entrance to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Munich</span> by completing that special course which was a very advanced course. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I did go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> for a brief period of time and from there we qualified to emigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">We did leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bramerhoffen</span> (ph) which is the <span class="DLF">port</span> from where the Jews embarked towards the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">QUESTION:  When you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , did you stay on your own there? </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Were your parents with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">ANSWER:  No, my parents remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Awnsboh</span> (ph) and I stayed again, I was assigned a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> 1n a large <span class="BUILDING">Nazi home</span> and again, they had a large Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and there was a self-governing body again, a Jewish self-governing body with, they’ve former, a very famous former prominent Jews being at the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And they made sure that the Jewish, remaining Jewish population had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live by, by placing them in <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where former Nazis lived and restricted der Libenstraum (ph) just like they restricted ours for a long period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">It was not very pleasant to live with these people because you were reminded every day that what, that they were sorry that they did not complete the job of total liquidating the Jewish race and that they’d have to do it over again, they would. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">So they never left that doubting that they are sorry that it did not come to be, what they planned to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Otherwise, life was very beautiful in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Again, I enjoyed my student years. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I loved the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and the environment there. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I loved the cultural life there, the <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> were fabulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">The musical life, I remember, for the first time when Leonard Bernstein came to conduct a <span class="BUILDING">symphony</span> and I went there and he personally, I got to shake hands with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">it was such a thrill for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And again, attending all these <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> and <span class="BUILDING">art museums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="684">The student population at <span class="BUILDING">Munich University</span> had a fairly, few Jewish students and we remained very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Unfortunately, the, the, the student body at <span class="BUILDING">European universities</span> is not a very close-knit, it’s not that you attend a class and you're part of that class. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">You attend certain courses on different levels. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">So we did not have one unit, there was one friend at this level, another friend on the other <span class="NPIP">level</span> but we kept very friendly and we had a Jewish student organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">It was nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="689">QUESTION:  What was the trip like to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">ANSWER:  I remember it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Everybody was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">It was quite packed. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">The journey was not very easy, the voyage through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> was quite stormy but I shall never forget, I don’t remember the year but I know the day when we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">We couldn’t eat much except the day when we arrived, we docked at a <span class="DLF">port</span> and we stood there for a whole day and suddenly we were served big portions of turkey. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I knew what it was but a lot of people didn’t know and said what’s happening, suddenly, all that big food and turned out to be Thanksgivings Day and that’s why we stayed a whole day docked at the <span class="DLF">New York Harbor</span> looking at these skyrises and the Statue of Liberty and really giving thanks for arriving at the land of freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">QUESTION:  What were your first impressions when you finally got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">ANSWER:  We had no concept what it would be like to, to arrive in a, in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that we didn’t know anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Where will, we had no plan, we were just going there without any plans what would be or how it would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">We arrived, we docked for a whole day, we were taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">They were calling out names and I remember hearing our name, Hertzog (ph), and I couldn’t imagine, say who knows us here, I mean who would be calling our name? </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And these were people from an organization, I think 1t was Hebrew Aid Society, Hiyoss (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And we were taken to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where registrations and all kinds of paperwork had to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Then we were assigned to stay 1n a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> and we were to come to that <span class="BUILDING">administrative building</span> which was somewhere around east, on the <span class="REGION">east side</span> and we were had to walk from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> to come for lunch and dinner to that administrative building. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">This was at the transitional period. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">From there we had to decide, people had to decide what to do and how to construct their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">For lots of people, this was just a waiting period to move on to different states, midwest and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Being that people had relatives in those parts of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">We were destined to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> since my father had a cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">It was a time of search, a time of instability, a time of insecurity, a time of losing self- respect for oneself, being that we were dependent on this Hebrew Aid Society to provide us with <span class="BUILDING">lodging</span> and food. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">We had only a limited amount of resources to establish our own identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">The sponsor that signed for us was a cousin of my father’s who was a millionaire in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , being the proprietor of a multi-million dollar business consisting of all, of all the things, there was hairnets that he imported from <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> that were folded and bagged in his plant in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We naturally visited him and other members of his family and the first thing to do was to invite us for dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Well after the dinner, the first question said, so, what are you gonna do here? </span><span class="sentence" id="714">End of tape 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Tape 3
QUESTION:  This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Dr. Anne Resnick conducted by Amy Rubin on November 25", 1996 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> This is tape three, side A. You were telling me about meeting with your cousin and what he was starting to ask you about what you were going to be doing in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> 
ANSWER:  Ah, my father replied, “Pll do what I always do. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I'll find a way to start a business.” </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Said, “Well how are you gonna start? </span><span class="sentence" id="718">You don’t have any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I’m gonna give you a job because I signed for that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="720">So he offered a job for my mother and for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Now legally I was not supposed to be working yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">He placed us in a <span class="BUILDING">sweatshop</span> where it was packed with women sitting alongside a large long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> folding those nets, hairnets and placing them in envelopes. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">The work was so fast and depended on the success of the speed. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">There was a foreman there, supervising the working women which have been working there for years and were very well suited for that job. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Except the two of us, strangers and never having be subjected to that kind of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And he used to stand there with a real whip and hit the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and we used to withdraw our hands because we were not fast enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">After few days of that kind of environment, we walked out and feeling very disappointed, I kept on walking the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="DLF">5" Avenue</span> , seeing a different world for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I, at the same time, I had the great sense of art and I loved to sew and prepare clothes and I started to design children’s clothing and until one person noticed that and gave me a lead where I presented it to a manufacturer. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And after a while, I was designing children’s wear at one of the biggest <span class="BUILDING">companies</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I was not happy with my life though. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I used to finish a job and say well, so what else did I do today? </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Another piece of cloth. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I, my, I, but I was determined to help my parents get established. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I also won scholarship but that was a chance that I took and, subjecting myself to a certain test that I saw at an international student organization offering a scholarship in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Southwestern University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">So I was awarded their, their, I was awarded that scholarship, went down to <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , stayed there for a short while at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> but I guess I had a guilt feeling leaving my parents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and, not really knowing what, how they gonna survive and what they were gonna do. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">So I dropped everything and came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">But then my father had, still had some resources, financial ones and had bought a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> and we all helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">My mother became the major storekeeper as my father was mainly ordering milk and supplies and that’s how we got our feet back and got back into business. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I then, it was time that I get out of this family business and my parents having lost all their property and <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and <span class="BUILDING">textile plant</span> in Europe thought that maybe they could get it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">A movement was on for , meant that the German government should restore some of the property to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I, there not being very happy in that environment of <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and just doing designing, I decided to go back to Europe and to enroll in the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> there and at the same time try to see if I could regain some of our, our property. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">It was difficult for me to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and continue my education there although I could have stayed in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> but I, again, did not feel very suited in that, for that <span class="REGION">area</span> , being that was a total different culture between, in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and enrolled at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and was determined to pursue medical degree and become a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I did make some contacts with that <span class="BUILDING">office</span> but they discouraged me saying that there properties will never be recovered. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">By then my father had had some account in a <span class="BUILDING">Swiss bank</span> and he suggested that I transfer myself to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bairn</span> (ph), <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and enroll at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , continue my medical studies there and while trying to recover the monies from the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">But that again, was to no avail. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and they said there’s no such account. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">But I stayed on at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Bairn</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I enjoyed the studies there and I graduated with honors. </span><span class="sentence" id="750"><span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> was nice in the effect that I had all the freedom to study and there was a small Jewish student population there where you could interact and pursue your studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">That was my aim and that’s was my goal and that’s why I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I used to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in the summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I used to take fellowships at various <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and join various international medical students’ groups and learned a lot and there was my life: to learn and to be able to do medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">I graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">University of Bairn</span> (ph) and then I met my father in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> after graduation. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And the meantime, a very sad thing happened, while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bairn</span> (ph), my mother was ill, became ill and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and faced that reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">It was very difficult since being in medicine, I knew what the outcome would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">However, I had to go back and continue my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">During my last year of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I was not aware of this grave situation and my mother passed away without me being at her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bedside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">My father upon consultation with a rabbi decided not to let me know until it was too late for me to come ‘cause they were afraid that I would stop <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and never return to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And being in the last year they thought it would be wise for me to finish and that I definitely could not change the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">This is still a very heavy guilt that 1s weighing upon my shoulders, not being able to hold the hand at the end of her life and I'll just have to live with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">QUESTION:  Did you talk with your parents once you were in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> much about your experiences during the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">ANSWER:  I never did speak about it, neither was my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">My father being the extrovert kind of a person started to write a drama, drama and he named it, “Oh Hear Me World.” </span><span class="sentence" id="766">He never finished it. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">It was translated by a friend into English. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">He wrote it in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">He liked to talk about his experiences but we never did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">QUESTION:  When did you personally decide to speak publicly about your experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">ANSWER:  In 1995. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">I had joined a certain organization through the Jewish community, Jewish Federation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L.A.</span> They had some programs, cultural programs and I came upon certain people. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">They were child survivors in different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , in <span class="REGION">Scandinavian countries</span> and they were telling of their experiences as orphans being taken to a priest, by priests into, Jesuits and <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and lived in <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And they had the most interesting stories to tell and finally I joined them. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Although I did not speak much on my experience, I had this feeling that I belonged to a certain group, that is child survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">In 1995, my son being a student at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Pennsylvania</span> , visited <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and visited the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and came back and had asked me to talk about my experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Although I never did speak to my children about it, I did speak to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> students at the Jewish Federation and I became a docent at the Museum of the Holocaust in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L.A.</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">QUESTION:  What sort of long-term impact do you feel the Holocaust has had on your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">ANSWER:  In the past I did not think that it had any impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I just was so involved with succeeding in life and, and pursuing what I wanted to do in my life and, and medicine was my only goal in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And then I got married and I had two beautiful successful children and I think I instilled upon them the same love of learning and that there was my all, my whole awareness was the presence, the present, not thinking of the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Now that I start dwelling on the past and seeing that, I had no childhood, that I had lived this life in hiding and during persecutions and a very unusual childhood, I, I begin to realize that it, I think it made me a stronger person although I cannot imagine how it would have been had I had a normal childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">QUESTION:  Have you started to write about your experiences as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">ANSWER:  I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I had been encouraged by certain people in the <span class="DLF">newspaper field</span> to, after they saw my story in a videotape, to write down those experiences and I decided to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And it’s slow because I’m still very much involved in medicine and it just leading a normal, busy professional life. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">But one of these days, Ill retreat and do some more recollections, putting it down on papers so that maybe my children and their children can read about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">As of today, my daughter still doesn’t know what her mother went through and what a life she has had during her childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">QUESTION:  Would you mind reading just for a moment or two, a selection from, some of your memoirs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">ANSWER:  This is entitled, “A Day in the Life of a Hidden Child.” </span><span class="sentence" id="791">It was a day as it was in those times, a dark <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> , a horse, a high stack of hay. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">This, this hay occupied a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> almost up to the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">Two little girls, motionless, lying side by side, communicating only with a whisper, a sigh. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Sharing the same destiny for no reason or fault of their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Each different, each from different corners of the world, thrown into a doomed fate of struggle and despair. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Both cuddling an imaginary dream on their worn-out blanket, the color of hay to blend in with. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">The <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> was small, only <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to sit but not to stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">The position assumed was horizontal, laying down only, to reduce friction, to conserve energy, time of the day judged by the sounds of the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Sunrise by the crowing of the rooster, sundown by the return of the villagers from the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Sundays and holidays by the presence of the horse in the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> , by the small ration of milk instead of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">At the crack of the dawn, the farmer would enter the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , getting the horse ready for a day’s work. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">He would carry a pail of water, some of which we would share with the horse and a piece of dry bread under his shirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">With a cough, he would signal his approach, produce a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> and place it at the edge of the hay. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">He would place then, the water and the bread at the edge and then quickly disappear removing the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> as quick as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">This exchange was so fast, was so quick that we never had the chance to see his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Time was of essence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="807">QUESTION:  And before we conclude, will you just let me know after you were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , when did you return to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> and where you lived after that, briefly?</span></p>
