<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">My dad had a furniture workshop and mom was a housekeeper, <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , homemaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">We were three small children. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And we lived in what was known as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> , which encompassed sort of six, seven <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">We went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , Friday night we had a Sabbath dinner, Saturday we went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , but Saturday afternoon sometimes we snuck off to the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And life was pleasant, you know, with three sisters, sometimes we played together, other times we fought, we did homework, there was a beautiful clock at the end of our <span class="DLF">street</span> , and after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we'd go and play there, we'd ride our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> , we'd play ball on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> next to our <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> and life kind of was pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">It was pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">On the week-end, on Sundays, neighbors, friends, everybody'd get on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> , we'd go the <span class="DLF">park</span> , have a picnic. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And the <span class="DLF">park</span> was a beautiful <span class="DLF">park</span> , 1t was called the <span class="DLF">Lanekevitzstrak(ph) Park</span> and had a beautiful <span class="DLF">pond</span> with swans and we enjoyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I re-visited it recently and, seems smaller than it did when I was small. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And, everything seemed alright for awhile and what I didn't realize, however, was that the, there was a depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And that my dad was having financial problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">He eventually lost his business which was, he had a <span class="BUILDING">furniture workshop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He made custom <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">He lost it. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And then went off to the <span class="DLF">coal mines</span> to get work. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">People tried to get work just about wherever they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And, he even worked for the Fourth Company for a short while. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And then eventually got a position with a <span class="BUILDING">steamship company</span> and started sailing the seven seas. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And this was about early '36, '37. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And at that time we had gone back, we had gone, I wouldn't say back exactly, my mom did go back, but we went with my mom to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> because my family originated from there, and that was the last time I saw my grandfather, my grandmother and many of my aunts and uncles. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Most of them did perish in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">By 1937, we rarely saw my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We always saw him like every three months, every four months, when he'd come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for about two or three days and then would take off again. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">At about the same time, he made the acquaintance of an officer on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamship</span> , on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamship</span> he worked on, the man was a German and a Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And I'm mentioning that because he'll be coming into our lives later on again. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Otherwise, I wouldn't have identified him like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Carl would not always be able to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> docked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> to see his family because time was short, so he would stay with us and we became very fond of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">In 1938, there was an influx of refugees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">They came from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the whole Jewish community opened up their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">We, ourselves, in our small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , had four people staying with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I think it was four, I'm not sure if 1t was three or four, but from what I remember, there were two couples. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dinner table</span> a lot of talk was going on about what went on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , about what I know now to be Chrystalnacht(ph), and I remember becoming fearful, I remember going to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and thinking about it and I say, well, maybe we're going to have to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And I would ask my mother about it, and she said, don't worry, old people tell stories, they're exaggerating. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">She says, nothing's happening, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they're civilized <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">The people there are like here, she says, maybe some things are happening, after all, you know, I always tell you that there are people who are antisemetic, and who don't like Jews, but nothing like what they're telling you. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So, time went on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Let me just, before you go further, just ask, you said that you lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Did you have contact with Christian people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Oh, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> and then after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> the boys went to what they called <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> and the little girls went to what they called <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We learned how to read and write in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Of course we had contact because in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> it was mixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I didn't go to a secular, I mean I went to a <span class="BUILDING">secular school</span> , I didn't go to a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So, yes, we did have contact, but the reason I mentioned the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> , is, there were Jewish people living all over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> that I'm speaking of was, I would almost say 90% Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">There were Christians living there also, but it was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where you had all the kosher butchers, you had <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> almost on every second <span class="DLF">street</span> , and <span class="BUILDING">kosher restaurants</span> , and if you really walk those <span class="DLF">streets</span> you really didn't think there was another world. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">As a matter of fact, until I went to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , I spoke just Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I didn't know there were other languages, except the Hungarian and Rumanian that I heard my parents speak, which I never learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So, for me, until I went into regular public school, I thought that the only people who existed were Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">But then, of course, I came in contact with everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And speaking of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , in many of the <span class="REGION">European countries</span> , <span class="BUILDING">school</span> isn't five days a week like here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">You go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, full days. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Thursday is a half day and then a half day on Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So, we were not excused from that, although many times, we were absent on Saturdays. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">However, when we did go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , our teacher would excuse us from reading, I mean from writing on the board or writing in our notebooks and then I had one teacher who sat us in the back of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> so she would remember who not to call on to write. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And that wasn't overly comfortable, but it was something that we adjusted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And, okay, going back to '38, '39, there was, I remember hearing talk about <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> being invaded and I heard talk about <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> being neutral, but it was very vague at that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">It wasn't until later that I learned the full history of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">In 1940, the spring of 1940, I was at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">In <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , you had socialized medicine, you also had a system whereby poor children were offered what they called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fresh Air Camp</span> experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And you would be able to go away for about two weeks to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fresh Air Camp</span> to kind of be physically rehabilitated, get good food, get fresh air so that we'd stay healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So, I was sent to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for two weeks and one of my sisters was sent to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And I remember the morning, this is very clear in my mind, the morning of May 10, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">We were sitting and, to the best of my recollection, having breakfast in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> , and the radio was playing some music, the music was stopped and an announcement was made that the German armies are walking into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Which shocked the counselors, everyone, they practically jumped out of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And rushed us to finish our breakfast. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Took us back to the <span class="BUILDING">dorms</span> , we had to pack our little bags, they got us onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> and took us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I got there, I remember getting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and I remember the <span class="DLF">streets</span> being full of people, rushing back and forth and talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It was very chaotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Very chaotic. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Almost, you know looking back on it now, is I can understand it, what happened is everybody was caught by surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Nobody expected it. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And people were packing up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , and this holds true for both the Christian and the Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Everyone was running. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Because from what I learned later on, is the Belgians were as afraid of the Germans as anybody else would be, at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Because during World War II, there was a lot of resistance in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and...World War I, I'm sorry, I apologize. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">World War I. There was a lot of resistance in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And, from what I heard at the time, was that the, a lot of torturing took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So Belgians were tortured and they were frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I don't have, myself, any specific cases that I could document, but it's sort of one of these known facts within the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So, everybody was running. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Now, we had a slight problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">My mother and the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">By then, of course, remember I said my father was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Meanwhile, unbeknownst to us, my father's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in '38, had docked in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and he had a sister who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , who had been sent there after World War I because her father had been killed on the front and there was an aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> who was willing to take in the little girl and raise her. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So, my father called her from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and she says, have you heard? </span><span class="sentence" id="88">This was after November of 1938, have you heard what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And my father says, no, what are you talking about? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">She says, don't go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">He says, what do you mean, don't go back? </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I've got my wife, I've got the two children, I've got to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And she urged him to stay and she sent someone for him and they illegally brought him into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I shouldn't even say this, but he became legalized. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">He eventually entered the American Army, served honorably and was honorably discharged. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">As soon as he got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and settled down, they started making arrangements to bring us to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">That, they encountered great difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">First of all, my father wasn't here legally, as yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Secondly, we, even if my uncle and aunt made the arrangements to bring us, we fell under the Rumanian quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">The Rumanian quota, as for most Eastern European Jews, was very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It could sometimes take up to 10 years, waiting to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And I came across something that was very interesting here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , in the immigration department of the years '37 through '40, immigrants were listed by <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , except for one group. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">One group was listed as Hebrews. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I'll show it to you later. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But, anyway, getting back to 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I had been sent to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> as did, my second sister was sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So, two of us had been away. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I was back now, the little one, the youngest was back. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">The middle one wasn't back yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Now, mother tried desperately to reach the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We didn't have a phone in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">She had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> to get, actually, most of the phones were at the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> , to try to call. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Somehow, she couldn't get through. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And had absolutely no knowledge where my middle sister was. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Someone with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trundle seat</span> in the back, getting ready to escape to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , because that's where everybody was heading, everybody was heading towards <span class="REGION">Northern France</span> , offered us a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> if we would just go right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And my mother had a terrible dilemma. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Does she take two of us and go, does she wait for the third one and get stuck and lose all the children, as well? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And I learned later, of course, at that time I didn't know, although she talked about it, I had a vague recollection of what she was telling me. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Because I remember her saying, Florika(ph), that's a diminutive in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> for Flora, we have to try to find Charlotte so we can leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But, I remember her also saying, if I can't find her, maybe we should go anyway and see if we can find her later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And, while she was pondering this question, which I now as a mother and a grandmother, I realize it's one of the most difficult ones you ever have to do, and I hope that no mother ever has to ponder this kind of dilemma. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">She kept talking, but at the same time she started packing some little bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">My youngest sister at the time had the measles and she had a high fever, which was another problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">The people who had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> kept saying, we're leaving, we're not waiting any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And she kept begging them, wait a little while longer, maybe they'll bring my Charlotte. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Finally, they said, no, we're going. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And she made a decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">She told one of the neighbors who had decided not to go, to wait out the war or whatever was coming, she says, if my Charlotte comes, please keep her for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And we got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trundle seat</span> in the back, it was an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> , and we, we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So, it was the two of us and my mom. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And her idea was that if we can get to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , maybe to Calais(ph), and maybe get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> , maybe from there, and she was, pure fantasy. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We had no Visas, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But, somehow, this is the plan that she had made. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">From <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> to get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So, we went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  Was this kind of exciting for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Or scary?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  I remember, what I remember is not understanding why we're not waiting for Charlotte. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">That I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And, it was, I don't know, I can't explain it, it was frightening, I don't remember being excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I don't remember being excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">It was a lot of chaos, and it was, it was strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But, I can't say excited in the sense of feeling like I'm living a drama or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">No, I don't recall anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I just remember it being very chaotic, very strange, and I remember having to, to just sit in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and clutching my doll, I had a fairly new doll that I had gotten just before I had gone away to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And I remember clutching my doll and holding on to her, to the doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">My mother placed the little one on my lap, and I remember her being very hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So, there were very, there were many physical things going on, so mentally, I don't remember too many sensations. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I remember being uncomfortable, I remember trying to hold my doll, I remember my sister who was very hot, being placed on my lap, and not understanding why Charlotte wasn't coming with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">That was the middle sister that we couldn't find.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  What else did you take with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  We had two suitcases. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They were large in my eyes, but I learned later on that they weren't quite that big. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They also started feeling very heavy later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Anyway, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> went, you couldn't go, you could walk faster than you could ride because, as I said, everybody was running. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And, what I didn't learn until later on, is that we were part of the refugees that blocked the <span class="DLF">roads</span> which prevented the Allies, the Allies were the French and some of the British, from pulling back, or trying to get through on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We, because I remember, this was after the war, I remember reading and learning about the <span class="DLF">roads</span> being blocked by refugees, and I learned then that we were part of that group of refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> ran out of gas, there wasn't any to be gotten, so they just, the people left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , so we left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and then we were on our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We slept in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , wherever you could just find a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">With our suitcases. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Or a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> somewhere, if a farmer allowed you to stay in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And we did, we did make it to Calais(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="163">QQ: — __ ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Well, we did get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for a short while, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped in the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> , people had to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">It took several days. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Neither myself or my mom remembered precisely how many days, but it was several days. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I remember being, we were in a <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , and this was in Calais(ph), but not near the <span class="DLF">port</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And we were, our plan was at that point, mom decided, well, maybe we shouldn't just go to the <span class="DLF">port</span> to try to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Great Britain</span> , maybe we should just try to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , maybe that would be safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So, we were in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , and I remember being very tired and we had slept on our suitcases in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and then we decided to just abandon one suitcase because mom had to carry my little sister who was four, and who, not quite, this was in May and she wasn't four until the following, the next month, June. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">What's happening to my English? </span><span class="sentence" id="171">It's funny, when I get emotional, I lose my ability to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We left one suitcase in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I remember we hid it behind a corner because we were afraid someone would see us and run after us and tell us we left a suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">We thought that was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">We then went to the <span class="DLF">port</span> and we, I sat on a suitcase, the one suitcase that we had left, with my little sister and my mother saw a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and they were loading soldiers on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And she went over there and she spoke to someone. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I didn't know who she spoke to, but she spoke to someone and when she came back she said, we're going to wait here, maybe they'll take us, they're going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So, we sat. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And we sat through the night and they kept loading wounded soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">By dawn, the man mom had spoken to walked over to us and he said, sorry, there's no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , it's full. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And he couldn't take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So, we tried to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">As we were walking away, we saw people screaming, anybody want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , there's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> here, you can come, every, people just loaded onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I learned later that this was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that was abandoned and someone who knew how to steer just took the, just went in took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and invited people to come onto it. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Because, I mean, it's incredible and it's difficult to describe, what things looked like. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It was just, people were running and coming and going and nothing was the way nor...quote, normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And we decided, great, we're going to go onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So, we came and we went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Now, there were, it wasn't a very large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , but it was still good size. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And there were <span class="INT_SPACE">cabins</span> , and we sat against a <span class="DLF">wall</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> , on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , against a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabin</span> , but facing the <span class="DLF">dock</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Other people sat on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> facing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And, I'm saying this for a reason, what happened, once the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> was full, suddenly the tide went down as it typically does towards evening, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> tilted. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">The people on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> started sliding down because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> kept tilting. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We ended up sitting on the <span class="DLF">cabin wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">But, we were safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And, of course, they did manage to save most of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">They threw them <span class="DLF">ladders</span> and we were all pulled up. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">From there we found a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , we gave up on going to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">We found a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and the Red Cross was giving out milk for children and things like that, so we got a little milk and then we went out to try to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">As we were walking the <span class="DLF">street</span> , the sirens came on and we ended up in a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">bomb shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We stayed there for awhile, when the clear siren rang, mom said, you know what, you stay here with Betty, I'll go find us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So, she left me in the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> and I sat there by myself with my little sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And I sat and I waited and I waited and I waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And then after awhile I panicked. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And I went out of the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> with my little sister, meanwhile she kept crying, she was thirsty, and I had nothing to give her. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So, the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were deserted and they were fairly dark, and I walked screaming, mamma, mamma, mamma, all of a sudden I hear someone calling, Flora, Flora, Flora. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Mom had forgotten where she had left us, because we didn't know Calais(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So, she was walking the <span class="DLF">streets</span> hoping that I would have left the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> maybe, and she kept calling and hoping that I would hear and I was calling, so we did find each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">At that point, we went, found another <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , well, to make a long story short, because this was lengthy, we ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bulangsumere(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="211">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bulangsumere(ph</span> ) we stayed put. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">By then the German Army had walked into <span class="REGION">Northern France</span> , and we got stuck in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bulangsumere(ph</span> ), so we stayed there, we found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay with a woman who had a <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> and mom helped her so that we could eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And we were there for, I would say, about five or six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">By then an order came out that anyone who was not a legal resident of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> must return to their countries of origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So, we decided to return to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">We started walking back, transportation was a mess, you couldn't even get on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , rails were bombed and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And we hitchhiked. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">As a matter of fact, with German soldiers, we did hitchhike. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Anyway, we made it back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> ...
QUESTION:  With German soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  Yeah, right, we hitchhiked, the German Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Well, the Germans, we're in <span class="REGION">Northern France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And we needed to get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , so...
QUESTION:  And they gave you a ride?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  They gave us a ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Of course, they didn't know who we were, what we were, you know, but they didn't give us a ride all the way, just, you know, piecemeal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  One question. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I think I recall in an earlier interview you did, you talked about seeing a lot of looting and...
ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Okay, here's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">While mom was helping the woman working in the <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> and everything else, my little sister and I, we wandered the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And every time you had sirens and you had the bombing, <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were bombed, <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were broken, and people, people broke <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And we passed, it was a <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> that we had, we kept pass, 1t was more than a <span class="BUILDING">shoe store</span> , because they also had clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And there was a pair of white boots in the <span class="DLF">window</span> [laughter], it was kind of a silly thing in the middle of a war, but anyway, it was a pair of white boots that I kept looking at. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I just, oh, would I love to have those white boots! </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Anyway, this particular day, my sister and I were walking and we see a lot of people in front of this <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And we get there and we see people walking out with packages, the <span class="DLF">window</span> was broken, it was an absolute mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And I saw, so I went over, and I somehow, we made our way into the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and I see the white boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And I grabbed the white boots and there was two rain coats, another kind of a coat, and I grabbed that and a pair of boots for my sister, and we ran out. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I didn't even try them on. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I just thought, approximately, I just grabbed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Anyway, they did fit. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And I loved them. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And she loved hers. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And we, and the rain coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And we come back, I come to the <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> , and the first thing my mother says is, what in the world is that? </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So, I told her, I says, everybody was taking, you know, the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was open, everybody was taking. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So, she was, I learned later, at the time she just said, you're not supposed to take things you don't pay for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But, she did not take them away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">We kept them. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Anyway, one day [laughter] I was, you know, in the middle of chaos, in the middle of such dramatic times, there were these moments that there is some humor to it in a way, but I didn't laugh at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">One day, I'm walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and all of a sudden I feel somebody grabbing me by the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">It was the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And he made me take off the boots and the rain coat, which I wore sunshine or rain or whatever, so that was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Is that what you were referring to? </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Well, I didn't steal for a long time, I was told later on that this was stealing. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So my mother was in a dilemma at that time, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="258">It wasn't a time where you taught children honesty or not, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="259">You survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Anyhow, we came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">There were a few incidents, like I would brag, you know, really, you want to get food, you know, if you were little, even adults would push you aside, okay, get away, get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And they were stronger, so they would push you out of <span class="DLF">line</span> , because they wanted the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">But, anyway, we made it, we got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and one of the neighbors did have Charlotte. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Charlotte, I don't know whether she ever speaks about it, as a matter of fact, she was just interviewed by the Spielberg(ph) project and I don't know if she ever, can you edit this out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  We're not going to edit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  Oh, you're not going to edit. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Well then, well anyway, I don't know if she ever forgave mom. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I don't know if she's mentioned it even, but I must ask her, but I don't know if she ever forgave mom. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I don't think she ever understood why mamma took off without her. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And she asked a few times, and mom could not explain it. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">She kept saying, I thought I could save two children instead of losing three. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">That was her answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And there were difficult decisions to be made. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I felt sorry for mom, because that's, I know this was something that was always on her mind, it was always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Anyway, we settled back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , and, except for bombs, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> that we heard, seeing German soldiers in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , life took up a normal routine again. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">September, we went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">By October, however, Jews were supposed to register. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Registering was that you had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">municipal building</span> , , administration and register. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Now, the question comes up sometimes, well, what if you didn't register? </span><span class="sentence" id="280">You were known because in Europe, people carry identity cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">After the war when I turned 15, I received an identity card. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">As a matter of fact, I carry one, I still have it, it says, stranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , nationality, <span class="COUNTRY">Rumanian</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">The Rumanians never recognized me as a Rumanian national, and the Belgians didn't recognize me as a Belgian national. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">It's something I always resented. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And, so whether you wanted to or not, you were registered, but you had to officially register. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So, mom registered, everybody did. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">The attitude was that, if you obey the law, you'll be fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And, a little later on, men were called up for forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">My mother's youngest sister also lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And she had a little boy who was born early in 1940, and her husband had escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">He came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> around, oh somewheres around '38, just about that time when they got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And my uncle was called up. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">He went. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And he came back three months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Many of the men went and they came back three months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="298">If we obey, if we do what we're supposed to do, it's no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Then, my uncle was called up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">My mother had almost like a sixth sense about things. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">She lived a lot by intuition, but it served her well. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">She said at one point, she said, Alex, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I don't think you should go. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And he did listen, and he took his wife and child and they escaped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> it was easier to get lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">It had a small, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sashiel(ph</span> ), one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> , it had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , but it wasn't quite as big or as defined as the one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> was almost, a good part of it was what you call almost like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> you could get lost a little bit more. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Then, you know, as time went on, we wore the star, it wasn't any fun to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with the star, but we didn't have to worry about it too long because we were told you couldn't go to, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , you couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , the Jewish children were still going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">QUESTION:  What, what were you doing for money? </span><span class="sentence" id="312">For food, or...
ANSWER:  Mom worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Mom worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">She did some dressmaking and we each had a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I did handwork, I hemmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Because lace was hard to obtain, so you made little scallops on the bottom of slips, on top, we made women's slips, so I was in charge of the scallops. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">One of my sisters was in charge of turning, we made, mom made, of straps. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">You see, things are different today. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">To make straps, you made kind of a little tube and then you turned it inside out with a safety pin, and then you attached it to the slip, and one of my sisters was in charge of turning the straps inside out. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And then one of us would deliver it, because they were piecemeal, they were made for someone and then we would deliver it, and, she also worked in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , because by her working in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> we were able to go have dinner there, so it helped with the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">She was always a very hard worker, even when she came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">She's a Rock of Gibraltar, four eleven but an incredible little lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">As a matter of fact, she was one of six sisters and the only one who lived after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">The difference between her and her sisters, let me just make a comment. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I was at a conference about two weeks ago where Lyle(ph) Hilberg(ph) and Yahuda(ph) Ballo(ph) were debating whether survival depended on pure luck or whether it was the personality of individuals that helped them to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And when I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I, that whole night I thought about that, and, of course, I related it to our own personal lives, and I realized that short of physically being taken and killed, a lot of it had to do with personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Knowing when to take advantage of an opportunity and acting upon it without too much debate, without too much reflection. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">To move, to constantly move. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Mom was like that, but she had been a rebel way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">She came from a very religious orthodox family in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">She was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siget(ph</span> ) which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> and lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And she was the only one of six sisters who decided to leave and go to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So there was part of a rebel, not someone who is going to just sit still and let life lead her. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">She eventually brought her younger sister to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And the same thing happened during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I know you want me to talk chronologically, but let me jump ahead a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">At one point when we were going into hiding, the problem you ran into with that was that the people who would hide you, particularly there was an official, not an official, an organized network in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> that hid children, but they couldn't tell you where they would take the children to. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Because if you were caught, what you didn't know you couldn't tell, should you be tortured. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So, they didn't tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">My aunt wouldn't let her child go, she could not bring herself to let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">My mom took the risk, we're alive, my little cousin is not. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">When my aunt and uncle were already in our clandestine <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , which they never left in more than eight months, and my mother begged them to accompany her to another <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , my aunt's attitude was, there's no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to run, they'll find us, where are we gonna run? </span><span class="sentence" id="343">My aunt is not alive, she died at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and mom lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Because mom, that does not mean that mom could not have gotten caught, but she still, she kept acting, she kept moving and trying. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Anyway, going back...
QUESTION:  I wanted you to talk to me a little bit more about the various restrictions placed upon Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and how you felt about that, how it impacted you, your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , your play, everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">We couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">At one point we couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Actually, yeah, we were supposed to go to a, <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> were still operating a little bit, but technically, we couldn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Then Jews had to give up their radios. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Jews had to give up their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And there was this constant attitude, well, if we do what we're told to do, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> is very important in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I mean, people practically lived on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">But that, okay, so you give up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , so you give up this. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Then, but there was, you became upset, you became angry because you couldn't have your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> any more, because you couldn't have radios any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Also, once we started wearing the star, we didn't risk as much going out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">We didn't live in an official <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , as they did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and places like that, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but for all practical purposes, once we wore the star we might as well have lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Because, you didn't dare venture out too far from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">You didn't feel comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">If you, for example, when I was, just before I was told we couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore, I would wear the star and I would go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I'd hold a book up sort of covering my star. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And youngsters would walk over and pull away the book and say, don't you know it's a crime to cover up your star? </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Which was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">It was a crime, you weren't supposed to cover it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">But, even children were drawn into that situation, and children can be cruel. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So, it did create a lot of discomfort. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">You couldn't go to the <span class="DLF">park</span> anymore, it was forbidden to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">You couldn't go to the movies, Jews weren't allowed in the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">You couldn't go to an <span class="BUILDING">ice cream parlor</span> or <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> , there were signs, signs went up different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So, you found yourself sort of retreating. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">The only saving grace, so to speak, that there was, was that you weren't alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Other kids were in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Your neighbors were in the same situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So, that kind, and you did, it was, the feelings were very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">It was, you found yourself being very, at that point, I remember becoming very unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And, not understanding why. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I knew what was going on, but what I couldn't understand is the why. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">What did we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Why us? </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I remembered before the war, we were happy, we went, we came, and then all of a sudden, everything changed, and that is where I had great difficulty, with that why. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Then there was another element for us, personally, at that point, mom got upset with dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">He's in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , he's, why did he leave us, you know, somehow thinking that if he had been there, he would have been okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">We would have all been okay, which we wouldn't have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">It would have probably even been worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">For the simple reason, being alone, she made all the decisions, she didn't have to consult and there didn't have to be a discussion as to should we, shouldn't we. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">She decided, and we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">But, it was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">My little sisters had even greater difficulty with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And I found myself constantly saying, don't worry, it'll be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">It'll be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Because there was crying, why can't we go here, why can't we go there, and why can't we do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And then food started being a problem because Jews, the rationing stamps were stopped for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">We couldn't have rationing stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Now, if you didn't have rationing stamps, you couldn't buy food. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We still had a small advantage. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Mom worked in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> as a cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So, we were able to go and have a meal there, but even that slowed down because the <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> had to start using ration stamps, so then we couldn't have, and then mom lost her job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  Were you ever turned away from anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="398">You said that all of a sudden you couldn't do this, you couldn't do that...
ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I went with my sisters, after we couldn't go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore, I remember I went, remember I mentioned the <span class="DLF">park</span> we always went to? </span><span class="sentence" id="400">It was at the end of our <span class="DLF">street</span> , it's called the <span class="DLF">Lanekevitzstrak(ph) Park</span> , at the end of our <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I remember going with my sisters to the <span class="DLF">park</span> , and there was a sign, no Jews allowed, and, but there was no <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And we walked, I said come on, we walked in and all of a sudden a guard walked out of nowhere and he looked at us and he goes, like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And I remember going... And I didn't say anything, I just remember going like this, so we had to turn around and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And my little sisters were devastated, because we went there every day, it was like natural, 1t was our, quote, our <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">You know, that's where we had picnics on the week- ends with the friends and neighbors, that's where we went after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , our <span class="DLF">park</span> , and we couldn't go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">We used to go to the movies, and we couldn't go to the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">We used to go get ice cream, and we couldn't get ice cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So, there were a lot of things, and we started finding our way of life sort of narrowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">A friend of mine wrote her biography, autobiography, and she called the book, the Shrinking Circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">But that's exactly what it was, sort of your world started shrinking and getting smaller and smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">So, we found ourselves ending up just never really going far from the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> we lived in and just playing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">But, again, there were other kids in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413">So, we ended up playing together and, you know, children have a way, though, of surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So, while this was all going on, as I said, my uncle and aunt had already left and they started coming and arresting people. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Not many, one, two, and then later on they came with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> that was about the size of, you know, the small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> that we have? </span><span class="sentence" id="416">It would come around, it would stop, a siren would get off, four or five Gestapo men would just jump out, go into a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , pull out a couple of people, take off with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  What people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Well, we assumed that it was people who had broken some kind of law, who hadn't obeyed a law, who must have done something, this was an assumption at first, must have done something wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">But, it increased and increased. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And then we realized that they started arresting people, also rumors started reaching us. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">You know, it was very interesting, they did things in such a way that, if somehow you had contact, managed to contact someone from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and you would tell them, they would say, what are you talking about? </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Nothing was done in a manner simultaneously in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> or across an entire <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">When they were arresting people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , they were still not arresting in, I mean, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> they were still not arresting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Or in another part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">It was, they were, they were incredible psychologists. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">They were, the same way with my uncle I said going off for forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">You do what you're told to do, we won't touch your wife and child. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And at first, that's exactly what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And then people started, like I said, being arrested and not coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">By then, just about that time, all of a sudden, one day, Carl shows up, my father's friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">The Christian officer of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that he had been on. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">We had not heard from him from the time that dad had jumped <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="433">It seemed that he had been attached to the Commandant Tour in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , and, you know, I've been wracking my brain trying to remember his last name, and I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I had, just before my mom died in '92, I kept, the last few years, it didn't occur to me, I always thought of Carl, I never thought of his last name, and it wasn't until here, in the last few years just before mom died, that it all of a sudden occurred to me that I didn't know Carl's last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And I asked her and she says, Oh, my God, I've forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">She could not recall his last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So, this is something that escapes me to this day, is his last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But anyway, he showed up one day, and mom, of course, 1s worried, she saw a uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Because by then we started getting very nervous if anybody in uniform came to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And he says, just relax, he says, how are you, how is David? </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Have you heard from him? </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So, she had to tell him that we hadn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">How are the children? </span><span class="sentence" id="444">He came around a few times and brought us food, but then some of neighbors are saying, what are you doing with this German? </span><span class="sentence" id="445">What are you doing with this Deutsche(ph)? </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So, she begged him, she says, don't come. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">She says, I'll manage. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">One day he did show up. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Didn't stay, just came, very quickly, brusquely said, Fanny, take the kids, if you can get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , go. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And she says, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="452">He says, just do what I tell you to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Turns around and takes off. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Didn't even wait to, I can't, looking at it now, thinking back, I think he, himself, probably was afraid, because he was Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Although, mom seemed to remember and, see I remember him being Army, mom seemed to remember that he had a black uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Now, if indeed the uniform was black, then he was attached to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">So there, I have a little, there's a little cloud there. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I'm not 100% sure whether he was or was not attached to the Gestapo.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">QUESTION:  Did he suggest where you should go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Nothing, he didn't even stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And I remember that, I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">He just didn't even stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Just took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Mom didn't hesitate, she immediately, she took off my star, she took off her star and she put a double layer of clothing on each of us, and we took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , where are we going to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We're going to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">To, because somehow, through people, my aunt had let us know where she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">So we knew where to find her. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And by then, people still weren't really going underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">The only ones at that point, that were really going underground, were people who were, like my uncle, who refused to go again for forced labor, who didn't show up, people like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And, of course, unfortunately, those who disappeared or those who might have been . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">We had a problem, mother's card by then, when we registered and we got the stars and everything, they stamped everyone's identity card in two languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">in French and Yode(ph) in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So, mom's card was stamped. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And you could be stopped at any point, anytime, you could be stopped on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , there were always <span class="DLF">checkpoints</span> , no matter where you went, so we, basically, had to pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">We get a ticket, 40 minutes later you can get off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , it's very simple, very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">However, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> can be stopped at any time, so if they stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they came in and they would ask for documents, we would be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">By then there was already a lot of suspicion that people were being deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">There were rumors and, but people didn't know exactly, but you knew you were in danger.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Q: What did you change your name to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  Fiers, F-I-E-R-S. And, we didn't change our first names because they were Belgian enough and secular enough, so people who were named Sarah or Abraham, you know, they changed their names totally.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  I, let me give you a few incidences. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">For example, one day we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , my two sisters and I, mom was at work. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And I remember we were standing near the <span class="DLF">window</span> , looking out, and we saw a group of Blackshirts, who were Belgian Nazis, coming into the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us there was a small <span class="BUILDING">book store</span> , actually the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> had Jewish books, , which were the prayer shawls, and all kinds of Judaica. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">The broke the <span class="DLF">window</span> , they stormed into that <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> and I remember them pulling out the old man who ran it. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">He had a long beard, they literally, they pulled at the beard and they pulled his side locks to the side and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And then they threw him down in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I remember they kicked him, they literally kicked him with their boots, and I remember we stood near the <span class="DLF">window</span> holding each other and shaking, the three of us, we were just devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And we were frozen, but yet, we stood at the <span class="DLF">window</span> , looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">It was one of the more difficult moments. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">The other time, I remember we had gone for a walk, because we still walked out and, you know, we didn't stay confined yet at that point, and I remember seeing a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fire wagons</span> at the big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and there was a crowd of people around it. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And I looked and the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was burning and the, they put the fire, they waited, they weren't putting the fire out and that's what I remember was bothering me. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I didn't see the firemen, I remember seeing the firemen standing and not doing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And only after a while, I saw them go in and putting out the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I didn't learn until after the war that they had strict orders not to put the fire out until the fire threatened the adjoining <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">But, at that time, I didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I just saw . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">But, before the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was burning, I was there just, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I remember seeing, while the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was burning, I remember also seeing a pile of books and Torah Scrolls laying messed up in front of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and I was told after, I also learned afterward, that they had been pulled out first and dumped in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So, but basically, what I saw was the crowd of people, the firemen doing nothing and the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> burning. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And it wasn't until afterwards that I learned how the whole thing had proceeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And I remember being scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I remember being quite scared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">QUESTION:  Now, you, it sounds like you and your sisters were on your own a bit, did your mother...
ANSWER:  We were on our own a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  ...leave instruction with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Did she, did she kind of tell you what was going on and how to act differently?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">ANSWER:  Uh...
QUESTION:  You were in charge of both of your sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  No, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Me, she told. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">She also let us know, all three of us, that if we didn't behave a certain way, that we could get hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Basically, that we could get hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Later on, we learned from my mother that if we didn't behave or act in a certain way, if we didn't remember our false name and things like that, that we could be taken away and killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">She didn't say by whom or how, but that, basically, was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Me, she told me more, and she says that all the things that I had heard before the war were true. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">That was the first time I was, you know, by '41 or so, that I started learning that the things that she had said before the war that the people were exaggerating, that, of course, they weren't really exaggerating, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  When you say behave in a certain way, what does that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">A, to be very, very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">To never draw attention to ourselves by anything that we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And the biggest thing, once we ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , was to never forget our false name and to never forget that we were, quote, not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">That we were Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And, as for me, if someone asked, I was supposed to say that I had already had my first communion. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I didn't even know what it was, but, those are basically, you know, some of the orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="572">QUESTION:  Were there things you had to learn at this point about being Christian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">ANSWER:  Not yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Not yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="576">That was only if we were approached. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">But no one approached us. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">As long as we remembered our false name, at this point we were okay, because we were still living in a very secular world. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">But, we weren't really out, once we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , except for the few weeks that we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and just going back, we didn't really move around too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">The only other <span class="NPIP">place</span> that we went was to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that was across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where mom had gotten a job working as a housekeeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Because by now things are getting very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to really work any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Don't forget, this wasn't <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> where she was sewing and working at the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Once we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , she couldn't really work legally anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So, she cleaned the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And, but that, you know, things didn't last, it wasn't that, it only lasted a few weeks and then what happened is, after my, Charlotte, 1t was the middle one, it was always Charlotte for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Charlotte had a fight with this child in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , we learned that, later on, that even the instructors at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> were worried about this child. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Because when this child said some, I'll get my brother on you, there was good reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Her brother was a Belgian Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Everyone in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was afraid of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">The principal, one day, said to me, Flora, ask your mother to come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And by then I said the other kids had already had gotten these slips of papers and I later learned what it said. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">For example, they got them on a Friday and they were, the paper basically said, told the parents or whoever were the guardians, that on the Monday following this Friday, I have no date to give you here, you know, all I remember is it was a Friday, they were to report to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">To the best of my knowledge, those children reported, but never came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I have no documentation of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">That's word of mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">That is what I learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And when mom came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , her first reaction was, and my reaction when the principal told me this, well, we didn't do anything, we were good, because they never called parents to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="599">See, there was no thing about parent-teachers association, you didn't have that over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">When a parent was called to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it was because a child did not behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So, my reaction was, well, we're good, my sisters are good, we didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And she says, no, I know you didn't do anything, I want to talk to mom. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So, when, meanwhile, just prior to that, also, all that was happening within those same weeks, she realized that we didn't have really warm winter coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So, she had made arrangements for us to receive a winter coat and also receive a glass of milk every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">That was like for poor children, but what we didn't know is that those winter coats and the milk came from an industrialist, Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Rausank(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="607">He was the patron, we didn't have, as I said, parent-teacher associations, but what you had is patrons of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And which a rich industrialist or another wealthy individual would take a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> under their patronage and give poor children clothing, vitamins, all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Rausank(ph) happened to be the patron of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , , where we were going to. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And when mom came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , of course, her first reaction, too, when I told her the principal wanted to see her was, what did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I said, mamma, we didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And I answered for my two little children because they didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">So, she did go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the principal said, Madame , she called her, said Mrs. Fiers, I know you're Jewish and I'd like to help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And mom denied up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And she says, look, let's not waste time arguing, I will put you in contact with Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Rausank(ph), and he, I think it's time for the children to be hidden.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">QUESTION:  Now, before we go into that chapter, I just have a couple additional questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">When, after moving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , did you ever have occasion to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , what was that...
ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I should have mentioned that earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">Once we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , at first, when Carl told us to leave, mom reacted, like I said, put a double layer of clothing on us, we took off, we ended up, and we made it safely to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Once we were settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , it was, I don't even know, I think it was no more than about 48 hours later, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">It was within a day or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">If even the same night, I don't remember the exact time period, at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I'm getting old and my memory is starting to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">That's why I'm glad we're doing this, in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">She said, Florika(ph), you're going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , you're going to warn everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">You're going to tell them that something's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And, I didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">She says, my attitude was, why don't you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="631">She says, you're a child, you can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">You don't have an identity card. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">You see, children didn't walk around with identity cards unless they were Jewish and wore the star. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">She says, you'll go, you'll tell everybody that's something's going to happen and then you'll come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So, the one thing, we always obeyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">My mother, we did not disobey my mother, ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Of course, if we could help it, but, we did obey. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , and I was looking for someone to tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">The <span class="DLF">streets</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> were extremely quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I didn't see anybody in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> were quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I walked around, I saw nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And I started feeling very frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I wanted to leave and go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">However, how could I go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> without telling somebody? </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I had to obey and fulfill what mom had told me to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">As I was walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , there was one <span class="DLF">street</span> that was called the, I believe it was the Laminerestratt(ph), I was walking, it was starting to get towards evening, and I was always very afraid of the dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I still am. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And I saw it getting between day and night and I said, I really want to go back, but I didn't do what I was supposed to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And while I was walking and debating what to do, I hear a knock near the bottom of my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And I look down and I see a hand saying...it was someone who was related to us, like a distant cousins and relatives who were in, down near that, it was like a <span class="DLF">cellar window</span> , like one of those little <span class="DLF">cellar windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I knew how to get into that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I went down two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and went in and I made my way down to that <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">There were several people holed up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And they said, what are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I thought you left. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And I said, well, mamma sent me back to tell everybody to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">That something's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">She says, you're a little bit late. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">What had happened is, just shortly after we left, came 1n with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they emptied several of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">That, there were people, there were still Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , but that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">quarter,</span> except for people that they missed, like those people that they missed. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">So, I said to them, well, you better come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And they said, no, we have food for several weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And there's no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">We'll just stay put. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">See, there was that, you know, you had sort of a mixed bag, you know, people say, why did Jews go like sheep to the slaughter? </span><span class="sentence" id="668">They didn't go like sheep to the slaughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">But there were people who did become paralyzed, that's the only way I can describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">If they became paralyzed like, we can't, where are we going to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="671">There was, there was a panic that set in, that kind of paralyzed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">There was like a disbelief also. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Because here you, don't forget, Belgtum was a very free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">You were able to walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and say, I'm a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I mean, very tolerant, the Belgian government paid for <span class="BUILDING">parochial schools</span> be they Jewish, be they Christian, Catholic, Protestant, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">See, but in that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , even though you did have the fascists, you did have those components, but on the whole, the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was a comfortable <span class="NPIP">place</span> for people of any religion to live in. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So, a lot of people did become sort of, like I said, paralyzed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">QUESTION:  And that was your sense at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  That was my sense at the time, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I was frustrated, I remember being frustrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I remember I said, no, mamma said you've got to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">You have to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">So, and I, like I felt like I couldn't leave, they were like, they were upsetting me, I was actually getting upset because I was supposed to tell them that they have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And, they didn't, I left myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">QUESTION:  Did you have any sense at the time, either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , what the Christian response to all of this was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER:  Not yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Not yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">That part was, don't forget, out of my realm. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And there was, you know, there was not that kind of a contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">We lived in a narrow mentally, for us the world became very narrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">If mom had a sense of what the Christian world's reaction was, except for the immediate people that you dealt with, I don't know if she even knew yet at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">QUESTION:  You know, just for clarity, I wanted to date this time period. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">This was late spring of '42?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">ANSWER:  This was like very late spring, like toward the end of the school year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">QUESTION:  Of 1942?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="701">ANSWER:  '42, correct.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="704">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">By August of that year, we, Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Rausonk(ph) had come, actually in June yet, Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Rausonk(ph) had come into the picture and he immediately made arrangements. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">A, he gave mom a job in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">He made false documents for mom. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">He took me into this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my sister, one of them went to his brother's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the third one went to his secretary, and he started making arrangements to hide us in a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> of the Franciscan nuns in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Doel</span> , D-O-E-L. The Flemish part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">He had a cousin who also this past spring received posthumously, the medal and the title, Just of the Nations from in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">So, he made arrangements with her to hide us. </span><span class="sentence" id="713"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Doel</span> was a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="714">It was, it's a one street town, in fact, I've gone back there and I've only afterwards, realized how small it really was. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">One single <span class="DLF">street</span> and one <span class="DLF">cross street</span> , that was about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">It was a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> of Franciscans, nuns, it had been a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">But, there were no children now because of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And since it was right near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , sort of in the line of battle, there were no kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">There was also one <span class="BUILDING">outpost</span> , one <span class="BUILDING">German outpost</span> , one <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Rausonk(ph) took us there personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Well, first, as I said, I stayed in his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and...
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I want you to tell me about the trip there. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Like, how much did you and your sisters know at this point about where you were going and what, you know, what was happening and...
ANSWER:  You know, it was almost like a fog. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">We knew we had to be hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">We knew that somebody could take us away and kill us, although the word kill us was very vague. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">We knew that if we made the slightest mistake, if we disobeyed, 1f we made noise when we were supposed to be quiet, if we cried, we would not be taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And then all these bad things can happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And the words even bad things, was pretty, 1t was vague. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Because, you know, when you're a child, even the work kill or taken away and bad things can, it's something that frightens you, but you don't have that clear concept. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I had it and I didn't have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I knew I had to protect my sisters from all these bad things. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I had to make sure that they didn't betray themselves, that they didn't accidentally say their real name. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Or say that they weren't Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">But, 1t wasn't that, okay, the Gestapo will take me, they will take me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they will gas me, they will, you know, I didn't know, we just knew this global concept, we'll be taken away, we'll be killed, bad things will happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">But, nobody really knew yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">QUESTION:  Did you put up a fight at all about leaving your mother, or...
ANSWER:  No, it was, you know, this is something we talk about, my sisters and I, to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">The way, you know, because I look at my grandchildren, and my own children when they were raised, I mean, just to make, to get them to even eat or do homework sometimes, you know, is a little battle, when they want to watch TV and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And, I look at them, and I say, I have a grandson who, one is married, one's this 13, he will celebrate his Bar Mitzvah January 1, and I look at them, and I say, I can't believe how young they are in comparison to how old we were at that time, without knowing precisely. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">No, we did not, even the little one, even the little one, was so well behaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Although, I did have to pinch her a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">To get her to behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">She had a habit of biting and I had to constantly tell her, don't bite someone because they're going to send us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Don't scream, they're going to send us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Don't cry, they're going to send us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Don't ask for more food, they'll send us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">And we knew that we couldn't afford to be sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">That was very important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">QUESTION:  You had a lot of responsibility for an 11 year old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">ANSWER:  Yes, it's amazing I'm halfway normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Sometimes I think about it and I say to myself, you know, I miss, the one thing that I do miss is having had some frivolous light years. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I am younger today than I was then. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Because when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at 16, I was old. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And I look at 16 year olds and I say, they're such babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">They're such babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And I remembered I was handed a piece of paper to sign to vote for two people, which one do I like best? </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Frank Sinatra, Perry Como. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I didn't even know who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And when I learned what it was the kids wanted me to sign, I said, what kind of stupidity, don't they know any better? </span><span class="sentence" id="761">They were babies, I was isolated. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I was a very lonely teenager.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">QUESTION:  I want to get to that later, but I just, 1t must have been hard having responsibility for your sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">ANSWER:  It was! </span><span class="sentence" id="765">But, I didn't think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">I just knew this is what mom had told me to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And I have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And it was something that I had, was doing already, from the time that I was like seven and a half, eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Because from my earliest recollections, what I heard constantly was, don't be such a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Go take care of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Don't be such a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Or don't be a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">So, I, I was not a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">It was my mom and me and the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And that's the way it went. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And even as adults, 1t was mom and me and the kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">QUESTION:  Any thoughts about your father at this point? </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Or he was really in the background?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">ANSWER:  By now, we weren't really thinking about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I mean, at first there was, and there was anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">We didn't, there was really no reason to be angry, but, you see, we didn't know that he was going to jump <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="782">The aunt here had talked him into doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">He had no intention of not coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">As it turned out, there was, for him it was the best thing, but he had no intention. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">But he was talked into it and the attitude was, well, you come and we'll immediately take Fanny and the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">But, of course, by the time he realized that he couldn't get Fanny and the kids here, the war started and the rest is history. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">But, there was anger because I think we all have to lash out at somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So, whenever we did go, before we even went into hiding, when we were still together, I remember mamma getting upset many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And, where she'd lash out, sure, he's safe, but you know, and, you know, we had, especially when she had some real difficult times, so, you know, yeah, there was anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">My anger lasted even after the war when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">QUESTION:  We'll get to that...so, I think you were beginning to tell me how you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Doel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Doel</span> , right. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">We stayed no more than about two, two and a half months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="794">QUESTION:  How was the trip getting there, was that easy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="795">ANSWER:  Okay, the trip getting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Rausonk(ph) got a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flatbed truck</span> and, it's amazing because later on we went to <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> and we went openly by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but I guess he must have been really frightened at this point, it was probably his first experience even doing this, although he was with the Resistance, so I'm sure he was involved in many other actions. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">He got a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flatbed truck</span> , took some vegetable crates with, those wooden crates, fairly large, and put each of us under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">He then surrounded them and topped them with crates that were filled with vegetables and fruits. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And when he was stopped at a <span class="DLF">checkpoint</span> , well, because we had strict orders, not a sound, unless he stops the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> to let us go in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , take care of our physical needs or to give us some food and a drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">At a <span class="DLF">checkpoint</span> , he said especially when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> stops, not a sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And, I remember at one of the <span class="DLF">checkpoints</span> , we had stopped and I heard him ask for documents which was standard procedure. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">No matter <span class="NPIP">where</span> you went, at any <span class="NPIP">corner</span> , any <span class="NPIP">spot</span> , you can be asked for documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">So, that was nothing unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">He was asked for his documents and I know they were in order, and I remember hearing, what have you got there on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="806">He said, well, you can see, I've got vegetables, and I remember hearing like knocking on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crates</span> , but we didn't make a sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I always tell kids when I talk to them, the one thing I remember, and it's amazing the way you retain something. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I had a tickle in my throat. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And, I remember thinking that if I don't cough and clear my throat, that I was going to choke to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">But I also knew that if I cleared my throat and I made the slightest sound, Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Rausonk(ph) would be caught, then we would be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">So I held out. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I survived, apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I used to, when I taught, I used to make the kids do that in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And I'd say, you know, see if you can hold out a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">It's good exercise. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">But, anyway, that's how he drove us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Doel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And that's how he took us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> two and a half months later when the Mother Superior was afraid to keep us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">QUESTION:  So, describe your arrival at this <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , if you would.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="820">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">We got there, we were let into a <span class="BUILDING">parlor</span> and we were left in the <span class="BUILDING">parlor</span> with the nun and Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">Rausonk(ph) took leave of us and he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I had a feeling that he might have stayed to say goodbye to his cousin or something, but I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">But, he took leave of us and he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And we're sitting in this <span class="BUILDING">parlor</span> with the nun and all of a sudden Betty, the youngest, looks up at the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and she sees a cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And, which we had seen on <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> , but we had strict orders we were never to walk into a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">So, I knew really very little about Christianity. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I knew there was a cross and that there someone by the name of Jesus Christ on the cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Why, what, when, I knew absolutely nothing about. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And, I knew that Christian children went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> on Sundays and Jewish children went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on the Sabbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">But, I don't remember even thinking about the why's too much at that time because I associated mostly with the Jewish children, even though I knew some of the children in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , Christian children. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">So, she looks up and she says, what's that? </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And the nun looks kind of strangely at her and she says, of course, I'm Flemish, you know, why, that's our Lord on the cross, my little one. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Sure you know, and do you have that at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And she looks, and meanwhile, I started kicking, luckily there was a tablecloth, I started kicking her under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And she didn't make a move to listen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">So then I pinched her and she says, stop hurting me! </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And, I'm like, dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And I says, okay, we're lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">I didn't say it, I thought it. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And Charlotte was just sitting quietly. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Charlotte was very, very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">But, Betty was a rebel. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">That was the youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And, the nun says, well, I'm sure you have that at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And she says, no, we don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">She says, well, what do you have? </span><span class="sentence" id="848">She says, I don't know what you call it, if you give me a pencil and paper, I'll show you. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And she made the most beautiful Jewish star. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Well, I thought, that's it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">The nun jumps out of her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> , runs out of the <span class="BUILDING">parlor</span> , and, I mean, leaves the <span class="DLF">door</span> wide open, two minutes later we see two nuns coming, I found out later one was Sister Adonia(ph), the other one was the Mother Superior, arguing loudly, chaos broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And, I learned later, of course, in retrospect, I learned later from Sister Adonia(ph), I didn't learn this until after the war, from Sister Adonia(ph), that she was the only one that knew we were Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">She knew, but she told the Superior and Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Rausonk(ph) had, of course, I guess, instructed her to say something, that we were children of a prisoner of war whose mother had gotten ill, and who just needed a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay until our mother got well. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">But they were not told. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">She lied, actually, to her own Mother Superior. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Which, you know, for a nun, so, I was, until 1993, I was under the impression that the reason we were sent away was because Betty betrayed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">In 1993, I found out differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">This little nun here told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">She, in 1993, I visited with her, I said to her, I said, Sister Roberta, I said, it's a shame we couldn't stay with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">If only Betty hadn't betrayed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">She said, Betty had nothing to do with it, it was you. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">I said, me? </span><span class="sentence" id="864">What did I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="865">She says, it was you. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I said, so tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">So, she told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">It seemed that, see, there was no chaplain, usually convents have a chaplain. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">There was no chaplain because of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">The nuns went to the <span class="BUILDING">local church</span> and the priest, on Sunday when he was preaching, said something to the effect of, it's a shame what's happening to the Jews, but, after all, they're paying for the sins of their father, and so forth, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And I would come back to the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> 1n a rage, and just go on and on, why does he keep saying that? </span><span class="sentence" id="872">We didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">My mother didn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">We didn't kill anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">We didn't hurt anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And the Mother Superior was afraid that someday, in my anger, I would say this to the wrong person and, so, we were returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="877">QUESTION:  How long were you there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="878">ANSWER:  About two and a half months or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Between two and a half months and three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Even Sister Adonia(ph), after the war, wasn't sure if it was two and a half or three months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">QUESTION:  During this two and a half months, or three months...
ANSWER:  It was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">They were so good to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Sister Roberta and Sister Adonia(ph) took care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">They crocheted little slippers for us because we wore the wooden clogs, and what you would usually do is, you would walk into them with the little, like a little slipper and then when you get to the <span class="DLF">front door</span> , you just walk out into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="885">You didn't walk in with the shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">They, I remember her braiding my hair, I mean, they were just, really treated us wonderfully. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">There we were with all these nuns and, it was just nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="888">QUESTION:  Did they teach you any rudimentary Catholicism to just get you by?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">ANSWER:  Not much, well, we did learn who Jesus Christ was, and we learned what Mass was, and I also learned that I should have been, have had my communion and be able to go to communion, and I couldn't go because I wasn't baptized. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">So, I was told that if someone asked me, to say that my baptismal papers hadn't arrived, so they didn't feel they could let me go to communion. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="892">So, but not really much there, not much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="893">QUESTION:  Learned a few prayers...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="894">ANSWER:  Yeah, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">You know, just learned from the nuns, you know, Our Lord's Prayer, you know, but nothing really much at that point in time. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">By the end of the war, though, I knew catechism better than I knew Judaism, so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="897">QUESTION:  Were you, were there certain rules you had to adhere to in there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="898">ANSWER:  Not in that particular <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> as much. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">You know, we had to obey, we had to really be good, but we were just basically the three of us with all those nuns, so, it, that <span class="NPIP">place</span> was kind of nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Of course, we couldn't go where we wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">You know, we couldn't just walk out and go walking and things like that, or talk to any of the villagers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="902">QUESTION:  How did you spend your days?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">ANSWER:  I did some crocheting, some knitting, we talked to the nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">It's vague, it's pretty vague.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="905">QUESTION:  Do you remember ever having some sort of a contingency plan or a special <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> if there was visitors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="906">ANSWER:  Not in that particular <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Later on, yes, but not there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="908">QUESTION:  You never kept a diary during any of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">ANSWER:  What I did do, is I had written a few poems and a few things, some got lost, some had, I can't, there's one poem that I wrote in French and then I kind of polished it up, I don't have it with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">About, because what happened 1s, later on Charlotte was very, became enamored of catholicism and was talking in terms of she wanted to be baptized also, and I wrote this thing about my name being Jewish, and, one day I'll show you a copy. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">I should have maybe brought it, I didn't think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">It's somewhere is one of my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawers</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">QUESTION:  You don't remember it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">ANSWER:  Not, well, basically, the sequence was that, you know, we were being pursued and why, and because my name is Jew, it's synonymous, I am you and you are me, and see, there was a girl in one of the later convents, course this was later on, one who did become baptized, and became Jewish again. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">That's a story in itself, and I said, you know, when they betrayed you, I didn't do, Charlotte almost did, I didn't do, you remained me and I remained you. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">My name is Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">So, I still have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I, actually, I submitted it in a French class when I went back to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and it got an A, but that's not the issue.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="919">QUESTION:  Did you have any contact with your mother during this two month period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="920">ANSWER:  Not, no, not during that time at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">The next time that we saw mother is when Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Rausonk(ph) took us back the same way that we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">And, so we did spend some time with mom again. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And it was then that, apparently, Father Bruno came into the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Although, then I still did not know that he was in the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">We were hidden after that, we were hidden in a, an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Etherbig(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="927"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Etherbig(ph</span> ) is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="928">A borough of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And, it was with the Sisters of St. Joseph. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">What I didn't know until after I was there for awhile is that some of the nuns were not really nuns, they were young Jewish women dressed as nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Who were also being hidden there. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">We were there for, I'm not sure if it was seven or eight months. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">There was a leak, how the leak took place or what, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">All I know is that we, we did leave very suddenly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">QUESTION:  Can you describe your arrival at the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="936">What your impressions were...
ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">The <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , there we were very unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">It was, things were very strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">The food was not enough and it was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">There mom was able to come once in awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And she'd bring me some bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">The bread during the war was not really good, it was like, thick, heavy bread and the first day it almost tasted like clay. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Cause I don't know, as the war progressed, they used all kinds of things to make bread go further. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">The second day it got a little chewier, the third day it started having mold on it, but we ate it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And, we also, our bread there was also rationed in the, when I say rationed, we got a certain portion a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And what I would do is, I would hold the bread for my sisters and myself to make sure that, because the little ones would eat up their bread right away and then they would cry they were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And I wouldn't have anything to give them, so I held the bread and I gave them bits of it at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And there was a lot of stealing amongst the kids from each other of the bread and, I remember, like, at night, I would have the bread under my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> but I couldn't sleep because somebody would always come and try to steal your bread from under your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And I remember we also had terrible, we were packed with lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And Betty, the youngest, had these big sores on her head because the lice got under her skin and caused infections. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And, what I also had to do is, I was, I took the lice, as much as I could, and the little, they were like, I don't know if you call them nits or whatever, the little eggs that, they get stuck on, they get like stuck on the hair, and you have to actually, you can't just take them off, they, it's almost like they're cemented on, you have to literally hold the hair and pull them off. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And then we'd crack them. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">And I took them out of my sister's head, but I couldn't really take my own out. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">So, I would pay a bite of bread, I would measure it, my thumb, from here to here, one piece of bread, for every ten lice they took out of my hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">But, they had to show them to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Or ten, as I called them then, nits. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Like little eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">So, this is, there I worked, I had to help with peeling potatoes, I would steal some potato skins, you know, and I didn't know they had become a delicacy someplace, it was just, you know, sneak some away to eat, and I had to help with the younger kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">We bathed like in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tub</span> they would fill with water. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">But like, we would stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> and we'd each go in and wash and then step out and the next kid got into that same water. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And I had a problem, Charlotte was always very fussy, that's the middle one. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And I remember she didn't want to go in, and she got punished, so I forced her to go in because I didn't want her to get punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And then, there were rats there. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">So, this was a very, it wasn't a great <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="965">I did go back because there was one nun, an older nun, who was trying to be as good to us as she could. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">But, see, they had problems, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">They couldn't get enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">I mean, war brings all kinds of problems, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">QUESTION:  What about the other kids, I mean, did you make friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">ANSWER:  Okay, well, in that, see, there were mixed groups there. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">There were Christians and Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And it was an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , but it was also an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> for difficult children. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">So, there was a lot of punishing. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">I remember a lot of punishing, a lot of kids who didn't behave, it wasn't a very, <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> were being, overflowing all the time, you had all that, you know, smelly water and, I remember there was a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> in the center of it and when I went back to see if my memory, I, everything I remembered, I went back to confirm that my memory served me well, and it did serve me better than I even had ever dreamed it would. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Not that I want to remember all of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">There was a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , there was an apple tree in that <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And I remember seeing the apples and I used to die for one. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">So, we tried once in awhile to sneak in, but we had to climb a pretty big <span class="DLF">fence</span> and it had these pointed posts, it was like a regular <span class="DLF">metal fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And we couldn't really, comfortably get over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">One kid once got over and stole an apple and threw it over to us, but she couldn't get back over, so she was caught and we got punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">It was difficult, but we were safe, that was the important thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="982">QUESTION:  Now, were you distinguished as Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="983">Did anyone know you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="984">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">We were not distinguished. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">We were just all the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">Nobody said, you're Jewish, you're this. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">We were there, period. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">I mean, whatever went on, went on for all the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Not just for Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">Jewish or Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">I mean, we all, you know, suffered the same lot, so to speak.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="994">QUESTION:  But, the other kids didn't necessarily know you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="995">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">We had our false name, we were always, nobody told anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">As I said, I didn't even know that some nuns weren't really, weren't nuns, you know, until afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">QUESTION:  Did you have any fun there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1000">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">The only thing is, Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">Rausonk(ph) came to see us once, and Father Bruno came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">That was the first time I had met Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">But, I didn't know he was Father Bruno then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">He wanted to know if we were being taken care of, are we being taken care of, are we okay, and I remember saying, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">He said do you have enough to eat? </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I said, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I said yes to everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1010">QUESTION:  Anything else about this <span class="NPIP">place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Did you...
ANSWER:  There was a raid once, there were, I remember coming, it was shortly after that that we left, because I think there was a relationship between the, between that day and, there was something else, for the life of me, I can't recall it right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">I just can't recall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1013">QUESTION:  So, you really didn't, you didn't establish friendships, you took care of your sisters...
ANSWER:  Period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">As I say, we were with everybody, yet we were isolated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">If that makes any sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">We didn't share. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">You didn't confide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">You constantly were aware that you couldn't talk or tell anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">That was basically it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">You can't tell anybody who you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And make sure that your sisters never tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And that was another thing that kept me awake, is because I was always worried that maybe in their <span class="NPIP">dream</span> , if they woke up, they would accidentally give us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Well, with Betty I ran into some, I don't remember the exact time, but, I remember one time she said, I don't want to use this pretend name anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">Because we told her we were going to have a pretend name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">I don't want to use it, I want my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">I said, well, you got your name, you got Betty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">No, I want my whole name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">And she says, I don't want to pretend anymore, I don't want to play pretend any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">I says, well, if you don't play pretend, the boogie man's going to come and scratch your eyes out and tear your hair out and he's going to really hurt you, so you better keep playing pretend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">That was the only time that I recall that I ever had reprimand her for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">The other things I ran into is mostly because she would get into trouble with adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">Because if, she had a habit that if you got angry with her, remember I said she bit, she would bite, I guess it was her only defense, and she would always get punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">So, I tried to prevent her from biting, so I sort of kept constantly watching her to make sure she behaved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1035">QUESTION:  To your knowledge, were there any other Jewish children there with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1036">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">I learned later on that there were several. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">But, I don't know who they are.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1039">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you were...
ANSWER:  Unless I look at Father Bruno's list. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">You know, there were some names there, but...
QUESTION:  ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1041">ANSWER:  Yeah, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1042">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you were thinking about or dreaming about at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1043">ANSWER:  No, I just kept worrying about my sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">You see, you got to realize, I had a mandate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">When I left, when we left to go into hiding, here was the mandate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">My mother said, make sure the kids don't betray themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">She never said, make sure you don't betray yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Make sure the kids, which, of course, was inclusive, make sure the kids don't betray themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">Make sure they don't give themselves away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">Two, make sure they remember they're Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">Three, if the Gestapo gets me and I don't come back after the war, find your father in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and take the children to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">That was my mandate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">So, this is what I lived with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">In fact, I asked mom after the war, I said, you know, mamma, how could you put such a load on me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">I said, you know what it was like? </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">She says, Flora, did I have a choice? </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">She had no choice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1060">QUESTION:  Did you worry about your mother, or miss her when you were away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1061">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">Very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">I was very attached to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">As a matter of fact, it was not until she died that I realized how much our psyche's were intertwined. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Because we lived through so much, in a way, together, even though we were separated at times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">That it was, let me put it this way, if that makes any sense, I felt responsible for my mother's happiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">My mother ended up being the only survivor of her entire generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Of the, I'm talking family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">She, 1t was very difficult for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">She had a, an , which nobody else knew except me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">What she went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">And, to her, to the day she died, I felt a tremendous responsibility of making her happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And in those days, making her happy, was to be good, to do what she asked, to make sure the children were okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1074">QUESTION:  So, when it was time to leave the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1075">ANSWER:  I came back to the secret <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that we had and, by then, my uncle and my aunt were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1076">QUESTION:  Actually, I just want to try to get a sense of the day...
ANSWER:  Okay, by the time we left there, was, it was either late July or early August, '43, by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">We went back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And, as I said, by then my mother's younger sister, her husband and the little one were already staying in our clandestine <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">By then, my mother had started sleeping in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">Rausonk's(ph) <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">Actually, he was with the Resistance, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">During the day they had to work for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">They make like little micro parts for, I don't know if it was for arms or what, but there was something that they produced, some kind of industrial object that the Germans needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">But, at night, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , they worked for the Resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">They made, you know, secret arms and all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">He was, besides hiding us, he had a couple of families that were hidden in attics of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that he owned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">One of the families was hidden upstairs in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that housed, it was like across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , that housed a <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span> where his workers had their lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">And the people, during the day, could not make a sound because the workers downstairs, you know, came and ate at different hours and there were snacks during their breaks or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">But then at night, once the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was closed, they had the run of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the whole <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">So, he had a few families that he hid besides us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">Which is something I didn't know until after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">So, we stayed with my uncle there in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and then, Father Bruno made the arrangements for us to be hidden in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Werselater(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="1095"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Werselater(ph</span> ) was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tielt(ph</span> ), which was not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bruesch(ph</span> ), which was like on the other side of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">Totally opposite side of where we had been til now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">Because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Etebekke(ph</span> ) was right outside, was really part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , Etebekke(ph), <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Doel</span> was north, but it was near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> , this was closer going towards <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , the <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> , whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1098">QUESTION:  Now, did you meet Father Bruno at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1099">ANSWER:  At that point, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">At that point, the only time I had seen him was at, at , of course, I didn't know that it was Father Bruno until later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">I really became close to Father Bruno after the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">That's when I really felt a relationship with Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">So, we were supposed to, the way we went to the last <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , and that was also, and my mother, again, begged my aunt to let the little one go, and she just couldn't bring herself to do it and by this time, the little one was already two years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">So, go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1105">QUESTION:  I'm sorry to interrupt you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1106">ANSWER:  No, that's okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1107">QUESTION:  At this point, did you know much about what was going on with the war and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1108">ANSWER:  At this point I knew, because at this point already, people jumped <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and people who escaped, somehow managed to come back and tell and, it was like, there was like, an unofficial, there was a grapevine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">There was a grapevine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">People picked up and, the Resistance was a big conduit of that information, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Because there were Jews involved, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">There were a lot of Jews who were with the Resistance in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">There was, in fact, there was a group called the Commite(ph) Defance(ph) De(ph) Schwif(ph), the Committee for the Defense of the Jews, which was a Jewish group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">As a matter of fact, I met one, the head of that group, Mrs. Strassberg(ph), just this spring in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And they worked with the Resistance and with the group with Father Bruno and an attorney Vandenberg(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">As a matter of fact, Vandenberg(ph) was a Christian who died in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">He was arrested, not for hiding Jews, but for hiding people who hid because they didn't want to go for forced labor, because, you know, Christians also were taken for forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">It wasn't just Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">So, he did die in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">You know, there were like a lot of, as I said, I just translated a book, I'm just about putting the polishing touches on it, on this network and these people who were helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">It was an incredible operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">So, but at that time, I wasn't aware of who was totally involved, except that the name, Father Bruno came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And not only that, until 1993, I didn't even know the name of the person who took us to the last <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">Because here's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">We were supposed to go to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and meet a woman dressed in a certain manner, no name given, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">We were just supposed to kind of make eye contact with the woman and so, actually, mom did and her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">Although, and we had to stand apart from, our mom stood in one <span class="NPIP">spot</span> , we stood in another <span class="NPIP">spot</span> , the woman stood in another <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">Although, we saw each other, and our instructions were that, when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulled in and this particular woman went into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , that we were to follow her, sit down where she sat down, but not to address her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">But, you know, when I think about it, as I'm saying, it's amazing that we were able to carry all this out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">We did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">We did exactly as we were told. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">At that time, and when I think back, one of the hardest things that I personally ever did, and I talked to my sisters, and for them, too, was not to say goodbye to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">Not to hug her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">You know, you go off on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , still, we were still kids, by then, when we left the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> it was early September, '43, by then, I was 13, Charlotte was 10 and Betty was seven. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">So, we, and also, I said, rumors had started coming back because one of the people that had jumped a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , as a matter of fact, was a friend of mom's, who was one of the refugees in 1938 who had stayed in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">Because there was a Mr. and Mrs. Gross(ph) who had stayed with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And Mr. Gross(ph) had jumped a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And found mom, because he knew her, because, you know, through the grapevine, you kind of let each other know where you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And, he had given information. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">Then, there was another person who had jumped a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and had come, that we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">And, there was no, not only was there no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , but also being the Gestapo was, I guess, must have been searching for him, mom hid him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">See, she had these false papers, so she was able to move around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">She hid him in a <span class="BUILDING">bombed out building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Gave him blankets, whatever we had and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">And she took food to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And then one day, he wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">Because he, he was pretty badly wounded, he could barely, he had great difficulty walking at that point, because from the jumping, that, I don't know what happened to him to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1149">QUESTION:  We're almost out of tape, so...
ANSWER:  ...just sum up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1150">QUESTION:  Well, no, I think, let's stop the tape so you can start on a new tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">End of tape two. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">Tape three
ANSWER:  No matter what the circumstances are, there's a natural way of parting from a parent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">You give them a hug, you kiss them, you say goodbye, you look back at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">We weren't allowed to do any of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">We just literally had to ignore her and pretend that she was a stranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And I remember it being very, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">It went totally against my being because we were a touching family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">We always hugged, we touched and here we couldn't even, not only not touch her, we couldn't even look at her and say goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Or even from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , wave goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">And we didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">We didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">We went into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we followed the lady who, as I said, in 1993 I learned her name, it was Mrs. Vandervagen(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And she was a Christian woman, poor woman, who did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And the only thing she asked for in return was reimbursement for a little lunch that she bought. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">Unfortunately, I didn't find her alive, so I could thank her personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">She, when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped, which I know now to be Werselater(ph), we followed her out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and, not until we were quite a bit of a distance from the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , did she stop, turn around, sort of spread her arms out around us, say, I'm taking you to a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And she took us to the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> of Werselater(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">Werselater(ph) was a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , it also had an <span class="DLF">orchard</span> , it had a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">During the war, however, in addition to the regular <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , they added one of the wings of the, they took one of the wings of the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> rather, and turned it into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fresh Air camp</span> for poor children, children whose fathers were prisoners of war, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And every three months a new group of children came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">They left, they never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">They had no visitors during the three months that they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">In the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , the children had visitors every weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">They went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for holidays, they came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Even the physical facilities were very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">In the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">children's dormitory</span> was divided up into little <span class="INT_SPACE">cubbyholes</span> , each child had sort of an <span class="INT_SPACE">alcove</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">nightstand</span> , small <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> for their clothing, and a curtain so they could have a little privacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">Their <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> had small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> , tablecloth, flowers, and it was a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with large <span class="DLF">windows</span> and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Being the other set-up was a temporary set-up, the <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> was a large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and metal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , one next to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">Just divided by a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">nightstand</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">And in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> were long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> , set up where children sat one next to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">There was, to me, that was a very important distinction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">In addition to that, in the colony, as it was called, there was one teacher for all the grades, and she did, basically what she did was babysit and not really teach much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">She disciplined. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">She was not a nun, she was a secular teacher who had been brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">And the older children helped with darning socks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">I learned how to do beautiful darning work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">I can still darn nicely to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And, we helped kind of watch the little ones and all that and being I was one of the older ones, by then I was 1n charge, in addition to being in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I wanted to go to the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> and I remember asking the Mother Superior, why can't I go to the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">And she said, for security reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">She said, here there are no visitors, no one is asking questions as to why I don't go to communion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">The children leave, they never come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">In the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> she felt that, at some point, somebody would ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">So, she says, unless, if you had been baptized, she says, I could let you go to the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">That was the only, if you could call it mention, of my, perhaps, becoming baptized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Otherwise, outside of that, never was there any pressure or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">The other girl that was there, there were two girls, actually, we were five, to the best of my knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">One of them did not stay too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">She did an awful lot of crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">She, one day, just vanished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">And my assumption was, that, because she couldn't control her emotions, they couldn't afford to keep her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">Because the one thing, and not only from my own experiences, but from speaking to other children who have been hidden, you had to be, quote, a good child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">And when I say good, as I said, you had to be able to obey, you had to be able to be quiet when you were told to be quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">You had to not cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">In other words, you had to almost be invisible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">To be kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">So, and the other girl that was there, eventually, was baptized and went to, the one was sent away, the other one was baptized and went to the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">As a matter of fact, I did meet her again here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">She's Jewish today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">She felt that there was pressure put on her to be baptized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">My experience, having been in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> , was that there was no pressure put on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Never did anyone, any of the nuns, say to me, you have to be baptized, I heard them say, or you'll go to <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">We did learn catechism, we had to everything the other children did, short of going to communion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">We went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , prayed and studied catechism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">That, she did teach us, that teacher.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1219">QUESTION:  Did the other children know you were...
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Nobody knew we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">The, as a matter of fact, when, at the end, they were packing to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they said, so I guess, we're all going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">I said, yes, we're all going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">Except, that they went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">Eventually, we were there for 13 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">When <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> was liberated, we stayed awhile, back, later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">In April of 1944, my, one day, mom, I'm going to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">But, of course, this I don't know from personal experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I only know this through mom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">Mom, as I said, was sleeping the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and taking food to my aunt and uncle that he had brought into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">She came one evening with the food and there was a Gestapo seal on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">Now, what is a Gestapo seal? </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">Whenever the Gestapo would empty a <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> of the inhabitants and take them away to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , they would seal the <span class="DLF">door</span> with a seal, a Gestapo seal, which was easily removable, we're not talking about anything that, 1t was a sort of a cardboard, paper kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">Like a sticker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">Which meant no trespassing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">A few days later they would come back with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and empty the contents of the <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">From us, they didn't get that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">Because, don't forget, this was already late, you know, when we ran and everything, so, basically, the few things that we assembled weren't of any great value. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">But in many <span class="BUILDING">residences</span> , they did get great value. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">They'd come back and they'd empty the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">And it was called mublakseum(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">And what they did is they took the possessions back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or whatever, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And, as I said, I know people are still claiming artwork that they took. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">She came, there was a Gestapo seal, she knew immediately what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">But, she was, she had enough sofwau(ph), as they say, I don't know, how do you say, I mean, she was cool enough, calm enough, because she was, she had an incredible strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">Opened the seal, went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , took the albums out, she had this obsession, the albums. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And it was after that that the albums went to a Christian family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And she took a cover for herself, so she could be a little warmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">And that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">And took off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">I mean, if they had caught her, I don't even think they would have taken her to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , they would have probably killed her immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">I get a letter, now here's the thing, when we were hidden, and this held true for other children, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">We were receiving mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">Not by official post, but by couriers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">And I would, I got mail, it wasn't a weekly thing or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">But, I did get mail from mom and I was able to respond. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">Mother Superior calls me into her <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , I didn't know that my aunt and uncle were taken, and the baby, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">Mother Superior calls me into her <span class="BUILDING">office</span> one day, and says to me, Flora, read this letter from mamma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">And I read the letter and she says, what's your mother saying? </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">I said, I think my mother is saying that my aunt and uncle and Nunu(ph), we used to call my cousin that, were taken by the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">She says, exactly what I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">Cause see, my aunt, my mother wrote in code. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">She said, dearest Flora, your aunt and uncle and your little cousin went away on vacation to visit the rest of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">I don't know when they'll be back and I don't, something to the effect, I don't know what to do in the meantime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">So, she, the Mother Superior picked up on that and I immediately knew what it meant, because nobody went on vacation, you know, if you were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">You know, but then, see, by that point in the war, I already knew, there were enough rumors coming back, that we kind of knew what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">We didn't know about <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , we just knew people were being deported and somewhere they were being killed, they vanished, that's what we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">She told me to send my mom a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">Dear mamma, why don't you come visit us while Aunt Leah(ph) and Uncle Alex(ph) are on vacation? </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">And my mother came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">She, by then, even with false papers, it was getting dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">So, what she did is, she walked the <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> at night, slept under <span class="ENV_FEATURES">bushes</span> during the day, and when she ran out of food that she had, she took from the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">It's a very fertile <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , there are always things growing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">And, she came, by this, by that time already, of course, 1t was May of '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">And she stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">We couldn't, Mother Superior gave her a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , under the <span class="DLF">staircase</span> , I'll never forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">She helped out in the <span class="DLF">orchard</span> , by her own free will because she didn't want to eat for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">And, once a week, we were allowed to see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">Outside of that once a week when the Mother Superior would come and take us for a half hour visit, we were not allowed to see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">If we did see her somewheres in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> or in one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallways</span> , we had to pretend we didn't know her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">It was not that easy, the other girl knew it was my mother, but, the day of her birthday, her birthday was, this was at the end of June, her birthday was in June, June 29th to be precise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">We were allowed to see her on her birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">And the Mother Superior, the first cherries had just been coming out, they were very early, but these were very early cherries, unless she got them somewhere else that I don't know about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">There was a box of cherries, a metal box of cherries that she gave mom for her birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And then there was an envelope with some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">And I remember mom protesting about the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">And she said, this might have been past her birthday, this was on one of the visits to her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , with the Mother Superior. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">It could have even been later, because I distinctly remember it being cherries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">Because mom loved cherries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">And she, mom said, you're hiding me, you're hiding my children, you're feeding me, why are you giving me money?

<p><span class="sentence" id="1334">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">Alright, well, discipline was strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">That time was starting to be lengthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">There started to be this feeling, when will this be over? </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">It was starting to be lengthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">But, it was, almost had adjusted to this way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">I had a small personal problem, because the other girl who was baptized, was transferred to the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">And, I'll never forget, I met her once in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">So, of course, we didn't really interact that much any more, I met her once in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">And she kneeled down and crossed herself in front of a statue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">I said, Renee(ph), you don't have to do that now, there's nobody here to see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">You know, we had never said, I'm Jewish, you're Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">We just knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">It was amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">Not with everybody, we just knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">And she says, she threatened she was going to tell the Mother Superior. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">But the Mother Superior knew that I had, that I could not accept, I did ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">And I was tempted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">There was something very beautiful about the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> , the mass. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">And, I started feeling very secure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">So, there was a temptation of becoming Christian, but it was, but there was always my mother's words behind me, you know, don't forget, make sure the children remain Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">Don't forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">So, that held true for me, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">But, we did have one problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">I mean, it wasn't one problem, there were several. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">Once in awhile, there were checks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">The <span class="DLF">door</span> would ring, men in uniform, they came looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">They came looking for political dissidents, they came looking for German soldiers who had gone AWOL, which, at that point of the war, there was a lot of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">A lot of German soldiers were leaving their units. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">And, they were also looking for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">And, I remember one specific incident, it was several times where we sort of had to run and hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">But, one specific one I remember, because I remember being very, very frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">The doorbell rang, there were sort of, there was a sort of plan, that was set into motion immediately, as soon as someone in uniform would come to the <span class="DLF">front door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">There was a chain of command, so speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">Anyway, we knew exactly where to go, a nun came with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">And we ran into, remember I told you it was a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and they had potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">Of course, they had to share it with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">They were raised, you know, quotas that they had to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">We ran down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> and the nun and the three of us ran behind a big pile of potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">I mean, I talk, you know, a big pile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">So, we ran behind it, we sat down and we stayed put, quietly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">All of a sudden, the <span class="DLF">door</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> , I didn't see it, I heard it, open up, I hear footsteps coming down, several people, and I remember hearing in German, ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">Rouse(ph)! </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">Rouse(ph)! ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">Rouse(ph)! </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">And we're sitting there, I remember shaking, I remember getting so cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">And I held my little, the little one, and the nun kind of had her arm around Charlotte. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">And, we were sitting there, not moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">And then we, every once in awhile the command would, we knew they were there because we hadn't heard the <span class="DLF">door</span> close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">And it would be quiet for a minute, and then, we heard potatoes rolling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">So, I felt like, somebody was disturbing the potato pile behind which we were sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">We heard potatoes rolling and I hear someone say, , or something to that effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">And then they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">And we just stayed put for awhile yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">We didn't dare come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">And then, after a certain amount of time, we finally did come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">We were safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1391">QUESTION:  Did you have any contact with the local population in that <span class="REGION">area</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1392">ANSWER:  There was, not exactly contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">My sister, Charlotte, somehow befriended one of the kids that was coming to the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , there was also, see the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , 1t was a large <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">Like a hundred and twenty nuns or something at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">Now, they've, they've dwindled down to a very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">There were, the nuns also ran the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">And, I say the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , I mean the <span class="BUILDING">village school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">So, you had the children that came for the three months, you had the <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , which were like the wealthy kids, and then you had the regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">The kids that came every day and then went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">Charlotte, somehow, had met one of the little girls and became friendly with one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">And I remember being very nervous about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">And once or twice, she would go to that <span class="BUILDING">child's house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">And when the nuns learned about it, they stopped it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">It was the custer(ph), the custer 1s, you know, like the man that takes care of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , not, who kind of keeps it clean and orderly and all that, I don't know the word in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">But, outside of that, we didn't really have any contact with the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">I did, occasionally, sneak out of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">And, I snuck out because I just needed, even though there was a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , and I was able to get fresh air <span class="NPIP">within</span> , once in awhile, I just felt like I needed to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">And, I remember, I snuck out, and I'd go into the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">And the wheat was growing high, and I would just go in and kind of sit down by myself and just, just sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">Literally, just sit and look up at the <span class="DLF">sky</span> for little periods of time, and then sneak back into the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">And it was forbidden, I wasn't allowed, for obvious reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">The other thing I did one day, they had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , where every, where a nun died, or someone, she would be laid out in that little, like a little, tiny thing, two by four, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">They, until burial time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">And, I remember, being very curious as to what happened to her in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and I one day I snuck in there and I kind of felt her toes, and she didn't move [laughter]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">I mean, little things like that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">And, that's where, also, I, well, never mind, this isn't important. ,</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1417">QUESTION:  So, you and your mother returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> ...
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1418">QUESTION:  You came back to retrieve your sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">What was, and this is October, '44, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1420">ANSWER:  '44, late October, '44.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1421">QUESTION:  What was going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">What was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1423">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">Things were still chaotic in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">You had British troops, you had American troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">People, at that point, there were no refugees coming back, yet, but you still had to keep running down into <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> because, as I said, the V2's were flying over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">See, the war didn't end til '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">So, there was a lot of, there was bombings, there was shootings, there were all kinds of things still happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">Food was hard to come by, but the Jewish organization was already setting into place, and was the joint, as you say, Jewish immigrant, Hebrew immigrant society. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">And they started to help Jews who were returning either from <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> and then later on, of course, those who were coming back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">And, we also, one day mom was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> and a British soldier walked over to her, I guess there must have been something about her, and he said to her, Yiddish? </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">And she says, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">And, so he was like so excited that he saw a live Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">Came and brought her some food and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">Eventually, and then, of course, Father Bruno, mom, now, I don't know how Father Bruno knew where we were living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">I think, probably, through the Mother Superior, somehow the contact was made, mamma, Father Bruno came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">You know, there are questions that, even though mom and I talked a lot, there are some questions that somehow never came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">Because I, myself, didn't talk about this until about 1980. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">I did go back to visit and everything, but I didn't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">I did not consider myself a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">Because I had not been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">So, I deferred to, to me, survivors were those who survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">And, not until 1980, when in, it was either '80 or '81, I was teaching at <span class="BUILDING">Einstein High School</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kensington</span> , and a Social Studies teacher and I were in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and he pulled out a pamphlet, something from his mailbox, and, as we were walking down the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> , my eye fell on that pamphlet, and I say, let me take a look at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">It was one of the first pamphlets that I had seen by, we call them the ; revisionists, Alfred Butz(ph), out of Northwestern, when he had written a book, the hundred and twenty questions about the Holocaust that have never been answered, the Hoax of the Twentieth Century. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">Well, there was this anger that came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">And, I say, sure, it never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">So, where 1s everybody? </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">And that same day, I put a note in every teacher's mailbox in my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , identifying myself as a survivor for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">And saying I'd be glad to come talk to their students. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">And then later on, one of the teachers to whose <span class="BUILDING">class</span> I had spoken to, and who had done, then, a little unit on the Holocaust, had a swastika painted on her <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">So, she and I and a Social Studies teacher from Richard Montgomery, got together and decided, because they were both Social Studies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">I taught foreign language, I taught French and some German at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">So, their frustration was that, at that time, there was nothing on the Holocaust that you could use to teach in the textbooks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">There were maybe two <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">So, they were frustrated and I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">So, the three of us got together and we created a course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">We've been teaching for 11 years, the teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">We do teacher training. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">So, that came out of this anger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">So, that's when, for the first time, I identified myself as a survivor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1461">QUESTION:  Let's just go back to right after the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1462">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">Father Bruno came to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">I had to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">Mom and me had to try to find some work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">I had to go to work, I found some work, we again did some sewing in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , with mamma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">Also, I found a job filling boxes with soap powder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">And, being the youngest, had to scrub the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and I worked, I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">Then mom felt that, if I could work with my hands, I could earn my bread anywheres in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">So, she, there was a dressmaker in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> we lived in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">So, she asked her to take me on as an apprentice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">She did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">And then I went and took some evening courses, learning how to make patterns, clothing patterns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">To design them, cut and all that. , </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">waste paper to make them this big, you can't do anything with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">But, anyway, it was around that time that Father Bruno came to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">And he was also honored, I went to a Hannuka(ph) party where he was honored. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">Just before he left, because he eventually went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">He worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in the red light district, with prostitutes, to bring them back to the faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">But, anyway, he came to visit, he brought food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">The Mother Superior gave me food to take back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">Because, remember I told you, they were a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">And Father Bruno, at that time, when he visited, said to me, so, what are you doing, Little Flora? </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">And I told him that I'm working, learning with the dressmaker and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">He said, wouldn't you rather go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">I said, yeah, but I have to help mamma feed the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">So, he said, I'll talk to mamma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">So, I hear them arguing in the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was so tiny, you couldn't help hearing one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">And, I hear mamma saying, look, Father Bruno, you've saved their lives, that's enough, I'm taking over now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">I'll handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">We'll be fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">But, he did convince her, and he enrolled me in a <span class="BUILDING">catholic school</span> on the , In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">I went back there this spring, as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">But, I didn't know at the time, but I just learned now, is that his sister, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> belongs to the same order where his sister is a nun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">And she's still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">I saw her this spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">I visited her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">I visited Father Bruno's brother, he has two siblings that are still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">And, he sent me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">I learned how to type. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">Then I finally took, after I finished the pattern course, I went at night and learned how to do bookkeeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">I was always trying to juggle and learn and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">But, anyway, not only did I learn how to type, that was extracurricular, he had one of the nuns give me piano lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">I didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , because he knew I loved music, but I didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , so the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was on one side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , it's still there, but it's a different, they do something different, it's not exactly the same type of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">Then, it was a regular, you know, you know, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">The <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">And, in the morning before classes, they would leave the <span class="DLF">convent door</span> open and the <span class="DLF">parlor door</span> open, and I would go in and practice on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">Then I would go across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and go to <span class="BUILDING">classes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">And then, of course, after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , immediately after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , there was typing and drawing lessons, which were extracurricular. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">And I loved it, just absolutely loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">There was a slight problem, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">Because, you see, we came from the Flemish part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I had been at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Etervig(ph</span> ), but I didn't exactly learn how to read and write in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">I learned how to speak French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">And I didn't speak French until, learn French until we came, after we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">So, that was another thing we dealt with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">Then we went back, Werselater(ph) was in the Flemish part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">So, then, by the time I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , most of the French was gone again, except for speaking a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">So, I really had to learn how to read and write French. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">So, at first, I just sat in <span class="BUILDING">class</span> and then, slowly, anyway, to make a long story short, he did visit a couple of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">And then, of course, he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">And then I didn't see him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">But I corresponded with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">And, I did visit him a few times before he left <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">I visited him a few times where he lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">He was sort of like a surrogate father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">There was something, how can I explain, very, very special about the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">He had these twinkling eyes and, you know something, everybody who knew or met Father Bruno, people who had been hidden by him and everything, tell me, when I say he had these twinkly eyes, they say, that was exactly it, that was Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">I mean, it just, there was something about his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">It was like goodness itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">And I always asked him, you know, Father Bruno, you took such, you see, Father Bruno was betrayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">Father Bruno had to get out of his habit and wear civilian clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">And yet, he continued doing what he was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">He his over 300 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">And, he and Father Andre(ph), another priest, they stole virgin identity cards, and they stole municipal stamps and filled them in with the children's false names. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">And then he had to go and get ration stamps with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">And he had a collaborator there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">I mean, it was amazing the things he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">So, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there and, eventually, I dropped out of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because mamma felt that the schooling wouldn't really do much for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">That I really needed to learn a trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">So, I became, I really learned how to be a dressmaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">And, then through a soldier, we, who helped us, he, a British soldier, he helped find my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">And one day, it was Christmas morning, I didn't know it at the time, of course, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">The doorbell rang and I, mamma said, run open the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and I went to open the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and there was an American soldier at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">And he said, Mendelowitz(ph)? </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">I say, yes, oul. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">And he says, Merry Christmas! </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">I didn't know what that meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">I knew Noel at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">So, and he hands me a box. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">And he leaves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">There was a letter taped to the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">And, I'm standing there and all of a sudden I'm starting to yell out, mamma, mamma! </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">There was soldier here and he gave me a box. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">And I run up with the box, because we lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , and, nobody even looked at the letter, we opened the box. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">A box. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">It was filled with food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">Spam and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">At that point, we ate everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">Today I don't eat pork, but then, as long as we had food, who cared what we ate? </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">And, then when we were full, we ended up being sick for several days, we overate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">But that was another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">And, we read the letter and it was a letter from the <span class="BUILDING">American Headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> asking mom to come by on a certain day, that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">Her husband was an American veteran and, eventually, the Army brought us to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">In 1946.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1566">QUESTION:  When you were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , after the war, were there other Jewish people who had come back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1567">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">People were coming back, started coming back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> after '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">And, I cannot describe to you, what some of them looked like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">It, most of them didn't, couldn't talk about, you know, you'd ask, say, well, what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">They couldn't even tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">And, you waited, mamma waited for my aunt to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">And my uncle, and the baby and other members of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">And, they never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">And there were many who waited and they didn't come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">Basically, it became a waiting game. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">So, you know, simultaneously, while all this was going on that I was telling you about, at that same time what you did is, you waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">And if some people came, came and they needed a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay, you had, at one point, we had several people, again, living with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">We had several young girls who had managed to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">And, in fact, a couple of them did tell mamma some things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">And I asked mamma, because I'd overheard a work here and there, but not everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">She'd say, not for you, Sweetheart, you're too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">You're too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">And, it was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">And many, there was one person I'm still looking for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">He was a little boy who we're indirectly related to through marriage, who was born in '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">And, after liberation his family, his parents, his 17 year old brother, all of them were taken and they didn't come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">And, the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> that he was in, because mom knew where he was, allowed us to take him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , like for the weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">So, I would bring him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I remember him being full of sores and mamma got nauseous when she had to take care of him, so she made me take care of the sores. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">I took care of his sores. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">Then when we were trying to leave for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , we were trying to take him with us because his family, there was nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">But, the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> wouldn't release him to us because we weren't his, mamma wasn't his parent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">So, mamma got in touch with the Jewish community and then left him in their hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">What happened was, in 1980, '83, there was a gathering in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and I met a woman and I told her the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">So, she says, you know, there was a group of young children that were given to an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish orphanage</span> , after liberation, and then, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> , a whole group of kids were adopted sight unseen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">Maybe he was amongst them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">Sends me a photograph, I'll recognize him on the photograph. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">I haven't found him yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">See, I don't think he remembers his name or who he really was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1601">QUESTION:  How long after you were liberated, did you, did it take you to observe the Jewish religion again? </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">Was there any ambivalence about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1603">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">Mom, as soon as, picked right up again, tried to find candles, and we lit them, anything that she could find. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">There was a piece of metal, so it shouldn't burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">But, at the same time, simultaneously, declared there is no God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">And God does not exist, because if he had existed, he wouldn't do what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">Because she was also trying to find out about the rest of the family and all then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">Of course, nobody came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">She died a religious woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">Her faith came back to her, later, much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">But, she always immediately started observing the rituals and always did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">So, she lived a very Jewish life while claiming and asking, where is God? </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">So, I think there was that ambivalence within her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">But, as I said, towards later years, her belief in God returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1616">QUESTION:  Anything else you can tell me about Father Bruno or how, or your sense of how much of an organization there was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1617">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">I did not even know how much of an organization there was until 1991. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">Of the extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">I didn't know until 1991 that there was anyone in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , outside of my two sisters, myself and these two people of which the one girl was in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , were saved by Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">It was in 1991, after a gathering of hidden children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , that I learned of others in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> who were saved by Father Bruno and I learned that there was a book out that was assembled on Father Bruno and that Father Bruno's nephew, Michelle(ph) Rainers(ph), who helped him through the war, lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> , <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">So, through all this I was in the dark, but I wrote to Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">In 1948 I received my last New Year's card from Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">As a matter of fact, it's in the book that I received it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">I just translated anonymously because they couldn't make out who had written this letter to Father Bruno and I'm reading it, when I started translating, but I said, My God, that's my letter! </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">And after that, I lost track of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">In 1966, I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and I searched for Father Bruno. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">I had forgotten the address in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> that his family lived at, but I have been there since. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">But, I remembered the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that he had taken, where I had visited him, and he wasn't there, nobody knew about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">I knew his <span class="BUILDING">Abbey</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leufair(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">I went to Leufair(ph) and I was told they didn't know where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">But that part, of course, now I know where he was, they didn't tell me where. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">And I was sort of lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">And, how, you can't, you can only, my time was limited in Europe, I had to come back and go back to my job, and I never found him again, to my, so, I was not able to see him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">And especially in his later years, I would have loved to have been able to go see him because he died, unfortunately, a very sad death, he had Parkinson's.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1636">QUESTION:  At the time, you didn't have a sense that there were, that there was a network of people trying to hide children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1637">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">I did not know that at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1639">QUESTION:  Now, this Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">Rausonk(ph)...
ANSWER:  Now, Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">Rausonk(ph) I remained very close contact with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">We saw him when I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1643">QUESTION:  What, what motivated him? </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">How did...
ANSWER:  Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">Rausonk(ph), let me tell you something, I asked the same question of every person who was responsible in our rescue, and of anyone, I, who did any rescue work, even when at the premier of Shindler's List, I had the opportunity to speak to Mrs. Shindler because what happened is, I was sitting with her and talking and a lady walked over and said, will you still talk to me after the film? </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">And, I, Mrs. Shindler looked, I said, she didn't understand a word she was saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">So, I said to her, if you tell me, I said to Mrs. Shindler, sprekensie(ph) kine(ph) English? </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">She said, neutsche(ph), spreke noi(ph) Deutsche and Spanish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">So, I don't really, I mean, I can survive in Spanish, but I don't really speak it, but in German I can manage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">So, I said to the lady, I said, who, if you'll tell me who you are, I'll be glad to interpret for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">So, she says, I'm the actress who's playing Mrs. Shindler in the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">That was before, there was a reception before the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">And, so I interpreted and then I turned to Mrs. Shindler after she had left, I said, you know, Frau Shindler, tell me, if you, because, you know, they minimize her role, and it was much larger than the people know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">If you had to do today, if you were young today, and you had to do what you did, could you, would you, do it again? </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">She, I remember, she went like this, what else is there to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">If one person can't help another, what's life all about? </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">Just like that, very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">I wanted to see what someone else said, because the answers I got were also simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">Sister Adonia(ph), I remember, I asked her, and she said, Flora, what do you mean, why I did it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">For the love of God, they're innocent children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">Period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">No great heroism there, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">Mother Superior, what else was one supposed to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">Father Bruno, he said, Flora, why do you keep asking that question? </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">I only did what I should do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">Rausonk(ph), you read the card. </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">He thanked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">Instead of we thanked him, he couldn't understand why we're thanking him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">We thanked him, and when, he wrote me this card in 1967, after we had given him a gift of a watch from all three of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">And, I receive a card from him saying, I'm overwhelmed with all this gratefulness you're showing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">It is for me to thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">And he goes on and on and on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">And then I called him from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I said, Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">Rausonk(ph), what kind of nonsense are you writing me in your card? </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">What is this business of you should thank us, you saved our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">He says, but you don't understand, Flora, you gave me a chance to find out what I was made of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">That's how simple it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">For them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">It wasn't simple, but these are people who couldn't see another direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">There was no hesitation, this 1s what was, there was a need, they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1682">QUESTION:  Yeah, I mean, he, on one hand you have people who were very pious, here you have this rich industrialist who actually shepherded you to your <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">He could have paid people to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1684">ANSWER:  No, he did it himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1685">QUESTION:  He took the risks himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1686">ANSWER:  And yet, from a Catholic point of view, he wasn't the most moral of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">He had a mistress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">In fact, after the war, he was, he and his wife are both devout Catholics, and, you don't have to tape this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1689">QUESTION:  The tape 1s rolling and I don't want to...
ANSWER:  Anyway, they were devout Catholics and so they never got divorced. </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">But, when he was older and ill, he went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and his wife cared for him until he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1691">That had nothing to do, you know, with...
QUESTION:  In all these experiences, did you ever have a sense that people were either frightened to or resistant to helping you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1692">ANSWER:  In my personal experience, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">With the exception of Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">Rausonk(ph)'s wife, and now, who feared for herself and her children, there was an incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1695">I don't know if I mentioned it already on the tape or not, whereby I was in Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="1696">Rausonk(ph)'s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I was put to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and I heard Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">Rausonk(ph) and Madame Rausonk(ph) arguing in the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">And I heard her saying, , you want to risk your life? </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">You can do whatever you want, but you don't have the right to risk my life and my children's lives for a couple of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1700">And I remember jumping out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and running into the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and saying, Msr. </span><span class="sentence" id="1701">Rausonk(ph), please I don't want you and Mrs. Rausonk(ph), and I was sobbing, to fight over me, please take me back to my mother, please take me back to my mother, I don't want you to fight with Mrs. Rausonk(ph) for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1702">And he pointed his finger at me, and went, you, get back to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="1703">This is none of your business! </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">The voice was so powerful, so authoritarian, I mean, I just ran, jumped back into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , put the covers over me and just laid there shaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1705">And never said another word. </span><span class="sentence" id="1706">But, that was the only time that I actually heard in words, someone say, and, you know, I'm a mother and I'm a grandmother, and I pray, and I always said to myself, God forbid, if there were ever a need, if someone knocked on my <span class="DLF">door</span> and said, I'm being pursued, help me, that I would have the courage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">I would like to believe that I would have the courage to help, but I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">Until that moment of truth, so to speak, I don't think any of us really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1709">But, had there been more of that, you would have had more people living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">Because, also, when people protested as a mass, the Nazi's backed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">They were only able to carry through, I firmly believe what they did, is because people did not protest enough.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1716">ANSWER:  1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">May 29th, we docked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I'll never forget it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1718">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">I want you to tell me a little bit about your impressions upon arrival, who was there to meet you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">Also, it must have been fairly powerful, or maybe even strange, to see your father again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1721">ANSWER:  It was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">We hadn't seen him for eight and a half years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1723">QUESTION:  So, why don't you tell me about your trip to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , your arrival here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1724">ANSWER:  Okay, when we arrived, we were met by two men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">At the Port of New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">One was very tall, and one was, looked extremely small to me, much smaller than I had vaguely remembered, from what I had remembered, the little one was my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">And I kept looking at him and saying, that's my father, that's my father, but I didn't feel that that was my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">There wasn't any elation, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">We were all so, don't forget, we were all so very tired from the journey. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">And we, there wasn't a lull where there was sort of a period of time where we relaxed, were happy, all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">Because there was a struggle and all that because we also had to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ovra(ph</span> ), and things weren't that comfortable either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">We got stuck in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and there was a problem with me, I couldn't go onto my mother's passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">And the Army was also, there was a question as to where could I be brought as a dependant, because I was past 14, somehow, at that time, for some reason, 14 was the cut-off date. </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">So, it was always, well, we'll let her go this far, and if they'll let her, pass her, fine, and it was all the way into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , that it was, okay, she can go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , I don't know if they'll let her off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">But, anyway, I looked at him and it was very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">We then came out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was very dirty at that time, around the <span class="DLF">port</span> was a lot of garbage and everything, I remember, we didn't think we liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">He hugged each one of us, but I don't remember feeling the sense of family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">And then, I remember being angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">I was angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">Because I felt that, well, I had sort of absorbed my mother's anger, I think, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">Then we came, we were a large, see, dad had nothing when we got here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">Because he was so sure that his wife and children were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">That he didn't really prepare. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">I guess he had formed sort of, I guess you can call that a depression or something, but, like, well, who should I really work for, kind of thing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">So, we moved into a <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor apartment</span> , no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> , one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> on the whole way for four <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">And, we had hot water, but our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bathtub</span> was our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kitchen counter</span> with a cover. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">Take the cover off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">But, anyway, we settled in and, the children, the two children took to my dad pretty quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">Because they were still young and they were sent to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">And I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">I went to work in a <span class="BUILDING">sweatshop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">They called it a <span class="BUILDING">sweatshop</span> , it was actually, you know, they make the blazers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">And at night, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> called the Eron(ph) School. </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">For business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1756">I think it still exists, on <span class="DLF">14th Street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1757">And, I took English stenography. </span><span class="sentence" id="1758">I didn't really know English, but I took English stenography. </span><span class="sentence" id="1759">Because I figured, I knew by then French stenography, because that's another thing I had studied, I knew how to type. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">I knew some bookkeeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">So I took English stenography. </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">And I tried to kind of adjust into life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">Mom went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">She went and presented herself as a furrier, they fired her two days later, she was no furrier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1765">Because she heard you could earn good money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1766">She learned something, she then got a job somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1767">She got fired a week later, she learned something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">Within six months, mom was a furrier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">She then learned she can join the union, and you can earn more money that way, so she went, they said, yes, but you gotta picket a certain amount of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">Guess who got elected to picket? </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">Me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1772">I picketed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1773">She joined the union. </span><span class="sentence" id="1774">She started earning good money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1775">And, we children were very unhappy living where we were living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">Even with the war and everything else, there was just, also, we had to learn English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">It was, they were difficult times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1778">And, she says, kids, don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1779">Because I wanted to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1780">I wanted, at that point, I wanted to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1781">And, she says, don't worry, I'll have you out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1782">You'll be out of here within two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1783">Within two years, mom had learned enough English to learn that, and dad, of course, they both worked and they were trying to save a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1784">And learned that if you're a veteran, you can buy a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> without a down payment, within two years we were established in a <span class="BUILDING">townhouse</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">That was mamma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">Of course, with papa's help, but she was really the big push.</span></p>

QUESTION:  So, you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , you moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span> ...
ANSWER:  We moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Queens</span> ...
QUESTION:  I guess my question here is, even though you are now free, you're in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you're, you've been able to, I guess, re-establish yourself, I'm sure there were a lot of adjustments you all had to go through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1806">ANSWER:  Well, there were, there's no question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">We came, we didn't really know the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1808">I had the privilege of having had five English lessons before we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1809">Because we needed one person who could ask a few questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1810">So, we, I had five English lessons, so I was elected to ask the questions, where is this and where 1s that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1811">So, that was the extent of my knowledge of English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1812">When we, we settled in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , as I said, within a week, mom was out looking for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1813">And, so was I. We both got jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1814">Mom and I then talked and she says, you know what, it would be a good idea if you could learn again, maybe finish up learning how to make patterns and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1815">So, I found out, with my five words of English, that there is a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> called the High School for Fashion Industries, or something to that effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1816">I believe around <span class="DLF">23rd Street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1817">I make my way there and I enroll myself in this <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1818">And, as far, when it came to the dressmaking and those parts, I knew everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1819">However, in the other classes, it was another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1820">I didn't know the language, and I remember sitting 1n a class, and one day I was asked a question, and I couldn't, I tried to answer it and, of course, I had this deep accent, and my English, of course, was very poor, and I remember everybody laughing and I got very upset that one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1821">And I just bust out crying and ran out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1822">The teacher came after me and, you know, brought me back into <span class="BUILDING">class</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1823">And then, time went on, I did very, I got several <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> credits from the things that I did know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1824">And then the principal called me in to her <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and she said that I could get a scholarship to the Fashion Institute of New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">I didn't know what a scholarship was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1826">I thought it had something to do with being a scholar, but I didn't feel like a scholar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1827">But, I didn't know what a scholar, I didn't know that a scholarship was, as I said in French, , which was money to attend a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1828">And, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I told my mother and father that the principal said I could get a scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">My father knew what a scholarship was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1830">But, he says, I'm a girl and a girl doesn't need that much education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1831">Then they discussed it, of course, with uncle and the uncle who sent his two daughters to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , didn't think that I needed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1832">And, I was then pulled out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1833">Period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">But I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">Eron(ph) School</span> and took some more bookkeeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1835">That I could do at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1836">Then, I decided once I knew stenography, I would get a job and I applied for a job with an attorney. </span><span class="sentence" id="1837">Because I then learned that in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , it isn't very elegant to work 1n a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , that you have to work in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , to be, quote, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1838">So, I applied to this attorney, I know stenography in French, I know stenography in English and I know how to type and I know bookkeeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1839">And he dictates his first letter and I type up the letter, I was there for three days by then, and I wrote the word subpoena, S-A-B-E-N-A. That's the only subpoena I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1840">Whatever, that's the end of that job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1841">I then got another job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1842">And another job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1843">After awhile, my English improved because what happened is, I, as I said, I found teenagers very frivolous here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1844">So, I wasn't comfortable with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1845">Adults really didn't want any part of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1846">I wasn't considered an adult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">So, I isolated myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">I worked and then in my free time, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and with a dictionary and books that I had asked the librarian to tell me what I should read, I taught myself English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1849">I didn't know a verb from and adjective for, or a topic sentence or anything like that, but I taught myself how to read English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1850">And I literally photographed linguistic structure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1851">Not realizing that it would come in handy later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1852">And, eventually, I presented myself to M. Lowenstein(ph) & Sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1853">I believe the company still exists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1854">As a bilingual secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1855">And, when I was asked if I had a high school diploma, I said, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1856">And, I got the job, and I realized that I really didn't know a lot, so what I did is, nobody else in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> knew French, so I told my boss, I need a dictionary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1857">He brought me a dictionary and I took the work <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1858">I pretended to do it in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , I took the work <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I worked at night, brought the work back, and learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1859">I ended up staying there until after I was married and I didn't leave until I was expecting my son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1860">I became a good bilingual secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1861">Of course, I felt bad I had lied by then, you know, but you had, the thing is, I did my work, I worked very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1862">Then after that, I just kept, basically, I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1863">I mean, literally, that was my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1864">My <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my family and work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1865">Then for awhile there, my second child, my husband was promoted and I could be a homemaker for awhile, so I was a homemaker, but I wanted certain things, like music lessons with the best of teachers and everything that was good for my children, so I started using my dressmaking skills because I didn't want to leave the children because I didn't have parents at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I felt that my children should have a mother at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1866">But I wanted money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1867">So, I became a dressmaker again at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1868">And when the children were in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I worked as a dressmaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1869">Meanwhile, I became active in the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1870">We lived outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> and there was no <span class="BUILDING">library</span> in my children's elementary school, so I volunteered to set one up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1871">I set up a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1872">My husband had a decent job, but, I wanted more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1873">And I told him to leave his job and go and try out for another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1874">And his father said, no, you have a job, you stay put, you don't go chasing after birds in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1875">And I said there's only one way, I said, we're young, we can do it, well anyway, time went on and we made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1876">And then, but meanwhile, I never had a high school diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1877">When my son was, there were two incidents that drove me to improve myself in other <span class="NPIP">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1878">One of them was, I still had a fairly deep accent and I didn't realize to what degree because my husband never said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1879">Once in awhile people would kind of make fun, but by that time, it didn't bother me that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">One day my little one came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from first grade crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">And I thought somebody had beaten him up, and he said, please, mommy, when you come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , don't talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1882">Everybody says you talk funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="1883">So, my child wasn't going to be an outsider, so I started working with my husband and improving my accent, that's why I have a New York accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">And fighting my accent, that was one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1885">Then one day, I realized that someday the children are going to ask me if I have, if mamma has a high school diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1886">And I didn't want to have to lie to my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1887">So, I went to see my, but, you know, there was one element in all this, is that I, basically, I was very much of a loner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1888">I did things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1889">Like, I, as I said, I became part of the community, I worked at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as a volunteer at the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , I, at the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> I volunteered, I became a den mother and all that, but, yet, I was a loner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1890">I had no time for friendships. </span><span class="sentence" id="1891">But, I think it wasn't so much that I had no time, I think I had become so comfortable going my own way, going all the way back when the children laughed at me after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I isolated myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1892">I worked and started teaching myself English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1893">That it became a pattern. </span><span class="sentence" id="1894">In fact, I'm still accused of being a workaholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1895">I'm supposed to be retired, but I work all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1896">And I think you develop a pattern. </span><span class="sentence" id="1897">But, anyway, I went to see my little girl's kindergarten teacher and I said, look, this is between us, I want to tell you something, maybe you can help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1898">See, because I had talked to my husband, my husband kept saying, Flora, you're a smart girl, you don't have to prove anything to anybody, you don't need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1899">But, I wanted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1900">So, she says, you can get a high school diploma two ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1901">She says, I know they are giving some exams at <span class="BUILDING">Temple University</span> to veterans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1902">You can get what they call a General Education Diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1903">Or, she says, you can take classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1904">She says, but, you know what, why don't you take the test, if you fail it, you'll take classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1905">So, I went and I took the exam and, it was, after that, it was a series of exams. </span><span class="sentence" id="1906">And I took them and then I was supposed to come back to find out the results and, I get a diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="1907">And I'll never forget, the man who handed it to me says, well, Mrs. Singer, what are you going to do with this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1908">What am I going to do with this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1909">Who's going to be my equal? </span><span class="sentence" id="1910">I've got a high school diploma! </span><span class="sentence" id="1911">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1912">So, by then my husband was more successful, we were able to live in our own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> already, you know, things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1913">So, that, that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1914">We went out to dinner, he was so proud of me and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1915">Anyway, time goes by.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1916">QUESTION:  You have how many children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1917">ANSWER:  I have two children and four grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="1918">Time went by. </span><span class="sentence" id="1919">We, eventually, my husband went into his own business and when my son was in his first year of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , it was either the last year of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> or the first year of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1920">One day we were talking about courses and credits and things like that and he says, you know, mom, he says, how come you never went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1921">He says, you're always pushing education. </span><span class="sentence" id="1922">How come you never went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1923">I said, me, at my age? </span><span class="sentence" id="1924">I'm old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1925">I was only 39. </span><span class="sentence" id="1926">I don't even know if I was quite 39 at that point, but I felt old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1927">I said, I'm old, I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1928">Sure, he says, schooling, everybody's gotta go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you gotta, learning never stops except for you, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1929">Well, I didn't sleep all night, the next day I presented myself at <span class="BUILDING">American U</span> , because by then we lived here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1930">And, I said I need to speak to someone who could advise me on <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1931">And I kind of give a little background and the counselor says, well, I'll tell you what, I'll give you a stack of books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1932">Take them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , read them, come back, we'll discuss them and I'll tell you if you're college material. </span><span class="sentence" id="1933">I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1934">Came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1935">Meanwhile, I had built, helped my husband build a business, we had a <span class="BUILDING">bagel bakery</span> and all that, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1936">And, I read the books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1937">I had read every one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1938">Those were the books I had read during my hours in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1939">But I re-read them to make sure that I knew what I was talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1940">I came back, we talked, no question, you can make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1941">I said, well, how would I go about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1942">She says, well, you can come in as a special student, if you do C or better, you can matriculate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1943">So, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I told my husband, I want to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1944">And he says, Flora, why are you always trying to prove things? </span><span class="sentence" id="1945">And I said, no, I just, I want to do this, I said, I want to give an example to the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1946">So, but financially, it was more convenient for me to go to <span class="BUILDING">Montgomery College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1947">So, I enrolled in <span class="BUILDING">Montgomery College</span> and I finished up there and then there was a scholarship for women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1948">It was right after that that Horizons for Women came out, remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="1949">Started going back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1950">But, I had started it just a little before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1951">To make a long story short, they had a scholarship to <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> that was offered to women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1952">And I was one of the candidates. </span><span class="sentence" id="1953">But, then it was based on need and, fortunately, by then, I didn't have a need. </span><span class="sentence" id="1954">So, another woman got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1955">A minority woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1956">So, I went to Maryland anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1957">And I finished up my degree, finished Magna Cum Laude, believe it, I still can't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1958">And, now, again, I get a surprise party. </span><span class="sentence" id="1959">My professors are invited and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1960">And at that point, I added my maiden name again as a middle name, because I felt that my father would have wanted that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1961">Because there's no one else to carry his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1962">But, that was the end of it, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1963">Again...
QUESTION:  So, do you think your husband was right, that you had this compelling need to prove yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1964">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1965">It's a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1966">Because what happened, what's interesting, my husband is the one who changed, not me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1967">What happened was, after the surprise party, I didn't know, but he had gotten some tickets to take me on a vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1968">And, being I had been so busy between helping him and going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and studying, and all, and taking care of the children still, even though they were adolescents now, he kept complaining. </span><span class="sentence" id="1969">See, the thing is, he kept complaining throughout the years that I was going to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , we couldn't go out because I had to study for tests or write a paper or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1970">But, anyway, this was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1971">I'm in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I had gone out shopping to get a few clothes for my vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1972">And I get a phone call and it was Jack, and he says, my husband, he says, Flora, are you standing or sitting down? </span><span class="sentence" id="1973">I says, why, who died, who got hurt? </span><span class="sentence" id="1974">Anyone got hurt? </span><span class="sentence" id="1975">Anyone sick? </span><span class="sentence" id="1976">He says, why does it always have to be bad news? </span><span class="sentence" id="1977">He says, no, sit down if you're standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1978">And, so I sat down, he says, how would you like to go to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> and teach at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Maryland</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1979">I said, what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1980">He says, yes, they waived the GRE's and you can go to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> , not only aren't you going to have to pay, they're going to pay you, and you'll teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="1981">I said, well, I can't do that to you, I said, you know, it's not fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1982">He says, how can you refuse it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1983">Meanwhile, that same week what had happened is, a friend of mine had bought out a, actually, no, she hadn't bought it out yet, she had gotten a job as a guide, a tour guide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1984">And they offered me a job also, because of my linguistic skills. </span><span class="sentence" id="1985">And I had accepted it, but I hadn't gone down yet to get fingerprinted for the license and all that, and I said, and not only that, I said, I already promised to take this job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1986">He says, Flora, how can you compare the two? </span><span class="sentence" id="1987">How can you, you can't turn it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1988">I says, but, Jack, do you know what that means? </span><span class="sentence" id="1989">That means again, homework, and papers and all that, I says, I won't be able to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1990">He said, so what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1991">So, anyway, I went back to graduate school, I taught at Maryland three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1992">And then they offered me a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1993">And, I took it and then my husband talked me out of it because he felt it was just such a big trip to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1994">And, I sent a vitae to the <span class="BUILDING">local colleges</span> , but then, a friend of my husband who works in the <span class="REGION">county</span> , they needed a French teacher at <span class="BUILDING">Einstein High School</span> , called, said they had an opening, would I take it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1995">I said, me teach <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1996">My husband says, look I know you, come September you're going to be unhappy if you don't do anything, he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="1997">So, I took the job and a few days after I had, after I had signed the contract, I got an offer, there was a position at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Georgetown</span> , part-time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1998">But, of course, I had signed the contract. </span><span class="sentence" id="1999">And I loved working with the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="2000">It was like, literally, a fish going into <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2001">I just loved working with the kids, and I stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2002">Stayed with Britannia and ended up retiring from Walt Whitman High School. </span><span class="sentence" id="2003">And some nice things happened to me, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="2004">I ended up going back to <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> as what they call a master learner, there was a special program. </span><span class="sentence" id="2005">And I just went to a wedding of one of my former students. </span><span class="sentence" id="2006">From <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2007">I ended up going to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> on their program that I was selected for on a grant because of something I had written, comparative study of Shakespeare and French literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="2008">So, some real nice things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="2009">Did they just happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="2010">Did I need to prove? </span><span class="sentence" id="2011">I don't know if I needed to prove myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="2012">I don't remember thinking, ever, that I needed to prove myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="2013">There isn't, I don't remember there being an ego. </span><span class="sentence" id="2014">There is ego now, because I say, yeah, I really did all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2015">But, I don't remember thinking about needing to prove. </span><span class="sentence" id="2016">It was always for the children, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2017">QUESTION:  Maybe tried to make up for the fact that your education was interrupted in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2018">ANSWER:  Perhaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="2019">It was basically, the feeling of, I've got to give an example, how can I let my children, in other words, mamma had to be an example for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="2020">And it started with mamma not having her <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> diploma.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2021">QUESTION:  Let me ask you a couple of other questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="2022">If you don't mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2023">ANSWER:  Do you guys have <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> here to sleep in? </span><span class="sentence" id="2024">Because I'm afraid at the rate she's going...[laughter].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2025">QUESTION:  You expressed that you had to really grow up very, very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="2026">That when you were age 11, you were, I think you said, that you felt older then than you do now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2027">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2028">QUESTION:  Were you ever resentful of that, or...
ANSWER:  Well, there are moments where I would, I miss being light hearted. </span><span class="sentence" id="2029">I have never really even today, I've never been able to be totally light hearted. </span><span class="sentence" id="2030">Because even today, I feel I've got to justify my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="2031">Being alive, let's put it this way, and I do a lot of work relating to Holocaust work, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2032">I, as I said, I teach the course. </span><span class="sentence" id="2033">I do a lot of public speaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="2034">I'm on the, I speak, a member of the Speaker's Bureau at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2035">I sit as president, co-president now, because we're getting older so we decided, we recycle each other because we're not that many, of the survivor's group, and these are responsibilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="2036">I feel, I don't really stop and really think about it, but I think I must feel a sense of meriting, earning my life, the fact that I'm alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="2037">And I think sometimes of, I'll give you a parallel of someone most kids are familiar with. </span><span class="sentence" id="2038">Kids read Anne Frank. </span><span class="sentence" id="2039">Now, Anne Frank would have been a year older than I am today, had she lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="2040">Anne Frank was hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="2041">Not even three hours from where I was hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="2042">And yet, I was given the chance to have this beautiful productive life. </span><span class="sentence" id="2043">I have children that I'm proud of. </span><span class="sentence" id="2044">I have grandchildren that I adore and find a lot of joy in. </span><span class="sentence" id="2045">I have a wonderful man that I'm married to. </span><span class="sentence" id="2046">So, I do have a feeling that I do have to earn that, perhaps, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="2047">That, if I'm alive, I can't waste that life, if that makes any sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2048">QUESTION:  What, are there other long term effects that you can cite in terms of how these early experiences impacted on your later life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2049">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2050">Let me give you, let me tell you, yeah, I know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="2051">I don't know if that's what you're looking for, but let me tell you, where I do have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2052">I, on my passport, is always renewed at least a year before it expires. </span><span class="sentence" id="2053">I will not risk getting stuck. </span><span class="sentence" id="2054">And I have a little cash, enough to buy a train ticket somewheres. </span><span class="sentence" id="2055">I have urged my children to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2056">I've urged my husband to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2057">My husband's, I renew for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2058">But, which is stupid, because he's an American you know, and I'm an American today, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="2059">My citizenship is my most precious possession. </span><span class="sentence" id="2060">Because, you know, I don't agree with everything the government says, but I bless this <span class="REGION">land</span> every time I come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="2061">That is an obsession and I have not been able to convince my children because they feel so comfortable and so free, that they can't, as I say, they think I'm still obsessed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2062">Maybe it is a foolish obsession, I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2063">QUESTION:  So, you still don't feel entirely safe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2064">ANSWER:  No, I never feel entirely safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="2065">I don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="2066">I really don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="2067">In fact, my neighbors tell me that I have the most locked up <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> , why I'm always locking. </span><span class="sentence" id="2068">I didn't many, many years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="2069">I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="2070">There's one thing that never has gone away. </span><span class="sentence" id="2071">If I am stopped by a policeman, even though I know, I've worked with policeman community relations, the department, you know, come to my classes, and I've dealt with them and they're wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2072">But, there is still, in an official capacity, if I am stopped by a policeman, my whole insides shake. </span><span class="sentence" id="2073">Literally, shake. </span><span class="sentence" id="2074">There's just something, I got stopped, I didn't get a ticket, but I got stopped by a policeman once, and his voice was a little louder than it should have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="2075">And I could not come up with a voiced answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="2076">I finally did, but I was shaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="2077">So, there are these things, alright? </span><span class="sentence" id="2078">If I see a pair of boots, I still get affected. </span><span class="sentence" id="2079">We had an incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="2080">This goes back at least, oh, God, at least maybe 18 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="2081">So, I don't know exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="2082">My husband and I had a free day and we had gone into, it was one of these perfect days. </span><span class="sentence" id="2083">We had gone into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , we visited a couple of the <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> , we ate at the <span class="BUILDING">National Art Gallery</span> , the little <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> they have there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2084">And it was one of these perfect days, but whenever I had a perfect day like that, it frightens me, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="2085">Kind of, nothing can be that perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="2086">But anyway, we're driving back on <span class="DLF">16th Street</span> , and all of a sudden, my body started to shake. </span><span class="sentence" id="2087">My husband must have noticed it, he was driving, pulls the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> over, he said, what's the matter? </span><span class="sentence" id="2088">I could not talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="2089">I was literally, my teeth were chattering. </span><span class="sentence" id="2090">And I couldn't even tell him what's wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="2091">Finally, I calmed down, there were several men on K and <span class="DLF">16th Street</span> , with a swastika on their arm handing out leaflets. </span><span class="sentence" id="2092">Now, I know I'm safe, I'm in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , there's something that that triggered in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2093">Or sometimes, I'll forget myself and I'll listen to a lecture. </span><span class="sentence" id="2094">I'm fine as long as I'm on guard and I know exactly what's happening, but I can't be caught by surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="2095">And, as a matter of fact, I was at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and I do very well, you know, I'm strong and I, I was at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> at a lecture, and a friend, one of my neighbors introduced one of the speakers and he happened to be a, he's a psychiatrist, he came up and I was shaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="2096">And I said, you know, Richard, I don't understand this. </span><span class="sentence" id="2097">My mind 1s calm, I know where I am, I know exactly what I'm dealing with, I said, why is my body reacting? </span><span class="sentence" id="2098">He says, because the mind may not forget, but the mind can repress, but the body remembers. </span><span class="sentence" id="2099">He says, there is physical remembrance, which I was not aware of. </span><span class="sentence" id="2100">Not being a psychiatrist, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2101">QUESTION:  I'm sure there must be, I mean, in light of what you're talking about, there must be certain sounds, certain smells, certain sights that trigger...
ANSWER:  It does. </span><span class="sentence" id="2102">Well, I do fear whenever you have, like when Farakan(ph) spoke . </span><span class="sentence" id="2103">I knew I was safe and all that, but such fear that someone who could mobilize people can take another people, perhaps, and mobilize this mass against others. </span><span class="sentence" id="2104">And that's a fear that's never gone away. </span><span class="sentence" id="2105">Because even with Hitler, there are many things, even I sometimes tend to want to say, yeah, I'd like a little more order. </span><span class="sentence" id="2106">I'd like less violence. </span><span class="sentence" id="2107">Let's, you know, , and then I say, no, we can't, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2108">Because there's always seemingly something good in an authoritarian kind of a setting. </span><span class="sentence" id="2109">But...
QUESTION:  One other question, there's only a couple of minutes left on this tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="2110">We can always put in another one, but, I'm sure . </span><span class="sentence" id="2111">Just sort of your thoughts on the Catholic religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="2112">I mean, here you, basically learned it, it harbored you, and yet you are an observant Jew today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2113">ANSWER:  But, I respect those who believe in Catholicism or any other religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="2114">And, as I say to youngsters, when I speak to them, I say, had I been born a Catholic, I would've been proud to be a Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="2115">Had I been born a Hindu, I would have been proud to be a Hindu. </span><span class="sentence" id="2116">Because each religion does teach some good things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2117">It's the way we twist those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2118">And...
QUESTION:  But you must have some feeling about Catholicism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2119">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="2120">Let me, I used to question, there are some things I can't accept because I have been so strongly Jewish before I ever went into the <span class="BUILDING">convents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2121">So, even though there was this attraction, the Mother Superior has said I have promised to come back and become a nun, and I'm still sometimes accused of, for a nice Jewish girl, being a, I could easily be a nun. </span><span class="sentence" id="2122">Not, why I don't know, that's another, you know, thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2123">But, I did question the Mother Superior a lot and one day, I'll never forget this, she said to me, she says, Flora, faith is beyond us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2124">It's above our heads, let's just pray to God to be able to believe, she says, but don't worry about it, she says, there's one God in <span class="NPIP">Heaven</span> and different <span class="DLF">ladders</span> to reach him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2125">And each religion is one of those <span class="DLF">ladders</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2126">Now, this coming from a nun. </span><span class="sentence" id="2127">Father Bruno, when he gave a child into hiding, said, this child is not to be converted. </span><span class="sentence" id="2128">That doesn't mean that some overzealous people didn't try, but he said, this child is not to be converted. </span><span class="sentence" id="2129">Our job is to save their lives, we don't, you know, their soul doesn't belong to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2130">A true Christian, to me, is the one who practices religion, who does what you're supposed to do, but...
QUESTION:  When you were in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , did you say Jewish prayers to yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2131">ANSWER:  I did try to think if the quietly. </span><span class="sentence" id="2132">But I didn't dare tell the little kids, my sisters, to do it, because I was afraid they would do it loudly. </span><span class="sentence" id="2133">But, after awhile I really didn't, but once in awhile I would sort of think the in my heart, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="2134">Just remind myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2135">QUESTION:  We have, I think, probably less than one minute on this tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="2136">Is there anything else you want to quickly say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2137">ANSWER:  If my tape will, this story will help people to reduce prejudice and if we could just learn to respect one another, 1n spite of all of our difference, I'll feel like I've accomplished something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2138">QUESTION:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2139">ANSWER:  You're welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="2140">Conclusion of interview. </span>
