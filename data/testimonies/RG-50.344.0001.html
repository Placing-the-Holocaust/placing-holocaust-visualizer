QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">And when did you decide to become a nurse and why”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  I decided to become a nurse when I think I was about eight years old and I had been bitten by a dog in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">He had jumped and caught my ear. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">We were jumping rope on a <span class="DLF">porch</span> and he was lying sleeping and I guess the boards may have pinched his skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">And he jumped up and caught my ear. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which was a few <span class="DLF">doors</span> away, crying, with my ear hanging and my dad took me to the <span class="BUILDING">doctors office</span> -- in those days that’s what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And the doctor sewed it back on and his nurse was so darling to me and I was so impressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">She had a crisp white cap and a sparkling white uniform and I was just impressed with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I remember that my -- I was crying and my dad said oh, he’s getting all wet, my tears were rolling down his back. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And she was just such a remarkable person and that -- I thought after that, “I’d like to become a nurse, too.” </span><span class="sentence" id="11">That was really the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I always fell -- and I used to play with my animals and with my dolls and always took care of them and wrapped July 14, 1995 them up, bandaged them. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">It was just -- and my mother couldn’t tolerate the sight of blood, so -- it was my dad who was the one who really took over all the time, but that was really what -- I can still see the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , I can see the doctor and the nurse and that was -- that impressed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So that -- as I grew older -- I was also interested in maybe becoming a kindergarten teacher, but because I wasn’t able to really play the piano the way they requested, I -- I decided well, nursing is the thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  And when -- what year was it when you went into <span class="BUILDING">nursing school</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And at that time then, the war was -- <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> wasn’t yet in the war in Europe, but I’m -- what was your consciousness about what was happening there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Well, in ‘41, when we heard the announcement that Pearl Harbor was struck, then- | knew then that I wanted to be in the army and my roommate wanted to be in the navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I was just very anxious to serve my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the army if the war was still going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And of course, that’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">As soon as I graduated in ‘43, applied to join the army and I was accepted and from there on, it was just -- I was very excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">It was a wonderful experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">It’s something that I cannot tell you all the experiences we had and what we learned and what we saw and did. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And we were very young, as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">It was a remarkable experience, one I shall never forget, treasure every minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">July 14, 1995
QUESTION:  Why the army for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  I don’t -- I wanted to be a hospital nurse and at that time they were -- the army nurses were on the hospital shifts. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And that’s what I thought, I’d like to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And -- but then once -- and I also wanted to go overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">That was -- when we had our basic training I knew I wanted to finish with all of this and I wanted to go overseas and work with the [indecipherable] right there -- right where everything was happening.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  I think it was in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I really don’t have that in -- yes, because I think our class was class number 10 and I think we graduated from basic training in September in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlantic City</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  When did you start basic training, was it before or after the invasion -- the D-Day invasion? </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Do you remember?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  I wanted to serve my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and do what I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">They were giving their all and dying for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , so -- and I felt that was my responsibility, I felt that calling, the same way I felt the calling to become a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And I think it is a special thing and there are only certain people who -- who do these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I always felt I wanted to help people and do things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  What was your family’s response to your wanting to go and serve?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Well, my parents weren’t happy about my entering training, because in those days nurses were just considered people who handled <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bedpans</span> and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">That was true in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">That’s what they thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And I pleaded with my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And I needed 100 dollars to give in order to get into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , into the program. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And finally I convinced them and they did send the check in and I was accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But -- and as far as going overseas, my brother was in the service, but they knew then and they were the proudest parents to have a -- a nurse in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And they knew that if I wanted it, that was fine.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="216">ANSWER:  Yes, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We were aware, but had no idea that it was going to be as quickly as it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And when they told us and then we left, from there we were -- from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> we were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , but we didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And through all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> we saw all the white sheets and flags of surrender, out of all these little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">It was very interesting, I had never seen anything like that before and they were all waving and very cheerful and happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Everything was quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And that’s when we went on into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I think we arrived there -- I think it was May eighth or ninth. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I’m not sure when.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  Do you remember where you were when you heard about the German surrender?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  Well, I think we were still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">We had heard about President Roosevelt dying earlier in May, when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in that valley. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And then we heard that the war was over and we were jubilant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Did you have a -- did you have a party, did you -- July 14, 1995
ANSWER:  We all celebrated in our own way, I guess -- several of us did -- had a big party with all kinds of things, we were drinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Just didn’t seem to matter, 1t was just a jubilant feeling to know that all of this has now ceased and that hopefully we could get our boys back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I was looking forward to going to the <span class="REGION">South Pacific</span> , but that didn’t happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And we knew that we probably would be discharged after we returned back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">We didn’t know how soon that would be, because we had another chore to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And that was when we arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And that was when we drove in in the two and a half ton <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and we were just overwhelmed at what we could see from where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And -- and the odor was something you’ll never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Once you have that in your nostrils, you’!l never forget that. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And I know our colonel did say that it was up to us, either we -- we didn’t have to serve this duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And I thought that was strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And of course we all said yes we would and we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  Hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">ANSWER:  And we were there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  Were you told what it was going to be? </span><span class="sentence" id="245">What you would do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  Well then, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They were -- they did tell us and of course we -- we were still -- we had no idea what we were going to see when we did go in the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And we had to wear our fatigues with our leggings on and our sleeves tight and we all had olive drab turbans that we put on our heads so none of our hair was showing. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And we July 14, 1995 went in like this and then the first thing they did was spray us with DDT powder, down the front, down the back, in our hair and down our legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And then we went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">wards</span> and there were just. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">They were all men that we had in that particular <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> and it was just -- they were skin and bone, like skeletons.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  By <span class="DLF">wards</span> , do you mean that these people had already been removed to <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> or to some kind of <span class="BUILDING">temporary facility</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Were they still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> itself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they were like <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">We called them wards because they were all in -- they were all in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunkbeds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">They didn’t have any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sheets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Some of them were fortunate enough to have straw on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> -- in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Just lying there, just with their wide eyes, because they were so emaciated. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And they were suffering from many diseases and we were told we really couldn’t touch them and they were not to touch us, because of all the diseases they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And our main thing to do -- we couldn’t give them any food, we started with sulfa drugs, sulfaphisol, because that was the antibiotic of that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And when I tell you they had to take six or 10 pills at a time, it wasn’t easy for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And I remember several days later, after they removed the dead, you would see all the pills left in there, under the straw, in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> that they just couldn’t take.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  They couldn’t swallow them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  Couldn’t swallow them, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">But they were very happy in their way, that they could show their appreciation. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">They were so weak, it was just -- they could scarcely July 14, 1995 talk, half of them and -- but they knew you could tell where -- their eyes, that they knew we had come to liberate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And that was just every day, the next day when you'd go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> , there’d be X number of inmates who no longer were there -- patients, I should call them, who were -- had died through the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And that was day after day after day. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">It was very, very depressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And -- and difficult to cope with even at that age, cause we had never seen anything like that and couldn’t understand why all this had happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  What were you told about it before you --
ANSWER:  We really weren’t told that much, it’s just that this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> the Germans had and that we were going to, you know, release these men and send them off to <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , where they could be treated properly, which is what they did, those that they could, they stayed until they were a little stronger. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And they did eventually have liquids and some form of nutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">But it was just total devastation to see what people could do to other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Human beings, these were human beings and they were just unbelievable skeletons.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  You said you weren’t able to touch them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  No, they didn’t want us to touch them because they had all kinds of diseases and they didn’t want us -- and there was nothing -- we couldn’t bathe them, they had the -- some others -- town people, I think come in and help clean them up or take care of July 14, 1995 them as far as minor little things. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">They were too weak to be handled or really treated in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  These were the local Austrian citizens who volunteered or were pr-pressed to --
ANSWER:  No, I don’t know where they really came from or who they were, but I know that someone else -- all we did mainly was just go from patient to patient and wait until they took all their pills, it was just constant -- cause there were many that we had in these large <span class="INT_SPACE">wards</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  And how long did that go on for? </span><span class="sentence" id="281">How long were you there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  Well, let’s see. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I guess maybe three or four weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And by that time, each day -- well so many had died through the night and then each day some would be moved to safer <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , so that little by little, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was em -- being emptied. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And we remember looking out of the <span class="DLF">ward window</span> one morning and they were -- two patients were walking by with the carcass of a horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">You could see the frames of his bone structure and the ribs and couldn’t imagine what was happening and they were of course had ki-killed the horse and were eating the -- the meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">It was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And down at one corner of our <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> , one patient was cooking -- had collected some weeds from the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , the campgrounds and he was cooking them and that -- that’s what they existed on, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  So some of the people there were able -- were up and around, not --
ANSWER:  Yes -- July 14, 1995
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, some were. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Even though they were just skeletons, they were able to walk around. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">They were weak and they shuffled and -- but they still were determined and of course when they saw the Americans, they knew they were going to be all right, so that that encouraged them to use up every ounce of strength they had, which they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">QUESTION:  Did they try to talk to you at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  Well, the communication, of course we didn’t speak their language, so it was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">But sometimes you could almost know what they were -- I -- they were grateful for our being there. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And we were women, which they didn’t know at first what we were, cause we had everything covered up. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">But -- and then they realized that we were nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And we had Red Crosses on our arms, so they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">It was just an unbelievable experience, cause then as we would go back through the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , we saw all these mounds of bones and bodies and the huge <span class="DLF">trenches</span> that they’d just tossed all the bodies in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">QUESTION:  They were opened --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  Trenches they had --
ANSWER:  Until they filled them to their capacity and then they would bulldoze the dirt back over all these corpse.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  That was going on while -- while you were there? </span><span class="sentence" id="303">July 14, 1995
ANSWER:  While we were there, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We saw that. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">It was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">It was a horrible thing that had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And I feel that’s why it’s important to -- this is part of history and it -- 1t should be taught in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , what happened there, because there are non- believers, which doesn’t -- hardly seems possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  Had you known anything about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> bef -- ear-earlier that spring, before you arrived there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I didn’t know anything about them, mm-mm. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Had no idea, had no idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">QUESTION:  Hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And how long were you there then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  I think it was three or four weeks, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I know we were there in May. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I think we must have come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in June. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Our reward for the experience at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> was to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , which was -- we were very, very anxious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">QUESTION:  I bet.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION:  Were -- were you writing letters <span class="BUILDING">home</span> during that time that you were there, trying to describe that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  Yes, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">My mother saved all of my letters and I have all of the -- I have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">All the ones -- and of course they were disbelieving, they couldn’t imagine what was going on and what we were going through. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">But they knew it was true, or it wouldn’t be there in the letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">July 14, 1995
QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Wh-When you came back -- excuse me -- when you came back and finished your service, was that experience something that you reflected on frequently in those years after the war, or was it something that you tried to forget about or --
ANSWER:  Well, you never forget about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But sometimes it was difficult to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">We didn’t discuss it all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They -- they were aware of what we had experienced.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  Your family, you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  And your friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  That’s true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">QUESTION:  Did people sort of tiptoe around you on that subject, not wanting to ask because they thought it would be hard for you to talk about? </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And was that the case, that 1t was hard to talk about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">For awhile I think it was difficult, but then as time went on and you reflect back and of course then when we’d get together with our girls or our nurse friends, we talked about it, but we didn’t really dwell on it, because it was painful, 1t was a horrible thing that had happened to these people who were just human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Innocent people. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I never saw any women or any children there. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">We just seemed to have the men on our section. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">July 14, 1995
QUESTION:  And has -- how do you think that experience, having seen what you saw at such a young age, it -- how did that affect your life? </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Did you think about it during the years at all, did it -- do you think it changed you in any way that you can measure, as a person?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  Probably made me a stronger person. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Not understanding of what I had gone through, but I knew that -- and a great compassion, I’ve always been compassionate, but I think this really encouraged me to be even more so and to -- to treat all kinds of people as you would yourself have treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I think it’s -- we’re all created here and it’s- you just don’t do these things to a human being.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  Have your children asked you about it?</span></p>
