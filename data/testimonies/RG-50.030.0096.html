<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Could you please tell us your full name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Harold B. Herbst.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  When and where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> on February the 19th, 1912.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Tell us a little bit about your childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  My father at that time had these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vending machines</span> that were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subways</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">It was quite a nice business. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">But when World War II came along, they couldn't get sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">So he had to let the business go, and we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> my dad became a businessman and opened up a <span class="BUILDING">laundry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">From there on I spent the rest of my life so far in that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> , <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Now, during the childhood the things I can remember, the things that stick out, is that as a child my mother had my brother and I sitting on her lap on a <span class="DLF">windowsill</span> on <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span> watching the parade coming back from the first world war. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I also had the pleasure of riding in one of the last horse-and-buggy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Then the next thing of memory is when I was 12 years old I started taking piano lessons, and when I was 14 I started playing square dances professionally with a fiddle player, violin player. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Square dance people prefer to call themselves fiddle players. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Then I went to the public school system in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> and graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> after I dropped out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when I was in eleventh grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">When I dropped out, I got interested in music again and went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vaudeville</span> for a period of about three, four months. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And when I came back, I had a good friend who talked me into going back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And he enrolled me into the <span class="BUILDING">Castech</span> (phonetic), which is one of the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that was set aside for advanced students. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I was fortunate because my friend happened to be the director of the Board of Education at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And I went through the school system of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> , <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Castech</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Then went to <span class="BUILDING">Wayne University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> and continued my education into the <span class="REGION">medical field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Premedics was at <span class="BUILDING">Wayne University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Medics was at <span class="BUILDING">Wayne University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I graduated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wayne</span> as a doctor and immediately after spending a short period of internship became a member in the United States Army as a first lieutenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  What year did you graduate from <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And then I had my internship, and I started residency. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And from the residency I was drafted and ended up in the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Went in training at a <span class="BUILDING">field hospital</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  When was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  That was in '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And for the purpose of training for a majority of -- for a major.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Did you specialize in anything at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  At that time I was in surgery. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I was a resident in <span class="BUILDING">surgery</span> , and I continued that. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">When I was in the Army, I was placed in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> as a surgeon for the <span class="BUILDING">170 VAC hospital</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  Where was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  At that time it was just being organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We were the youngest group of enlisted men. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">The doctors were quite young. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">It was more like an experimental hospital for the Army because they used to always hire -- not hire -- but place people of 35 or older in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and save the young fellows for the infantry and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So we were quite a young group in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">From there we went overseas in March.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  March of '43?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belfast</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span> , our first stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We were training our enlisted men for hospital duty in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and were getting acquainted with the materials that we had to use when we were on the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The training would be every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">The enlisted men would have classes and would actually practice on each other to develop their techniques. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">From there we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denby</span> (phonetic), which was in <span class="REGION">North Ireland</span> -- <span class="REGION">North England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denby</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> -- we were there again training waiting for the invasion to occur. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The invasion came, of course, on the 4th of June I think it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">The exact date I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But we were scheduled to go behind the Army and over to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in July, the first of July. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And that's when we went across the <span class="REGION">English Channel</span> and into the <span class="REGION">French territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">From there we were placed at first with the first Army, who was at the beachhead wiping up the remains of pockets -- the remaining pockets of Germans that were left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It was the policy at that time for the Army to move forward as fast as 1t can and not try to destroy all the Germans as we go but bypass them and let the infantry come in and finish up the work that we started. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">That's when we first started seeing patients in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">From there we followed to the third Army with Patton, and this was in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">The first <span class="NPIP">place</span> was a beachhead. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">The second <span class="NPIP">place</span> was the base of the Brest peninsula, and the third <span class="NPIP">place</span> we went to -- and this was in a matter of less than a month or so -- was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Crosan</span> (ph.), </span><span class="sentence" id="63">which was a little bit north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">As I said, we were with Patton, and we were transferred to the 9th Army at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And then we finally came back and went back to Patton, and we followed them clear -- one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hospital units</span> that followed him clear across Europe until the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We were in all the major battles at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brest</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodan</span> (ph.). </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And then we got involved in the Bastogne, which was where the battle of the Bulge was. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We were the only <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> functioning in the Bulge proper at the time, to our knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We didn't know of any other <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">In fact, our <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was listed as being missing because the communication was so bad during the Bulge. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">During that time we worked as much as 12 hours every day anyway, but I can remember that I saw 28 -- did 28 operations in those 12 hours we were so busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">As for the surgeons in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> , we spent most of the time in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> doing surgery. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Very little time to explore too much around the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And we were always kept busy because we were behind Mr. Blood and Guts, Patton, and he moved fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">From there we went on and ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> when the peace came, when it was declared, armistice was declared. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And it moved back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> where we at that time started to disband the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> in 19 -- in fact, I arrived back in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> New Year's of 1946.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Let's just back up a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Let's trace some of the things that you commented on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  That's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">During that trip across the continent of Europe, we came very close to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> (phonetic) I think was the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And I was sent on a mission by the colonel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And in the course of conversation with a police officer in a police station, he told me that the Germans had just left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> that was based in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in one of the most -- one of the larger ones and most famous for the various things that they did and the cruelty that left a mark on people for life. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He gave me directions as to how to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">He told me it was a five-mile route, and he showed me the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I got in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">a Jeep</span> with my driver. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We went out to see what we could see. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I'll tell you the story of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">It was riding through a <span class="REGION">countryside</span> which was green and very interesting 1n itself, and we came upon the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  How long a ride was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  It was five miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So I would say probably about 20 minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Not too much of a ride from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">In fact, it couldn't be too much of a ride because part of the story -- the prisoners would be paraded down the same <span class="DLF">road</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> on weekends and paraded through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where people would throw garbage and everything else on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Did you have any particular thoughts on that ride out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  At the time riding out I didn't know what I was going to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We had heard all sort of rumors of the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We had taken care of our own soldiers who happened to be captured at the Bulge and came back to the unit after we overran the Germans, and the average -- of our own soldiers -- the average weight they would lose would be 38 pounds in a matter of two and a half months. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And they would tell us the stories that they had, and we thought that was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">But we found out that it wasn't nearly as bad as what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">When I walked into the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , there weren't any other soldiers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> at that time, and I felt that I was probably the first one through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">The odd part about it -- the prisoners were walking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">The <span class="DLF">gates</span> were wide open. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">The prisoners were walking around in groups and talking, but I couldn't understand why there was no American soldiers or anybody who would guard the <span class="DLF">gates</span> or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They were wide open. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Later on I found out that what had happened is that the SS troopers who were running the camp fled from the camp on April 11th, and the underground which was in existence in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , in and about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , took over the camp with the help of the prisoners and started straightening out the camp before the American soldiers even arrived, which was a day or two later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  What did you see at the <span class="DLF">gates</span> when you pulled up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  When we pulled up, there was a big emblem on the top of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> which stated -- and the words might be not exactly right -- but it said, "You enter through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> , and you leave by the way of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> " or <span class="DLF">chimney</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="109">Chimney" is the word they used. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">That was there in German in a great big emblem. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It was very prominently in a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> where you couldn't help from seeing the emblem. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Then when you walked into the <span class="DLF">gate</span> in front of me --
QUESTION:  The <span class="DLF">gate</span> was open?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  The <span class="DLF">gate</span> was open, and prisoners were walking in and out freely. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">No resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Nobody checking them or anything like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Now, how long was that after the liberation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  How long after the --
QUESTION:  Liberation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> did you go in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  The SS troopers left on April 11th. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">This must have been either the 13th or the 12th -- the 13th -- that I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I can't remember the exact date because when we were working like we did, we didn't even know what date it was sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">In the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> we didn't keep track. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But it was that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I have it on the chart.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Did your driver stay with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  The driver was with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">It's customary that -- I was a captain at that time, and it's customary that officers didn't drive a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">We had always a driver to drive us, and he also entered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  You walked in on foot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  We drove up there in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and left it outside of the first <span class="DLF">gate</span> or right inside of the first <span class="DLF">gate</span> and walked from there on. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Right in front of us was three <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Quite large. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Went up about three to four floors in height. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And they were stationed one next to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And I remember walking up to the -- the first two you couldn't get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">They were locked. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> were locked. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">There was nobody walking with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Nobody to stop me or prevent me from doing anything I wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And my purpose was to see as much as I could and try to see what this was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But the third <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was open, and I have taken pictures of that, which we'll probably show later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And I had the opportunity to talk to the prisoners 1n the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and some of the stories that I'll tell you are from what the prisoners have told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We had a pretty good idea before I went in there from our stories that we got out of our own soldiers and the prisoners that we took about things that were happening in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but until you actually see them, it's hard to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">In fact, when I came out of the Army, I didn't talk to anybody or even take all the things I had put in my locker and so forth that I'd brought back with me for over 46 years until now because it's nothing that you like to talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Besides that when you start telling the story, the people -- they look at you, and they say, oh- they have the look that we really can't believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Well, the same ideas went through our head when we were looking at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">How can you believe this? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">After I got through visiting the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and talking to the men, they would -- when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> became crowded --
QUESTION:  Let's back up a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">You were looking into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and what did you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Well, there were these little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> that they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">They were about six-by-four's. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And they were originally made -- and part of this comes from the prisoners themselves -- they were originally made for four people to sleep in. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And there were three decks going up of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> the length of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> on both sides of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> got crowded, they'd double up. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And sometimes they had as many as twelve men in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that would sleep three. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And the sanitary conditions were terrible, and the stories that the prisoners told is how these people would get sick and have dysentery or so and would not be able even to go to the corner of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> or so -- wherever they could go -- and they couldn't even get out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So whatever they had to do they did, and from the top it just drained right down to the prisoners below. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">My impression at that time after I left that was that these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were probably the very last <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> the prisoner would be put in before they would be put to death in the <span class="INT_SPACE">furnaces</span> or other means. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Many of them died from disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Were there people in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> --
ANSWER:  There were many people in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that I spoke to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  What --
ANSWER:  There were at least five or six in one of my camera shots.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  How did you speak to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  The prisoners that were in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> wouldn't give you an idea of what happened to the other two <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> because they were the most recent prisoners, and they looked like they were still well fed. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They were entirely different than what was remaining in the other two <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , which we couldn't get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">But we know about them because we got the story back that they had to close those <span class="DLF">doors</span> because they couldn't leave these people walk around. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">They were infected with all sort of diseases, dysentery, and many of them were 1n the last stages. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">You couldn't do anything for them anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So they locked the <span class="DLF">doors</span> on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  How did you communicate to the prisoners you talked to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Well, that's the interesting part. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It's amazing how many Germans were able to speak English. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Then you find out that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> part of the school system teaches the children when they're in the third, fourth grade -- they start them on three languages -- German, French and English. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And this is part of their educational system.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  How large was the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> when you went in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  I'm sorry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  How large was the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> when you went into them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Let me see if I can estimate. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">32 by -- they were much larger than 60 -- I'm thinking of a <span class="DLF">telephone pole</span> , which are usually 32 feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">They were much larger than 60 or 75 feet in length, and in width I would say about 40 feet or so, each <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I didn't have an opportunity to count the amount of cubes that were in there, but that would be my estimate -- what I would estimate them to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  What was the response of the prisoners to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  It seemed they were unusually quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">They didn't react in a normal way, and I got the feeling they were afraid that tomorrow the Americans would be driven out and the Germans would be coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So they sort of didn't speak too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">You practically had to force them to give you answers sometimes by talking to them and sort of getting answers from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But that was the feeling I had because they didn't -- even when I walked through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they didn't even bother to look up to see who was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So that the feeling I had is that they all had -- frankly, one of them said that, "We don't know how long you're going to be here." </span><span class="sentence" id="187">They were afraid that the Germans might return, and that was the impression I received. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">But the funniest thing -- not the funniest but one of the most memorable parts of that particular time that I walked through these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , walked around the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> -- I was walking in back of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> just to see what was back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And as I walked by, a little <span class="DLF">window</span> that probably was about one foot square or thereabouts -- I heard a voice, and I turned around and I saw a living skeleton talk to me, was talking to me, and he said, "Thank God the Americans have come." </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And that was a funny feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Did you ever talk to a skeleton that talked back? </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And that's what I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Later on I saw mounds of these living -- I mean these skeletons that the Germans left behind them. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">That brings back the story that when the prisoners -- when the SS troopers left, the underground took over, as I said, and they cleaned up a lot of the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So that didn't exist very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">When I left those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , I went up to the <span class="BUILDING">administration building</span> , which was closer to the front of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and then talked to several of the prisoners there and one in particular who had a specimen bowl that we usually use in <span class="BUILDING">labs</span> -- glass specimen bowl that was about -- oh, I'd say about ten inches high and about four inches wide. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And in there was three sections of skin that had tattoos on them in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vase</span> which was saturated in a liquid of preservative. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And the prisoner told me -- and he held it up for me to take a picture of -- he told me when the prisoners would first come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they would be lined up. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And the Commander's wife would walk down the <span class="DLF">line</span> , and wherever she saw anybody with a tattoo she would point to them, and that was the last they saw of the prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And this is the stories from the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And it just happens that what they were doing -- they would get the skin off the people, and they were making lampshades out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">These lampshades were in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I didn't have a chance to get into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> at the time, but my nurse did with other nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And they had witnessed about four or five lampshades that were made out of -- the top of it was made out of the skin of men with tattoos on them for them to give. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">One in particular was made for Goehring -- and this is from my nurse that she had seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">It was made for Goehring, and they said this was made only of the fliers that were downed in the war that they had taken these tattoos from. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">That was one of the things that sort of makes you feel very empty <span class="NPIP">inside</span> to think that people would be that barbaric. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">The Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> 
QUESTION:  One moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">When you came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , you were by yourself with your driver.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  I was with myself and a driver all the way through it except when I -- pardon me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  Did the rest of your unit join you at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Just the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">We walked around ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">There were many people, as you will see, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , but they never came over and tried to start a conversation or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">They'd walk through -- just like I said, I think they were afraid --
QUESTION:  You had said your nurse had seen evidence of skin that was made into a lampshade, and I was wondering --
ANSWER:  Oh, she had been in -- she actually got into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">That was a week or so later. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So that they had different -- incidentally, Eisenhower dictated an order that every person in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> would be taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to see what the Germans had done there because they denied that they knew anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">In talking to the prisoners, they would tell -- they told me that on weekends they would be paraded through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , like I mentioned before, and these people would be lined up throwing the tomatoes and garbage and everything else on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">That was so ridiculous to think that they would deny that they didn't know what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  Let's go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">You left the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and then you said you walked over to the <span class="BUILDING">administration building</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  Will you repeat that, please.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  Let's go back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">You had left the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and then you started to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And you saw aman holding the --
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">That was at the <span class="BUILDING">administration building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">On the right was the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> for the SS troopers, and on the left was the administrating building itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And down on the right there was a wired-off place with irregular -- the wire they use for entrapment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION: <span class="DLF"> Barbed wire</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER: <span class="DLF"> Barbed wire</span> where they used to put the prisoners in when they first came off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They'd march them in there, and then they'd pass them in through the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and give them their clothes they were supposed to where and orient them. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And that was right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Then down from there the <span class="DLF">road</span> continued on, and there was another section that led to another <span class="REGION">area</span> which probably was the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> for doctors or the officers and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">At least that's what I interpreted that to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We had nobody to guide us. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">We just went through there, as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And on the other side of that was <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> , and then the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> from the back was guarded by two <span class="BUILDING">guardhouses</span> on each side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> so that -- separating it from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Later I found out that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was sectioned into three different sections. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">They had the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and then they had the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent camp</span> they called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And that was put up later on for the Polish people when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> started sending the Polish people into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Then the <span class="BUILDING">administrating building</span> , as I said, was the one we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And the SS troopers had their <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there on the right side. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And they had the <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factories</span> , which I didn't see. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I think they were back in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  What were your thoughts as you were walking through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  Like walking through a different world. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Not used to the tragedies that occurred there. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">The pictures of the -- they had these dummies at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> showing how they were whipped or clubbed -- actually, 1t was a club. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They had another one hanging from a limb, which represented hanging from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And then they had, of course, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">You could see those. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Great big stacks, white stacks, back there that you could see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Now I'm trying just to think if there's anything that I can think of --
QUESTION:  Well, then you were moving along --
ANSWER:  Then we saw the piles of bodies next to the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , some of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , of these skeletons of the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And the expressions on their faces -- what were faces -- were that of horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">You could just read probably the pain and agony they must have gone in before they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">The stories that go along with that is that they would be told to go into this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And as they would turn the corner to the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> leading down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> were, they would be clubbed on the head until they were supposed to be unconscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And then they'd roll down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and eventually be put into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">If] remember right, there's about maybe 10 or 12 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> in a row lined up in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> with each <span class="DLF">door</span> in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">That was at that time I went in they were still warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And some of the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were open, and you could see the remains of the body. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">What had happened is on April the 5th the order came down to the SS troopers that they were to evacuate all Jews to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">They were trying to clean up the evidence that might be left behind when the Americans came through. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">That was the impression I had, and I think that was probably a fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So that the next day they started evacuating all the Jews from all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And then later on when I got back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , I was interested enough to look up some of the history that was in the books. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">In fact, just more recent than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And I found out the reason for what was happening and how it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">The underground was sabotaging the orders so that slowing down the evacuation of the people that were to be evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And it figures in one of the write-ups, recent write-ups, there was about 25,150 people evacuated in that time that met the death penalty. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">If they were evacuated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , that was noted to be the entry for the termination which Hitler called the final answer to their problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">QUESTION:  Can you describe the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> in more detail?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">As I said, the <span class="DLF">doors</span> of -- several of them were still open, and the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> if you call 1t a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> -- I think 1t was just a murder box -- the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> would be large enough to take a body and slide it all the way into the flames. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">The heat was generated by coal or so below. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">That was my impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And the remains that were still in there were those that they didn't have a chance to finish. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">In fact, the bodies we saw <span class="NPIP">outside</span> were left there only because time did not permit them to put them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">One of the prisoners said that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> were running day and night for almost a week before I was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  When you went down into the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , did you go with some prisoners who explained anything to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  Only the question of how they would lead these men into the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And that was -- really that was gotten out -- down in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> there was nobody there but myself and my driver. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We were alone down there, and I took these pictures, which we may show, showing the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">When we were down there, there was nobody there with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So the conversation about what was happening I got after I left the crematortum and was back on the <span class="DLF">road</span> and talked to some of the prisoners about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  What did the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> look like from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  My impression, if I can recall in going back years, was a white <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">It looked like a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> really. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">A white <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And all I could see in my mind is the one side of it because I took the picture that I did at that time from that side. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">It was well painted. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">It looked like a very pleasant <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I understand the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> also had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> -- not the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> -- but the boxes to put them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">The <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Both <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> were <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">QUESTION:  When you went in, did you know what you'd be seeing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">ANSWER:  I didn't know what I was going to see, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I just followed the course of -- the man told you, "Go in there, and go right down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I don't even know who told me that, but it was obvious that's what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">The <span class="DLF">stair</span> was at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Then you'd walk down. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Then the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> was immediately -- if you turned right, it was right in front of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">The face of the <span class="DLF">opening</span> were toward the side that you came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">The back was that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">At the time we went down there, the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> were clean and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">They had cleaned up a lot, but I understand it was quite a messy <span class="NPIP">place</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">That's all I can remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  When you came out of the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , then where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  When I came out of the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , I continued my walk, which took us down toward the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the better <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We didn't go in any of them, but we saw them from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> where probably the doctors or the officers would stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And that took in the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">The administrating compound is what I -- two or three <span class="DLF">streets</span> down and blocked off by another <span class="DLF">street</span> going to the left with the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> with the SS troopers on this side and the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> on the other side and the <span class="DLF">wired fences</span> where they put the prisoners when they first came in for registration to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  Did you talk to any of the prisoners while you were walking around?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  Not while walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">But I would stop and start a conversation at the time, and during that time they would mention some of the things that happened to the prisoners such as that when they were strapped, there wasn't only -- not strapped but when they were hit with these blows with this -- it was about a two-inch round bat if you'd call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And it looked like it was displaying from a tree limb or so because you could still see where <span class="NPIP">places</span> from the limbs of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> would come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It would be jagged. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">It wouldn't be smooth. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">They would say they would hit those people and sometimes let them stay there for a day or so just so other prisoners would see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And by the end of the day that person was swollen up and disfigured tremendously, and many of them wouldn't even get off there alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Stringing up was done the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">They strung them up in a fashion where their hands were tied up behind them and their head was dropped down so that as a medical man you wondered how the person could survive just in breathing with the weight of the head down. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Again, they would be swollen up laying in the sun for a day or so before they took them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And those are the stories that fed back. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">The impression was my own as to medically what would happen with the person in that position. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">It was a very uncomfortable position to be in. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It in itself would eventually lend itself to death instead of just hanging by the neck, which 1s quick.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  Did you feel the need to render any medical assistance to any of the prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">We -- at the time absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">We couldn't interfere into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">What we did do 1s we came -- we -- when I say "we," what I did and probably other doctors -- before I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> started filling up with other doctors or GI's coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and the MP's were at the <span class="DLF">gates</span> , started to be at the <span class="DLF">gates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So I got in just ahead of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">At that time they were instructing the soldiers not to give them any of our K-ration -- which is that sweet candy bar that the soldiers would carry around in case they were on the battlefront and they needed some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It was 100 percent energy -- with the idea that if you gave them that, they probably would die because it was too rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And this is something we found out in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> when the post was done on some of these prisoners that we even received back from our own men that were captured only for two and a half months. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Their stomachs started to shrink down. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And instead of being a typical stomach, it shrunk down to a small -- almost to a tube-like effect, which is interesting to know because I never knew it before I saw it there that the stomach will shrink down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  Besides not giving them food, did you have the urge to help any of them medically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  That was done by another group. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">We were behind the Army, third Army, and our job was to follow the third Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We were the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that took care of all the casualties behind Blood and Guts, which you know as General Patton. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And our job -- we had to move with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And General Patton stopped for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">His idea was to go across the continent and get the Germans off into little pockets and let the infantry come back and clean them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And that's what we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">We only saw very little of anybody from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We saw more from the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weidar</span> who were unfortunate enough to get involved with some of the prisoners when they were let free and were beaten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">In some cases a couple of them were hung by <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  Towards the end of the time you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> did the U.S. Army medical personnel come in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  They came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">There was another unit that took care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">It wasn't us. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">That's all I know about that because we had to move on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  What else did you see that first time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Anything else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I'm trying to think of -- I saw -- in one case I saw -- one of the prisoners was digging on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> with a little tiny ax or so, and I couldn't understand what he was digging a <span class="DLF">hole</span> for. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And I asked -- the prisoner came by, and he said, oh, he's burying his food. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">He said they bury the food, and then they felt that we wouldn't be there long. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">They wanted to have some food after we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And this came right from the soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">So he must have had a fact because I couldn't understand why he was doing it at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">But I think one of the methods of destroying the prisoners was a planned diet that gradually resulted in malnutrition, and the people really just died from lack of food over a period of several months, which gave -- the Jewish prisoners when they first came in were assigned to the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> to work or to the -- they had a <span class="DLF">stone mine</span> there that they were digging from. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Stones and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">They were getting labor done cheap by putting these Jews and prisoners to work in their <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factories</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">But along with that I think was this constant planned reduction diet, which ended up in these people dying or getting weak enough so they couldn't work, and then they were put into these -- and this is my own impression I had when I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> they were eventually put into one of these three <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> there just to be there and die and be burned through the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">QUESTION:  What were some of the other conversations you had with the prisoners while you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">ANSWER:  That's about all. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">They wouldn't talk, most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">They didn't go out of their way to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">If you talked to them, they would respond. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">That's how I got the answers I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">One other thing is they mentioned that when they would beat these soldiers -- or these prisoners -- or hung them up, they would strip them down nude. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">If you look at the bodies that you'll see in these piles, you would see the black and blue marks of bruises on what was left of the skin and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And I mentioned about the expressions. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And also that the bodies -- 1f you look at them, you think they all reached the same stage before they died because they all looked so similar in the amount of malnutrition that you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And I've seen many people in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that would take them quite a while to reach that stage of malnutrition. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So they weren't killed instantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">They were dragged on until they were weak enough that they couldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And then they'd get diseases, and many of them would commit suicide by themselves, and many of them would die from diseases and malnutrition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">QUESTION:  Did you know anything about any of the medical experiments that were performed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">They were using medical experiments, and the medical experiments they were using was, one, to study the effect of amputations and how to handle them. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And I'll tell you a little bit about that in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">The other thing was giving them poisons in trying the strengths of the different poisons on people. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And the other thing was using toxins that would irritate the skin like some of our gases do that we were using -- not we were using but the armies use sometimes in wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Those are the three or four elements that they were -- some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And I also understand they were experimenting a lot on birth control.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">QUESTION:  What's that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">ANSWER:  Sterilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">You see, the impression I received -- and this, again, was borne out later on -- they at first wanted the Jews to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they did everything to encourage them to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And then eventually in '41 I think -- 11th of '41 or thereabouts -- Hitler decided to kill -- take the final solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And that was his order. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was one of the places that used gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">They used cianide gas or carbon monoxide.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  You said they were doing experiments on amputation? </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Tell us about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  Well, I could see why. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I'm just associating what I saw and what I'm putting together. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">When we came across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brest</span> and we emptied their <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> -- which as we took over, we took over <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And then the responsibility was ours to take care of their people. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And we had probably a <span class="DLF">football field</span> full with many of the people -- most of the people had amputations. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And we stacked it up at that time to the fact that we had Penicillin, and the Germans only had Sulpha at that time as a drug. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Sulfanilamide. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And Sulfanilamide, of course, wasn't as effective as Penicillin was. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">At the time of war you've got to get these people off the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> as fast as you can because infection sets in almost immediate when they hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">In Europe the people used the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> to defecate on and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">They called this fertilizing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">So you couldn't trust the ground of being clean of bacteria and so forth so that it was necessary to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And the quickest way to prevent infection 1s to cut off the arm, cut off the leg to prevent it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  Let's go back to your visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Towards the end of your visit, you said more American soldiers and doctors came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">What did you say to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER:  We didn't say a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">They were just as much surprised at what they saw as I was when I came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">There was nothing to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">It was so terrible a thing to see masses of people with expressions of agony. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">You just got the impression of what it was just by looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">There was nothing to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">What can you say? </span><span class="sentence" id="423">You feel depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">You walk away, and you are convinced -- in fact, you go away with the idea it can't be so. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">It's hard to believe and realize what you have seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And this is my impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">In fact, even when I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , I wouldn't talk of it for the same reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I couldn't think that -- maybe I had a dream because the things that you see is so different than human beings are supposed to behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And people- you look at them and say they wouldn't believe it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And I think a lot of our soldiers did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">They wanted to forget the horrors of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And they'll tell you more about the comedy of war, what happens that's a little bit amusing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">QUESTION:  How long were you in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at that visit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Buchenwald</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  How many hours were you there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  About three hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Three to four hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  And then you left with your driver?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">ANSWER:  I left and went back to the <span class="BUILDING">unit</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  Did you report what you saw to anybody?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">ANSWER:  I told the officers where we stayed what I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And within the next day or so, the colonel gave permission for the nurses and so forth to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> so they could go and see it too. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And the girls would go off five at a time or so and go down in there and go through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">As I said, Eisenhower dictated that the people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> will be taken in there, and they made everybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> go through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to see what the Germans were doing because they kept on saying they didn't know anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And that's about all of the things that I can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And, as I say, a lot of things probably I saw I don't remember because I blocked them out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">QUESTION:  As you say, when you left, you saw other American soldiers coming 1n?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">ANSWER:  When I left, there were other soldiers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that weren't there when I first went in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  But you did not speak to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I mean, it's like going out of the <span class="BUILDING">funeral home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">You didn't look for conversation yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">You're depressed and feeling alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">You just want to -- you're lost in your own feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">You don't feel like talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">If anything, you get a lump in your throat. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">You're very depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">It leaves you not only depressed, but you have nightmares for a few days after about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Especially the one where I told you where I turned around and here was a skeleton talking to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I'll never forget that. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">The skeleton that talked to me was exactly the same as the ones -- the piles of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">So what can you say? </span><span class="sentence" id="463">There are no words to express the tragedies of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">There are absolutely no words. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I saw a lot of it right on the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> for that matter with dead soldiers all over the <span class="DLF">field</span> and crazy things. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">You don't try to remember those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">It's not anything pleasant to see especially as a doctor where you'd like to give help and so forth, and there's nothing you can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">This is the after effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And you walk away the same as any person. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">You walk away and say, "What's going to become of these people?" </span><span class="sentence" id="471">As it turned out, the people that were in the last two <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that I mentioned probably died right there without going any further. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Even though we'd do what we could for them, we couldn't do enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">When I say "we," I'm talking about the medical part of the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Not our unit but whoever took care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">We got papers over there, newspapers, from the different units which would communicate back and forth and give us an idea of what we would be seeing so that we knew what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">QUESTION:  We're going to have to stop the tape right at this moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  They're just going to change the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Did you say you remembered another experience in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I started to say something about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">One of the pictures I've taken -- Do you want me to go on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  -- where these prisoners were lying 1n this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> and also <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleeping bags</span> which we know weren't theirs and they probably got it from the SS troopers. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">But to them it was not like lying on the dirt and stuff in their own <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">They told us their <span class="NPIP">places</span> were terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Especially some of the prisoners got into very dirty <span class="REGION">areas</span> where they would be sleeping and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">The sanitation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was terrible back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> themselves, and that might not have been just at the very end stages. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I don't know what it was when they were functioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I don't think they could function in such a dirty <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">QUESTION:  You said you went back to your <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , and then how long did you stay there at that <span class="NPIP">location</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  Probably at the most a day or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I think we moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">On the 14th or 15th I think we moved out of that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and then on to the next <span class="NPIP">place</span> , which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city Wieden</span> (phonetic) I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="495"><span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wieden</span> or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">It was <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">There we stayed only three or four days and then went forward again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  Did you encounter any other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or <span class="BUILDING">detention places</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">From there on we were too busy taking care of -- we didn't get anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I mean I don't think we came near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">We might have. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">It just happened that this one we happened to be the first group that was probably close enough to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to be affected by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">QUESTION:  So then you just continued to move? </span><span class="sentence" id="505">What were your duties?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  From there on we were just taking care of our soldiers and prisoners and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">But we were busy 12 hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">At least 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And even then after that during the Bulge, most of us worked on 14, 15 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Incidentally, one of the prisoners mentioned that the Jews were given unusual cruelty -- they were very cruel treating the Jewish people there and that they would make them work in these <span class="BUILDING">quarries</span> 15 and 16 and 20 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">They would make them work a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">This was just mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">How it came up I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  This was told to you when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  Did I what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  This was told to you when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">What you just said about the treatment of the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">ANSWER:  Well, we -- I'm trying to figure out where I heard of that in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I think we even got that before we got into the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I think we got it in our own papers probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And that might influence the impression and probably stimulated the question and probably all they were confirming what we probably already suspected.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  What was your itinerary for the rest of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  Well, we followed the German Army -- I mean the -- chasing the German Army across Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And then at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bastogne</span> the Germ -- the counterattack and the Bulge -- you probably read about the Bulge. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And we survived that. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And then went on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> where the war ended, and that's where armistice was. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Regensburg</span> we moved back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzburg</span> where we for the first time were able to get into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and use the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> of the Germans, which was well taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">It was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with clean <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and everything else, and the instruments we used were most modern and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">But that was after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Then from there on, of course, we waited for the time when we were to go out -- go back -- and many of us were scheduled to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> at that time, and I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I was one of the younger officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I'm not young now, but then I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And finally <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> gave up before we were moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So I got back into the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> on New Year's 1946 and went back and continued my residency at the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that I was working before, Mount Carmen Mercy Hospital, (phonetic) and then got involved in industrial medicine and became the medical director of American Motors for 38 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">QUESTION:  Let's talk a little bit about how the war, your experiences, affected you, your experience at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> affected you. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Your thoughts as a medical professional.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  You never used it. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I never used it. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">In my experience that I had in the war doing almost around 3,000 operations, which many surgeons never see in a lifetime, the experience I obtained there was not recognized by the surgical specialty group. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So we never used it. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">We just -- it's something you put aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">It worked out you learned a lot of things doing that type of surgery. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">It's traumatic surgery, and it came in useful when I got into industrial medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">The knowledge that you obtain by experience is something greater than any book can learn you -- teach you. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So that it was there, but you didn't recall it yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">It just would pop up every now and then, something that you did before. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">But you never talked about the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I'd be the last one to sit in a group -- and they'd be talking about different things -- to say anything about the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">To me it's like you pull a shade down and say that's part of the life you -- it isn't pleasant to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">None of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">The tragedies in war are something you don't talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I wouldn't be talking here now if it wasn't for my darling daughter who insisted I -- and my nephew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">QUESTION:  What lasting effects do you think your experience at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> had on you emotionally, intellectually?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">ANSWER:  Well, did you ever see a movie that was very impressive and many years later you recall different incidents of what you've seen? </span><span class="sentence" id="559">That's the thing of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">You never forget about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">They're always in the back of your mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">The only thing is sometimes they're stimulated by something that happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And you say, "Gee, I could remember this." </span><span class="sentence" id="564">But you don't dwell on it or go out and say, "Well, I think I'll talk to this and that party about the war and tell them all the things I did" because you can't believe half the stuff yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">It's such an unreal experience to a person who goes through the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">People that talk the most are the ones who see the least because many of my doctor friends who were with me in the same unit -- we never discussed the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">We will discuss the comedy like you run into situations that you experienced during the war when you're visiting <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> or something like that, but you don't talk about death and murder and torture and the pain that -- it's amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I saw people walk into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with both legs shot out from under them, but they were walking on the legs, and both the femurs were broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I've seen fellows come in with a <span class="DLF">shell hole</span> that went up the back, went through the tin and went around the protecting helmet and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Miracles. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">You don't know -- the craziest things happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">So it becomes a world of thinking of reality and what doesn't seem so real.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  Did your experience at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> have a particular message to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I sit down, and sometimes I get very, very mad of some person who tries to say that, oh, that didn't exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">But you don't try to correct them because they're too dumb to realize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And besides it's hard for you to appreciate what you saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">It isn't appreciation, anyway, but it's just a feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">There's no sense of talking about something that isn't pleasant to talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I think even talking here is not a -- I shouldn't say this, but I'll tell you the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">It isn't anything pleasing to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">It's against what I usually do. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I don't talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">In fact, I've had many people ask me about it, and I don't know anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And that's my attitude. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And as a corporate medical director of a large corporation, I don't think even half of them even knew I was in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Not half. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I don't think any of them knew I was in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">That's how much I talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Even today I'm on the staff -- I was on the staff and still am on the staff -- but as an old man you have to retire a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I don't think many of the doctors I associated with know my experiences because you don't talk about unpleasant things. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">You try to -- the mind blocks out. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Thank God for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And that's in real life too. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">The same way with people that have miserable deaths and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you'd like to add before we finish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">But I'd like to add I think I've about out-talked myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I appreciate your patience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">QUESTION:  Thank you very much on behalf of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">ANSWER:  When I leave, I have a choking feeling sometimes like now because it just leaves you that way, depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">That's it. ( </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Commenting on the pictures )
ANSWER:  This was inside of one of the three <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that I first saw and explained when I came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And what you see here is the loose squares that were made for three, four people to sleep in and ended up sometimes sleeping as many as twelve. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And the fellows that are sitting on it are probably very new prisoners because they haven't lost any weight or they don't even look ragged. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And you can see that's about what it shows.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">QUESTION:  Now they're going to put up another picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Then when I tell you, just where it is, what it 1s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">ANSWER:  And keep it brief. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Just to the point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">QUESTION:  Can you see that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">QUESTION:  Will you describe to me --
ANSWER:  Is that a bunch of --
QUESTION:  It's like an open <span class="REGION">area</span> --
ANSWER:  And a bunch of men walking out in the middle of the <span class="DLF">street</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  Just where it is, what it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">But wait until I tell you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">ANSWER:  That's a picture walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span> in front of the <span class="BUILDING">administration compound</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">On the right side you see the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> of the SS troopers. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">On the left is part of the <span class="BUILDING">administration building</span> where the camp officials would stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And people are just walking around there freely with no worry about being stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So they're all prisoners of war -- I mean prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">QUESTION:  Are their clothes hanging on a <span class="DLF">clothesline</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">That must have been quite a novelty for them to get some clean clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">We don't know where they got it, but they got it in the picture there. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I can't tell you how they got it except that I think what they did is get it out of the SS troopers’ <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">QUESTION:  Now they're going to put up another picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Can you see that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">You can look at this picture, and you'll see --
QUESTION:  Wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">You're able to see that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="631">ANSWER:  It's okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I can see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">QUESTION:  Where it is, what it 1s -- wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  This is a picture of a man, one of the prisoners, holding up a specimen bottle that has three strips of tattoo, the skin that was cut off the bodies of the prisoners that gave their life for that practically. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And these are the type things that they would sew into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lamps</span> that they were making as part of the lamp, the top part. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">There were many lamps made.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">QUESTION:  They're going to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Do you recognize that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">If you look closely here, you'll see a man digging on the right -- is that right? </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Do you see it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">ANSWER:  -- with an ax. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And on the left is a barbed-wire fence where the people when they were brought in from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and the <span class="DLF">train tracks</span> and everything were back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> they were put in these cages for a while until they were given where they're supposed to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Questioning why that man was digging, the answer I got was that he was just burying food because they didn't believe that the Americans were going to be there very long and the Germans would be back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">QUESTION:  We're going to put a fresh picture there. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Can you see that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">This is --
QUESTION:  Wait, wait, wait.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  Oh, I'm sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">QUESTION:  You're able to see that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">This is a picture of the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And if you look closely, you'll notice that there are bones within the opening of the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I estimated that there were 12 of these <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> right next to each other, and three or four of them had their <span class="DLF">doors</span> open, and each one of them showed a similar picture that you're seeing here. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">These are the remains of people who have been cremated. ( </span><span class="sentence" id="658">New picture )
ANSWER:  That's a picture of the same thing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">QUESTION:  It's another angle. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">It's open <span class="DLF">doors</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  This is another view of several other <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">If you look back down if you can, it fades out, but you could see the <span class="DLF">doors</span> open and two or three of them behind that. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">When I was down there, it was still warm, and they were open to cool off. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And there's bones in every one of those representing the remains. ( </span><span class="sentence" id="665">New picture )
ANSWER:  Can you tell me what I'm looking at?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">QUESTION:  Well, he's going to enlarge it. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I'm not quite sure yet.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="671">QUESTION:  You won't be asked to go until you're sure of what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">He's trying to adjust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">ANSWER:  I studied these, but I have to recall what I saw under the magnification I used.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">QUESTION:  This is one of these smaller photographs that you brought in, and he's going to try and focus it. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">You won't have to explain it until --
ANSWER:  You give me a little hint as to what you see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">QUESTION:  I'm not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I think I see a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">ANSWER:  A <span class="DLF">front door</span> where a bunch of people are coming in and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> on the right side?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">QUESTION:  There's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> on the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Do you know what this 1s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  This is a picture of the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from the front to the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">If the prisoners were coming back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> later in the afternoon, most of them would go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , walk around and come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I just happened to come in and see this when they were coming back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I think they were all facing this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And if you look in the picture, you'll see that one of them showed an MP in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So it was later in the day when the MP started to take over, "MP" being a military policeman of the Army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  They're going to put in another picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">This is another one of the smaller pictures.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="696">QUESTION:  Do you remember what this is?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">ANSWER:  This is a picture of a group of men pushing a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , and on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , if you could see, there 1s -- it looks like a large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage pail</span> , five-gallon <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage pail</span> , but that's what they used to make their soup in. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And this is lunchtime, and they were pushing it down by the <span class="BUILDING">administration compound buildings</span> where the prisoners would come up and got a bowl of soup or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Could I talk to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Actually, it's not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage pail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">It's a 25- or 50-gallon -- it looks like a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage pail</span> , but they used it to put the soup in.</span></p>
