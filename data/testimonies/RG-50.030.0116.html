<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  Tell me about your childhood, with your brothers and sisters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  As far as I remember of my childhood, I used... My parents were strictly Orthodox people; but we have been four brothers at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . '</span><span class="sentence" id="23">Til about 14, 15 years old, we all attended <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> and never went even to a <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> ; because our parents had been so religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">They always sent us to <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Private...actually, a teacher--a private teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">A Rabbi, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And we took also, beside...uh... languages--like Polish, or other modern languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">What I studied was only private...private. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And as I remember, when I was 15 years old; and then the parents let us more or less do it our own way. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">We didn't go anymore with...uh...my father, like we used to every Sabbos [NB: Shabbat] to the shtievel | Yiddish: "<span class="BUILDING">house</span> " (of worship?)], </span><span class="sentence" id="31">und so weiter [Yiddish or German: "and so forth"]. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But...uh, we...we have been allowed more or less to go our own way, in some degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">But we always have been understanding..., we tried to be good kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Not to embarrass...uh... So I belonged to...uh...Jewish organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It actually a...a sport...um, like a sports organization; but it was a religious sport organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I used to help around at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , with business. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">It was assigned to do...uh...all, uh...different things, whatever; I always helped around. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Whatever they asked me, I always did, so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And in the evening, we used to spend in the Zionist Organization, where we...we...we learned Hebrew and once a week we had some dancing, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">More modern life. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">This went on, more or less, all my years; 'til actually the German, when they came in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I think it was the first of...uh...September. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">The first day when they came in, right away the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Because we had been afraid, actually, of Germans; and we went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And we had been for two, three days in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And the time come, we went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">This...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , was about 70 percent was burned out; but our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was still standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">The business, everything, was still like normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We tried to adjust ourselves to a normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">As I can remember, right away from the beginning...uh...was like a...a law. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">The German called a "Kommissar"--who was in charge of the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> --called us over; and he said that we all, from 13...age from 13 'til 50, will have to perform labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Every day, we have to go to the...to do some work. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So we used to go to the...the Jewish Kultursgemeinde. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Over there, we have been assigned; like mostly cleaning, taking away old brick, cleaning up <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Didn't make any different. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But in the evening, we have been allowed to go back at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Later on, they assigned me--mostly in mine age, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> --to a Steinbruch [NB: "quarry"] We used to mine stones; those stones have been for the...for the <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">They built new <span class="DLF">road</span> , and so those stones went to the <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And so this was pretty heavy work, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But still, I was pretty young and healthy, and I got adjusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And I...and I did my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I have the two other brothers-- because he was always in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And at this time, the German government...they needed...base...steel basement materials--steel. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">My oldest brother was always 1n contact with big manufacturer, Jewish people, who used to have supply from all kinds steel metal. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And if he supplied so many pounds--I don't....cannot recall the amount--you...you got a gréne binde [NB: "green band"]. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Start to wear the white and blue armband, so you got a green band. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">A green band meant that you could go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">You could travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">You could use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And you have...you have been restricted, but you still had a little bit freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So then my oldest brother saw that my youngest--uh, my older brother from me, the second brother-- had a grone binde, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So we didn't have to go to work every day, like the steinbruch, and do all public kind of works. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And happened to be...our parents, they had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> with a partner, with a gentile people. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">In the beginning, we didn't even wanted to go down to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ; because it was everything under his name, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We didn't want it to know...the Germans know that this our property, half was our property of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Because we know it if it is Jewish property, was confiscated. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">But the owner from the prop...from the partner from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , our partner the owner was arrested in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">This was with the first Polish intelligent[sia] what they took away. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They arrested him. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Two weeks later, came a notice that he did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">The clothing came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and he was not alive anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was not running right with nobody to manage, so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So my brother, through...he had some friends who had contact with the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And for money, they could make it that it's not for myself to go to every day to work for Zwangs [NB: "compulsory"] labor to be assigned... to have my assignment; my labor should be to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We lived already in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was on the other side in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , also out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So I got a I.D. card from Gestapo, that I can go..cross every day to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Cross ...I go outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and be over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We came... So I were came to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">My brother used to supply raw materials, because you couldn't get it at this time raw materials from the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">You have to have a special permission, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But my brother had connection; and we could produce again knives, spoons, forks...whatever we manufactured over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">But it was a problem that the...same way, labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">You couldn't pay a labor[er] more than the price from before the war prices, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And nobody wanted to work, because everything was already like <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Except what you got your rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Right away, Jewish people never got any rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So the problem was that nobody wanted to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Then my brother told me to try to tell those people who used to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> that we will pay them 2, 3 times as much [as] whatever is allowed by the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And he will be able to sell the merchandise to some friends, who had <span class="BUILDING">Jewish people stores</span> ; what he could given them a bill and he will actually get paid three times as much, too, for the merchandise. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">This went on...and I used to be always in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and this went on for quite a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Apparently, over a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">It happened to be that one of the workers in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , he was some dissatisfied--not with me, but with the ...with the lady from our partner. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And he went...he went to the Gestapo; and he said that the whole <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> belongs, actually, to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> belongs to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Whatever we used manufactoring, we had been always afraid that something can happen this week, or next week or [the] next week. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We used to carry away finished merchandise; and it was over there he used to carry the finished material to the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So he lived 1n our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">He had a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> where he used to carry finished merchandise to his <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Well, one day, I remember...it must have been like the middle of August. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I cannot recall exactly, but...uh...more or less in August. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was on a Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And I was trying in...at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> they told me, "You stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Don't stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Keep on trying to sleep over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Live over there 1n the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They always chased me to go out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to be in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">This was a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> ...a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , you know, to cross the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I came on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> ; I remember it was guarded by Gendarmerie. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Not by Gestapo, but by Gendarmerie. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And I knowed him; and he knowed me very well, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">His name was [Achtler (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I still remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Because he used to come to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> before Christmastime, and he used to wanted to send <span class="BUILDING">home</span> some knives or whatever we produce in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And we used to give him for free. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So he always was on very friendly terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And I came to the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> to cross the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">He says, uh, "Ausweis.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And I knowed right away that something is not right, because I know him and he knowed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And when he asked me this; and I laughed, and I took out my Ausweis and I gave it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And he tore up my Ausweis. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And he said, "Du zist...du bist selbig scheiss Jude wie jede andere. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Wenn die Mal probies das <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> [geschitten (ph)], dann ein Kugel in dem Kopf."’ </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And it means that he will shot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
