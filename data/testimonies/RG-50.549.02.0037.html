<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Why change your name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  I cha -- My wife was a schoolteacher, and for a first or second grade tea -- kids call her Mrs. Aroncheck and try to spell it, 1t wo-wouldn’t -- would have been rather difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And then, I didn’t want my children to stand out of the crowd with a strange name. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I wanted them more or less, be able to blend in, cause they knew immediate -- they knew how to spell my last name and they knew how to pronounce it, but it helped them in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in later days, because they were just born at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My daughter was born in ‘53, my son was born in ‘56, so she wasn’t -- he wasn’t even born yet.</span></p>

In a way, she didn’t want to give away that she was Jewish at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Let them guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Ahrens is a name that you have to guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Why was it important to her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  It wasn’t important. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">She was a schoolteacher, she was teaching in a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> at the time and it was not a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Maybe she would -- she just didn’t want to -- point to herself that, I am Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">However, she was proud of being Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Was there still, in the early 50’s, did you feel anti-Semitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">That could be one of the hidden reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Maybe subconscious, or I don’t know, I never tried to analyze myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We sort of looked at it for awhile, then we decided and we went along with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And I have never regretted.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Yasha. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">What did your wife call you?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  That is quite an interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">If I s -- go all the way to Adam and Eve, to the very beginning, my mother was in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> from 1934 to 1930 -- late ‘37. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">My father died in ‘31. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">She remarried, and she married an American man. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">His name was Epstein.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  First name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  I don’t even know his first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I never me -- I -- I pa -- I think I met him when he came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and he -- they met, but I don’t remember him. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">She spent time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and she made friends with a woman by the name of Sarah Kaplan. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Sarah Kaplan was married to -- or rather, Sarah Kaplan was a -- the oldest sister in the Kaplan family. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">One of her brothers married my grandmother’s sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">That’s why my mother became friendly with Sarah. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Sarah’s father was the youngest brother 1n that family. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So actually, when I came here, my mother introdu -- not introduced me, made me call her and arrange a blind date. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And that’s how the whole thing started. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It’s actually -- My mother was a shadchen -- th -- the -- the -- the matchmaker, at the time.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Used to be, or -- it’s strange, but I ha -- I spoke many languages at one time, and I sort of forgot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I regret it. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I regret 1t deeply, but I cannot converse any more in Polish, I cannot converse in Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I -- I used to be able to converse in Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I have great difficulty using these three languages, which I was fluent at one time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Is that partly psychological?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">It’s -- My problem was, when I came here -- and I came on a scholarship -- I was studying in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and I feel -- you’Il find my history of studies, what I have started in -- in 1940, under Stalin, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , then I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> again in 1944, after being liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">After the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> experiences and hiding, I sort of saved myself by going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> instead of being forced to go into the Russian army and become artillery meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I had no other, basically, I -- I had nothing in my background that would prepare me to ma- for th -- 1-1-1 -- to survive, to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">My family was quite wealthy and they sort of isolated me from normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I was not in touch with business. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">The only thing I knew is more or less engineering and education. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So I just kept going and I pursued the -- the career in engineering by going in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> and then being accepted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Turin</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  Why -- I-In your story, education is so central to everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Why is education such a compelling and defining source for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  This was my crutch for survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">That’s what -- Basically, that’s what helped me survive, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">In looking back, when we left my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown Lida</span> , in 1940, and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , the reason why we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , there were two-fold reasons, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">One, that my mother and myself, we were able to get the Russian passports -- acceptable Russian passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">By that, meaning that our occupation -- my occupation became student and my mother’s occupation becau -- became a working person, robotche. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">In spite the fact that we were Capitalists, according to the definition of <span class="COUNTRY">USSR</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">The reason why we picked <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , because I wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> had not <span class="BUILDING">polytechnic institute</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> got separated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lida</span> , because at that time, they made a separate <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> out of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">That would have meant crossing a <span class="DLF">border</span> and difficulty in getting in touch with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So, we picked <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , where we could sort of disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="97"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , normally a city of 150,000, at that time had maybe 300,000, with all the refugees coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">It was on the Russian side of the divided <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , from the -- after ‘39. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And I was able to -- I was accepted to the non -- the pothip -- to the <span class="BUILDING">Polytechnic Institute</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And that was my crutch, I figured I can -- I ha -- I have no other background -- I have nothing in my background that will allow me to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I had to be on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Fortunately, the Russians were offering scholarships. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Top students were getting a -- the -- a -- it’s not a scholarship, a stipend -- a living allowance and coupons where you could buy things or you could purchase things. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I -- I have looked -- I have my -- the booklet where they have entered my grades and I have never anything -- I never had anything below a B -- what you would call B in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Fact, I don’t think I had any B’s, I had all A’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  You said you kept it? </span><span class="sentence" id="107">You still have it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Not I kept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I don’t -- I have -- I have it, because when I came back in ‘44, it was strange, but the Germans, during their occupations, they destroyed the Polish intelligentsia -- I mean, they killed the Polish professors. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">In fact, they did it before the killed the Jews, they killed the Polish -- the Polish professors in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But the-they -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> itself was not bombed, was not destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So the archives of the <span class="BUILDING">Polytechnic Institute</span> remained intact. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And that was the reason why I was accepted, because they had everything on file, including my photographs, I could not claim that I was someone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And when they issued me the booklet where you enter the grades, they entered -- I s -- I still have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">If you want to look at it, I can show it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">You do want?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Yeah, I’d love to see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Hold on a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Oh, my gosh.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="889">ANSWER:  No, no one could predicted this thing is going to happen like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">No one could predict. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">First of all, the president that allowed me to stay here, was completely the opposite morally of what’s going on, and it was Truman. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">It’s interesting, but after I got my BS in ‘49, I have received a letter from the immigration authorities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , to report for deportation, cause I came here on a student visa and when you come on a student visa, you have to have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">The only <span class="NPIP">place</span> that I could find that would accept me from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> -- <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> would not accept me back, I was a Displaced Person, was -- I frankly don’t remember if 1t was <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Paraguay</span> , but one of those <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I think it was <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="895">So I went to the dean of foreign students and I said to him, “You know, my plans are to go for a Master’s degree, because engineers are now a dime a dozen.” </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Fact, at that time, engineers were getting 37.50 a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Was a g- graduating class had a lot of ex-GI’s 1n it, under the student bi -- say -- whate-whatever tha -- it was, that shu -- that ex-G -- ni -- that GI’s were allowed to study for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">So in order to compete in the -- in the -- 1n the -- in the wa-- 1n the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> better, I said, “Ill go for a Master’s degree.” </span><span class="sentence" id="899">So, he called the immigration in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and he said to him, “What are you going to take, my best man from here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="900">I got a BS with honors at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">He says, “He’s going to go for a Master’s degree.” </span><span class="sentence" id="902">So, “Okay,” he said, th -- th - they said, “Se -- Let him send -- send me the proper document-documentation,” and in the meantime, Truman passed the bill that I was able to stay here without any problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">But in ‘51, I got -- I got married to an American citizen, I could have -- but I never di -- I never claimed citizenship on the basis of marriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">QUESTION:  Why not?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="908">QUESTION:  Your wife -- Did you feel that as an American -- as someone who hadn’t been what you’d gone through -- what you’d gone through that she could even understand who you- who you were and what you were about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">ANSWER:  I don’t think she would understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">I don’t think she did understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">I don’t think that any American can understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">The things that I or other people went through are so traumatic that unless you live through it, you cannot express it, you cannot describe it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">QUESTION:  Did you talk about it with her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">In fact, I haven’t spoken to it abou -- with my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">It’s my grandson that 1s asking more questions than anyone else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="919">QUESTION:  Why didn’t you speak to your wife or your children about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="920">ANSWER:  Could have been maybe two reasons, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">One, they didn’t want me to talk about it, not to bring it out more, to more or less, let’s forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">The attitude was, let’s forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Let’s put it in the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And the other one was that -- that things were so horrible and so bad that I just didn’t want them to know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">There was no reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">They knew basically what happened, but not in fine detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">I don’t think anyone knows it in fine detail, because when I try to visualize that time now, the different situations that happened to me, the only thing I can say, like someone asked me, “How -- How did you manage to survive?” </span><span class="sentence" id="928">I said, “It’s nothing but pure luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">It’s nothing but luck,” because just like when you are in the -- 1n -- doy -- 1-1-in a war, and you are with another man next to you and a bullet hits him and not you, what determines it? </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Nothing but luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="931">QUESTION:  Seems it was more than luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">You were really canny. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">You knew how to assume other identities, even to the point of wearing the fatigues on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="934">ANSWER:  That was not a matter of survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">That was a matter of survival, but not a matter of life and death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="936">QUESTION:  It was --
ANSWER:  When it cames to li -- When it came to life and death, 1t was purely luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">I -- I have many situations where you would call -- it was the right decision at the right time. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Now, why did I make that decision? </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And I -- many times, I tried to analyze myself, why did I decide -- just like why did I go to the right and a -- a -- a -- or -- or not to the left? </span><span class="sentence" id="940">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">It just -- Something guided me internally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="942">QUESTION:  Do you think God had anything to do with it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="943">ANSWER:  Could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">I -- I -- I can’t say I believe in God, but I believe in a -- in a super being, in something that 1s there, that guides our destiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">I went -- Look, I came here. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I mean, I had my problems when I -- 1-1-in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="949">When I discovered my mother had cancer, I had Bell’s Palsy, which never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">I still have my left side of the face paralyzed. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">I had what they call a decompression. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">They remove one ear, they drill a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in your head and let the nerve expand. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">After that, I had to make a major decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">There was a su-suspicion, not that many years ago, that I had a cancerous kidney, so I decided to remove the kidney. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Well, I am fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Not so recently, I had angioplasty, with a couple of stents put in. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Mean, those are all decisions that I had to make on the spot, with the help of my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">My daughter is a doctor, a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">My son 1s a pharmacist. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">They can give me educated guesses, but you know, it’s like anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">The dec -- the final decision is mine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="962">QUESTION:  Do you think that the God or higher power, whomever may have -- who may have helped you survive, 1s the same one who oversaw the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">ANSWER:  If there is a proof that there 1s no God, that’s the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">There is a proof there 1s God is the people that survived the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">I mean, where -- that thing will remain unanswered, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">There’s no answer to that -- a question like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="967">QUESTION:  Did you pray at all during that period when you were 1n hiding in [inaudible]
