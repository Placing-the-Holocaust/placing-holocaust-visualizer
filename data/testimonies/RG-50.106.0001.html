<p><span class="sentence" id="1101">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1103">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Just obviously deprivation -- no food --
ANSWER:  Just mental.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1105">QUESTION:  -- and seeing the violence, the hardship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">Mr. Gelfer, you mention that there was 100 survivors from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">Is that -- how did you know that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">100 survivors of children, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1109">ANSWER:  It's a figure that's just been released into books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">I have the book, "I Never Saw Another Butterfly," which I bought in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> here, because my husband bought it for me when we were here for the opening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Which is a book of paintings and poems by children who didn't survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And the preface mentions also the figure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">But how accurate they are -- I know, but I always heard the same figure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">It's always been 15,000 and 100 survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">15,000 that went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at one time from the beginning to the end -- not that they were all there at the same time -- that went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And most of them went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1117">QUESTION:  Mm-hmm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">At some point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1119">ANSWER:  So I guess records were kept, because it's always been the same record -- the same figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1120">QUESTION:  Now, you say that people knew about the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> -- about the gassing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1121">ANSWER:  That I heard from my mother the night before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And it was -- she says it was just hysteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1123">QUESTION:  Mm-hmm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1124">ANSWER:  And disbelief that they were there so long they weren't going to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And, from what I heard is that the American Red Cross got word that this was going to be the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they were going to destroy this whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with everybody in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">They didn't want -- they knew, I guess, that it was all coming to an end in '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And they didn't want any visible signs of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">Just outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the countryside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , and was used as an <span class="BUILDING">army fortress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And they were just going to get rid of it all totally so there was no signs of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">So when this war 1s over and whoever -- Americans -- whoever came over, there would be nothing left to say, "Yes, there was something there at one time." </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And they had to do this kind of quickly where it was this was going to be over pretty soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">And so, they had to act very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And somehow the Red Cross got wind of this, and the Russians came in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1135">QUESTION:  Before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Do you have any idea of why you were sent there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">Why you and your mother were sent there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1138">ANSWER:  My mother, as I said before, was born of a -- born Protestant mother and a Jewish father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">My grandmother converted when she married my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">I think they were treading very easy at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">They didn't want to antagonize the Christians by having too many Christians killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">So my grandmother would say because of her age and she wasn't important as an old woman, 70-year-old woman, she wasn't going to do that much harm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">My mother, they weren't quite sure yet where she fit in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">She was not born of a Jewish mother, which makes a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Like I said before, they measured her -- the nose, the head and neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">And they really -- it took them a while to say, "Well, we're going to put you in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">holding camp</span> until we can figure out what we're going to do with these mischling -- people who were of half breeds or not quite totally Jewish." </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">There were a lot of -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> -- war heros, like Simon, whom they didn't want to kill off either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">We don't want a big war hero from World War I, who got the congressional medal of whatever in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we wanted no -- a lot of writers out there, musicians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1149">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1150">ANSWER:  People that they were just going to hold for a while and then see what happens type of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">They didn't want to leave them free, but they didn't want to send them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And also people like my mother that they couldn't decide quite how Jewish she was at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">I was lucky, because I was totally Jewish because -- well, almost totally Jewish, because I have a Jewish father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1154">QUESTION:  Mm-hmm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">But so it wasn't because of the fact that she was an actress, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1156">ANSWER:  I don't think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1157">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">It sounds more like the fact she was not Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1159">ANSWER:  Yes, definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">The rest was just.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1161">QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">I think that's all I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">Conclusion of Interview </span>
