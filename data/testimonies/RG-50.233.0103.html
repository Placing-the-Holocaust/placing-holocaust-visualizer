<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  We are speaking with Mr. Jack Polak about his father, Fredrik Polak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">The date is March 2, 1992.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  He was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> in August 1883. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">He was part of a very religious family, was the smartest of five children. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">One died very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">He had three sisters and one brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">So, there were six children, one must have died early, and the other four, he had one blind brother and three sisters, all married. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Two sisters without children, one sister without children. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">None came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My father worked himself to become an accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He was a very respected member of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , as well as of the general community he was a learned man. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">He was a fantastic friend for children. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I do recall distinctively that in summer vacations when we went to the <span class="DLF">seashore</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , all the children of all nephews and even many friends always came to him telling stories and even today I have certain stories and certain songs my father was singing at those <span class="DLF">seashores</span> which my grandchildren now treasure because they know it comes from their grandfather who they never knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He worked himself as an accountant very hard, however never knew how to make money on it because he became an accountant of many charitable organizations and on which he always charged the minimum. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">As such his entire life he went through week by week also many members of his family depended on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">He had to pay for his blind brother, he had to support his sisters many times, and as such we know he had always a hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Still, he was always happy and my father and mother had a very happy marriage and he was also able to bring the joy of being part of the orthodox family to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The Friday nights were wonderful testimony of how an orthodox family should live a Shabbat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Do you know about how he met your mother and when, and when they got married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  I don’t know much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">All I know is it was a very close relationship in all the sisters of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I will talk to you about my mother in a few minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">My mother came from a well- known family in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and every Thursday night all brothers and sisters of that family came together at one of the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> of one of the sisters of the family of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And these wonderful, joyful occasions for all of them to come together. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Almost none of them came back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  So your parents met then and married probably in the early turn of the century.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  They must have married, because I was born in 1912. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">There was one son born to them who died very young, at one or two years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So I would say that they must have gotten married maybe in 1907 or 1908. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">That is what I suspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">They lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My mother was a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">She was a teacher in shorthand and she was a teacher in (asked his wife) how do you call that? </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Wife: Sewing, but its not sewing clothes, it’s like embroidery and fancy stitches. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I don’t know how you call it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Crafts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Something, anyway she was teaching in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I know there was once a problem because, although they were orthodox, she never wear a wig and they wanted her to wear a wig. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">There was a big commotion in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> because how can a Jewish teacher in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But she got a certificate from the doctor that it would endanger her health to wear it and she got away with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I remember there was a big discussion about it at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">She was a very respected teacher in every way. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Not only that she later became part of the federal examination procedures in which she was part, really, of federal (wife: What they did is when you did your final exams from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> which were really exams, not just a test, official, the government would send a delegate to sit in on the orals. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">First the written on all subjects and then the oral. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And they would send always one person to sit there so the schoolteacher would ask the question and not add something, it was honor.) </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We lived in the first years of my life on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> of a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which was very cramped <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Certainly not rich living, to the contrary, it was very poor living. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I recall my own Bar Mitzvah reception was done at our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and people had to crawl on <span class="DLF">steps</span> which were very narrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Even Bar Mitzvah parties were not comparable, still I remember my Bar Mitzvah having a dinner Friday night, which was a fantastic dinner, at our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> pre-prepared themselves and the reception all prepared only at our own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">All our lives we were just making it. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">During the summer my parents always took in paying guests. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">That way they were able to give us a summer vacation on the <span class="DLF">seashore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We always had paying guests. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">In fact, one of the young paying guests we had is now living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scarsdale</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I always remember that little boy who came to us because his parents, at that time, paid us for him to stay with us at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  So, it seems your family life was very happy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Very happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Can you tell us what you know about what happened to your mother during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  My father and mother, I would say after I joined the practice, maybe I’m more materialistic than my mother and father, I really showed him that he should charge more and somewhere they got a much nicer living after I joined them. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">We were able to make some money and save a little bit money and they were able to move to better <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , and I would say the last years of their life was much happier. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Of course, they had their daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They had my older sister who was married to a very successful businessman and a nice man, although he may have been a womanizer, he was a very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I was very proud of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">My younger sister, who married that young columnist, was the darling of my father and they always compare my daughter and me with my sister and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I think I am treating my daughter the same way as my father treated his favorite, my sister Betty, and even today I have to talk to my youngest sister always, that Betty was always the love of her father. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">She knows that and she knew how to handle him too. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Betty had a very interesting life and she was a wonderful woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Even my first wife, like I say, was crazy about my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">My father was a fantastic man. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Even today when I talk to people, anybody I talk who knew my father always talks about him that he was such an unusual man. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So, as such, I have the greatest memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So we had a happy life and when the war started, yes, he saw they had no choice, they may have had a chance to go into hiding but 1t never dawned on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">It never dawned on all of us really how serious it was and what was going to happen to all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">For the last year of his life he was able, because of his importance in the Jewish community, to stay longer than many other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">The deporting started in July 1942, he was taken away in June 1943, as such he was a little bit longer than the normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">He was taken last of all for another four weeks, but even then he was not important enough to be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So he was taken away on July 23, 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Both of your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  Both, they were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">They went in a very prestigious <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , there were several rabbis in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I don’t know if you saw the movie. “</span><span class="sentence" id="81">Escape from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And you may recall how all these well-dressed people arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So my father and mother, the way they were dressed in their best clothes, arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They died two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Everybody who, I think the number is that 40,000 people went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> and I think about 100.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Fewer than 300 survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Fifty people survived the uprising.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  You got the number from Engle, because he was one of the few survivors.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Is there something about your mother’s personality that you could recall?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  My mother’s personality was also very outgoing, very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">A real mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I don’t recall any fights my parents ever had. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">They were just a wonderful congenial gamily. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">My mother came from a quite a big family. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Eight or nine brothers and sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Her father had died at a very early age. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">He was in the diamond industry, and my grandmother lived for a long time died, I think in 1936 or 37. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I knew my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">My mother came from a very close-knit family. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">All the sisters came together almost, like I said, every Thursday night and from that family only three survived in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">A niece, interesting enough, other people were not orthodox people. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">From that family, the three people were not orthodox at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">One went with the Palestine transport to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and they lost their only son and one other sister who went into hiding lost their only son and one sister and brother-in-law survived in hiding with their two children who are now living in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">She worked very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">She made sure that we got a good upbringing, but in the meantime they were both working, they had to make a living and still I never had any idea of poverty. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I knew there was no money, but I still never had no idea that we were poor at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Although we were poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">As such we had a wonderful life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Is there anything else about either of your parents that you can include? </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Do you know what they did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="112">They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> for a short time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> from June 43 to July 43, only four weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  You weren’t even there yet?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  No, I came, I was there for one week with them, so I saw them really for one week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  So that was the last time you saw them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  That was the last time I saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Just for one week. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">At that time already my young sister was with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">She was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> and my other sister, two sisters were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> with me at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  The families were allowed to meet and talk?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> you had close contact really. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It was permitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">You could talk to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen Belsen</span> , it was much more difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">There was work. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">When I worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> from three o’clock in the morning, I didn’t see anybody, only certain people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">That’s why I left little notes for my wife, just to say what I am doing and what is happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Well, I think that can conclude our discussion about your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Sister Julia Bola
QUESTION:  We are speaking to Mr. Polak about his sister, Julia Bola. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Mr. Polak what can you tell us about Julia? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">When was she born, where was she born, what was she like as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  My sister Julia was a. I would say, a woman with problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I hate to say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Basically she always had emotional problems from early date on. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">She was in a way, she was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">She was smart as all our kids and sometimes being smart doesn’t make it easiest in life, and she suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I think somewhere by the fact that my father favored my younger sister at a later date. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">She was crazy about a young man who she met in the Zionist Movement, and they were engaged and they got married, and they shouldn’t have gotten married because he was as nice and smart a man as he was, he was certainly not the right man for her and she never recognized that. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They fortunately I would say, had no children. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">They were on the forefront of the Zionist Movement in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Both he and she were good speakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">They taught Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Her Hebrew was much better than mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">They were planning to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I don’t recall exactly how and where, but there is a book just out now about all the people who were in the Hav Shara movement in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and her name is mentioned in that book, which made me sure that she was really in the Hav Shara Movement before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">She got married, I think, in 1938, and stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> until July 43. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">They were sent in the same transport as I to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">They also were put on the Palestine list. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">With the <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> list they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Of course being young they were not allowed to go with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Palestine transport</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  What year was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  That was in July 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">She has a terrible time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">She deteriorated fast, she looked terrible when I last saw her, which was, as I recall, only the beginning of April 1945 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We didn’t see each other too much because I worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I do not know anything more than that they both went with the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> in April 11, 1945 leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen Belsen</span> and going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">She was liberated together with me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trovitz</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> and must have died two days after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I learned that only, I would say, one week after I came out of a coma, they didn’t tell me right away, and in fact I do recall that about one week after I came out of the coma they told me that Roosevelt had died and that my sister had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Q Can we go back maybe to, do you know, did she have any interests as a child? </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Did she play any instruments? </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Did you have any pets in the family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  We never had. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Yes, we must have had cats somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I remember something about cats. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">But, basically we were never pet lovers, so I don’t recall at all that we had pets. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We all played an instrument. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">One of the things I do recall 1s notwithstanding the fact that we were poor, my parents always teach us piano or violin, whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I had two years of piano lessons which was a complete waste. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">But, I do recall because somebody in a good family had to learn some instrument. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I don’t remember what my sisters learned, but I’m sure they did too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  Was she friendly, did she have a lot of friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  She was friendly, she had a lot of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Her friends circled around the same friends we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Mostly of the Zionist groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I really was more personally I was more geared to the non-Jewish friends I could get. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Maybe at that time already I felt more I was a member of the basketball club, which had about twenty percent Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Or eighty percent non-Jews then. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Not that it was ever mentioned to us or stated that it was twenty and eighty percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Now I recall at a later date really, you know, I don’t think she went out to the non-Jewish world as much as I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Of course having worked at the <span class="BUILDING">Carlton Hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , it made me also better understand the importance of the non-Jewish world to the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But she circled really around the life of completely Zionist life. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">That was ninety percent of her life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you would like to mention about Julia?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">The only thing I can say is that I do recall that in March 1945, she was very hungry and I had a little piece of bread and she asked me for that piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I never gave it to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Now, if the psychiatrist would examine me he would say you have tremendous guilt thinking about it, and would have the rest of your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I must say in all honesty I felt at that moment that piece of bread could save my life and I didn’t give it to my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But I still think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">It wouldn’t have saved her life anyway, but things like that, you know, stay for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">That was about the last time I saw her. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">One of the horrors of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  Thank you very much for your time. </span>
