<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Could you please tell us a little bit about your earlier life in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and maybe also about any anti-Semitism that you personally experienced or that you witnessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  I experienced a lot of anti-Semitism pretty early on, as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I had very curly, very kinky hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">They called it Juden Haare. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">My brother, who did not have it, didn't have any problem at all, because he had -- he was rather Slavic looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And he could have easily passed for the Hitler youth, while I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And I remember walking out very often having rocks thrown at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">However, I had good German friends whose parents -- I was invited to birthday parties. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">All this stopped around 1934. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Then people got scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">You know, they wouldn't -- I still have pictures of birthday parties where I was invited, and there was -- we had carnival. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We were dressed up in costume and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I have pictures of that with my German friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And that stopped around 1934, '35, because the parents actually got scared, except one. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We had a family living -- we lived in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> , had a big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My parents and my uncle lived with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">There was a family, he was a count. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And they were pretty decent. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I think, if I remember, they did invite us and talked to my parents and didn't greet us with "Heil Hitler". </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But I was more aware -- I don't think I was more aware, but I was anxious not to go to a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> and forced my parents to send me to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> by the simple method -- I was 10 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I drank a whole bottle of castor oil on the day of the exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">That way I don't have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I did not take the exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Because you had to pass an exam to go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> at age 10 for six years. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I went to this <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> , where my grades were very mediocre, except in sports and in socializing. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And I belonged to a Jewish youth group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and we had a great time, because we stayed enclosed, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We were very much protected by our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">As far as possible they protected us. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">However, children realize things that they don't tell their parents either. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We tried to protect our parents, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">My brother was too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I don't remember much. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">He was just a nuisance, as far as I'm concerned, at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  And what do you think that you might have noticed that your parents weren't seeing as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  That were what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  Do you have an example of something you feel that you were noticing that maybe you were saying that you were protecting your parents a little bit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Yes, by not telling them that people attacked me on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I didn't tell them that. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I found another way of going. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I did not tell them that I read Der Sturmer, whichever. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I was an avid reader, in fact, to the extent that I was told by my mother, stop that incessant reading and do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So I bought a Sturmer or I found a Sturmer, and I hid it, and I read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And it was totally the most horrendous thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And as I said, to this day, I cannot understand how a people of so-called literate, cultured people can read pornographic stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">There was somebody in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> , I don't -- I only remember the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">His name was Katzenberger, was accused of Rassenschande because he had a Chekhov girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And what happened to him, I don't know, something rather awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And all of this was in Der Sturmer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Can you talk about your brother a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">My brother was -- he was 3 years younger than I was, very attached to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">To me he was a nuisance, because he read my diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And he was sent to -- I was already in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> when I found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But after the war broke out, they managed to -- my parents managed to get him out to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , where I have my uncle and my aunt and my mother's brother lived and my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">All our relatives were in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> already, the ones who had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And he told me this only later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">He was sent -- he and two other children, ages 12, 11 and 13, he was 12 years old, were put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trieste</span> , where they were supposed to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And when they got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trieste</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I ask him, this is not long ago, a few years ago, what did you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He said, I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">They must have wandered the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trieste</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I don't know what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">After about three or four days, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> came. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">They got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">He told me, nothing -- he has no recollection of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And all of the letters that my parents wrote, he has them. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Now, I have to say, what I do now, as a volunteer, I work for the -- I do translations for the <span class="BUILDING">Leo Baeck Institute</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And presently, I'm also going to have -- I just finished a lot of translations for a pastor minister in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who published pamphlets for small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , what happened for Jews who lived there from the 12th Century on, just background of this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and I translated all of that into English. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">That is what I'm doing at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  That's great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  They asked me to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> next year to see -- for the publication.</span></p>
