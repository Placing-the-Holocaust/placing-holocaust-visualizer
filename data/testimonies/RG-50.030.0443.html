<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Now, I'd like to focus in on the years before, of course, you began with emigration to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">How did you get involved, first of all, in the Zionist movement and specifically with Betar (ph) and revisionist and Zionism. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">You were involved before you began in, before 1937...
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I recall that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  How did you get involved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  I had an uncle Siegmund (ph) Korn (ph), who was a member of the First Zionist Congress in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Betar</span> (ph) and he was a convinced Zionist and interestingly and he explained to me about the Jewish history and about the Jewish building a nation on their own as soon as, who would understand and I was, from the beginning, when I knew that nationally, ethically I am a Jew, was an important issue in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> was the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> and there was a fight for the languages there, between Czech and German, the Jews all held to the <span class="REGION">German side</span> and all spoke German while most of the population spoke Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">But, I was brought up by the incubel (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We had a maid, with whom I spoke only Czech and my parents spoke only Czech with me for the purpose of, that's why Czech is my mother tongue because they said, "German you'll always learn, but you should speak Czech." </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And so I was brought up by the <span class="BUILDING">incubel</span> (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  So how old were you when, this, your uncle, had this effect on you? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Were you still a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  I was four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I don't remember any effect at this time, but I remember that when most of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> started using for drawing pencils, pencils of the Jewish National Fund and he explained it to me what the Jewish National Fund was that it buys land in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and that we will have, that we always had our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> there and that we will have our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> there again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And do you remember anti-semitism growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Yes, I sure do. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I remember shouting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> when I came to the <span class="DLF">playground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I was sometimes asked, I don't know, sometimes, but I remember , where I was asked, "Are you a Jew?" </span><span class="sentence" id="31">and I said, "Yes," and the boy, the student said, "Well we can't play with you," and I asked, "Why?" </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So this boy said, "Because you killed Christ.” </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And I said, "I didn't kill anybody.” </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He said, "Yes, you killed Christ.” </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I said, "No" and then he said, "Then you father did.” </span><span class="sentence" id="36">He was born (ph) insolent. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And then there was when you traveled in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , you, there was a certain habit that if you were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and if there was a with you and you were in <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters compartments</span> that eight people if you traveled third class and that one of them starts out holding his nose and set his teeth, there must be a Jew here. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I remember that this happened once and we left their <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  Now, were your parents also Zionists?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  Yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">They tended towards Zionism, but at the same time they did not know much about Jewish history and but they identified very strongly with Judaism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">When you were a young adult in, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , you went to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , you became a...
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I went first to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , a special <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> that my parents sent me to. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was run by the City of Vienna as a letter-building , a training school for teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And , you are supposed to go five years to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> and then to the <span class="BUILDING">middle school</span> or to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , but you could after four years already miss any particular examinations unless you skip the fifth year as I did (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  At what point did you actually get involved organizationally with a revisionist, with Betar (ph), how old were you, what...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  I was involved at about 16, 17 years of age. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Yes, but I had been before at the Zionist Congress in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carlsbad</span> in about 1920 with my father, nearby in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marinebarton</span> (ph) and I, before all of this was going on in Jewish matters. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">They asked that Jewish be ascribed to and my father told me stories about I was very fascinated as he turned it into stories about what happened to the other 10 tribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , to go ahead to the early 1930's, of course, in January, 1933, Hitler comes to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">How did that affect your Zionist activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Well, you must know I had belonged before to Zionist Student, Student Fraternity, but it was not academic students, it was not yet at a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">It was in a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And it was , but Zionism in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> had a very strong look and national Jewish component, because it was led by Robert (ph) Schlecker (ph), Robert Schlecker was the leader of the Olsten (ph) Jews and he was a good friend of my uncle, Siegmund Korn (ph), because both had been very good student at First Zionist Congress from Bruno (ph) in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moravia</span> and my uncle from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and they continued their contact in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , so I was somehow all this in the group which had student . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Zionism has a very strong local node which was at least as much to us national assistance, assistance of national as Zionism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So, but after Hitler's rise to power...
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  Did you feel, I mean, was your Zionist activities strengthened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  Yeah, but I was before this already very much in the Jewish Student Movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I was in the Jewish Academic Israel, that was one of the corporations which had been Zionist from the beginning of Zionism and I had, yesterday only I got a postcard I think it's not a postcard, I think it is a photocopy of Heffa (ph) in which he writes to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , "To my dear corporation Israel" and to fraternities they are very different to fraternities here. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They are a small group, usually not more than 10 or 12 at the most, would have to be accepted by unanimous vote and I was very much in this fraternity. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">This was a dueling fraternity. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I fought two duels from quite old times (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Here you can still see a little bit, but most of this is gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I fought two duels in my, in my student times. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And this was all very much _ Jewish affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> investigated by the <span class="BUILDING">University of Vienna</span> for having started a riot there. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Which I really did one, once.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  What year was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  That was about 1928 or '29, probably '29. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Every Saturday, the Jewish older fraternities went on a boomer (ph) on the parade (ph) to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> everyone had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they stood and the Jewish students, national fraternities to which the _____ was one, the second oldest, the oldest was Fatima (ph) after whom a saint was recently named, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , then Fatima had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , too, and from time to time the German students, the nationalist fraternity, stood next to us, they started to beat us and to throw us out of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and before this happened every time they sung a certain song and then after they sung it, they kicked us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And once you knew only from the atmosphere that it was to happen before they started the song and once when they were close to starting the song, I then walked up there and said, "I want to speak to your leader" and said, as soon as I came to him, I was brought to him and said I had to leave a message from the Jewish student organizations, bang-then I hit him very hard which, of course, immediately that I was grabbed and beaten and kicked out, but the fight developed in the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and we were all thrown out as we usually were, but at that time it was not that you risked your lives, they just beat you. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Once only at such a riot a man was badly injured and this was the son of Sigmund Freud, Martin Freud was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">He became a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">He was badly injured at one of those fights and I was accused of having starting the riot at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> just so, but the others had started the riots and I usually would not, they would throw us out anyhow, so I started it. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And this is very interesting political , the rector(ph), the do you director, too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Director of the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> , Paxton (ph) Manificos(ph) was exchanged from year to year from one faculty to the other was at that time the initver (ph), the name was I-N-I-T-V-E-R, and he was a theologian. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He was applied by the theologian faculty and he was a priest and he was__ and I told him, "You don't think that I would be crazy to start a fight; how many are we and how many are the others?" </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And of the newspapers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , they are largely in Jewish hands and liberal, very liberal, and they looked out for the chance to hear to have the director of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> who was a theologian and he was then finally called to this panel and he announced that I am being warned. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">That was all. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I could have been excluded from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , because he had told me, I had told him, "You know that you really don't start this" and he said," __I don't know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Well, he was very mild (ph) and the journalists were waiting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for me to come out with accusations toward the Director and I told them he was a nice man, he has a very liberal attitude so this makes a nice story, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So they had a big story that a priest who is not radical and who is most pleasant sort and had very good press and shortly after that the Olsten (ph) party formed a coalition to look for a Minister of Social Welfare and they got him because he was accepted to the <span class="BUILDING">liberal school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I think this has something to do with my, with my ___ until I was mentioned by the | and he became Minister of Social Welfare and he was one of the Olsten Provision (ph) government and then they told the Cardinal of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> died and he was well-liked by everybody, that they made him, the Pope made him Cardinal for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , but he behaved very badly, well, the, the Nazis came in and he was the first one to turn to the Nazis and publish a poster, "Heil Hitler," which he agreed very much with the regime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Let me ask you, during these early years, did you at any time think of settling in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  The event (ph), which is just what I wanted to emphasize, Zionism was very much of a national minority that is you of it, primary understanding for national minority, so the Jews were very Satisfied that the League of Nations had adopted a law for protection of minorities and this vision was that the Viennese Jews in their mass (ph) were least protected by these Jews very conscious of their Jewish culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  So, how specifically did you get involved specifically with the Betar movement and revisionism, which is obviously a very logical specific type of Zionism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  There was at this time a discussion going on whether the Jewish, whether Zionism was really a state or was it a strong movement that we want a bi-national unit at the time and those people, and I knew about it and I was always radical. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I was for the state and by then I went into the Congress, I went for the first time in 1935 to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> when I was...1935, I was 29 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but before this 1935 I went to the Congress in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Aisha (ph) was a friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And then I heard Gobutinski's (ph) speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But I heard him, then I formally joined, like I had heard him already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Catovitz</span> (ph), which was a revisionist a few years before this, as I was very much impressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He was a most impressive personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I knew him well. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">A book came out recently by Shotz (ph) in manages very permanently (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  What was it about Gobutinski that impressed you, that type of Zionism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  No, it was not only the Zionism, 1t was the personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">He was an excellent orator and then he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Everybody went to hear him. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">He didn't advertise what he's talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They had a big placard that said, "Gobutinski's Speech", "Gobutinski .’ </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And that was enough to have people come there. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And he is not only, I don't think he could give it a specific name. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Half of Zionism seems (ph) one and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  Did your activities intensify between...after 1933? </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I mean you were very active well before 1933, but then, when Hitler came to power, at the time did you see that as a seminal event at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  I don't remember what I thought at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But I was very active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> has been a assimilical (ph) community with the old people coming to well- to-do Jews who are running it and after that . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Many not-well-to-do poor Jews from the East came in as refugees from the Russian advance and they formed the majority finally of the Viennese Jews and I was active in the viacom (ph) in the fight, in the fight, for getting elected into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was something entirely different than it 1s here or anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">By law, incorporation to which every Jew belongs whether they wanted to or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And to put, they tax you. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">If you didn't pay your tax to the Jewish community, the tax of the government taxed your property. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">They had very officious tactics, this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">There was only one way to get out, to declare ousted (ph) of the ; "I don't want to be a Jew any more," and you were not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was really direct presentation of the Jews and I was very active for, for the Zionists, for Zionists who finally got the majority.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Now when did you begin to, with the issue of emigration what was termed illegal emigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">How did you arrive at that as a solution? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">How did you come to that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  When Hitler came to power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the refugees come over from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , mainly well-to-do people, and they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and their children sometimes had the desire to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and they couldn't get visas, certificates from Betar (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="126">The Betar (ph) was the strongest Jewish organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and you couldn't get any number of certificates . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">You know emigration was very limited by ability and the people of the leftist organization, of the liberal group, they got most of the certificates, but the Betar didn't get enough certificates. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">so one day I was in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> just as I described here, I was a lawyer, and a man came in and said, "I have a message from Dr. Wolfgang , who was a Viennese Zionist from an old Vienna family, a nobility, which was very rare for Jews and his message was, "Bill, Willy, listen to this man, he has something interesting to say", and he suggested that we, he said I have some contact with...he was a Palestinian Jewish Patriot Adventurer, he was a real adventurer, and he said that I have contact with underground in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> and I suggested following it, rent a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> from these people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  This is 1937?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  This was 1936, that we...could have been '35. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">That we rent a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> from them and put our batterime (ph) on it and for people who really want to emigrate and on the way to supposedly going to the <span class="BUILDING">Vierra De Tripoli</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We really wanted them to be as a very rich and well-to-do, a center of power, a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> should be run (ph) and there was much propaganda to go to the Vierra De Tripoli (ph) and he said, "We ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to go to the Vierra De Tripoli (ph)?" </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But if we don't come to the Vierra De Tripoli, it was only the batterime (ph) will force the _ to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> instead and there will be a big stinking develop because Jews from good <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that pilot the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and go to...
QUESTION:  You wanted the publicity...
ANSWER:  We wanted the publicity in order to point out to the world that in spite of the need to, a <span class="REGION">land</span> to go to, in spite of what the League of Nations has decided on the strength of that this should be a Jewish nation alone, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , that this is not being done. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And..
QUESTION:  Was this successful?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  This is what was suggested to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">His name was Shriebelstein (ph) G-R-I-V-O-L-H-E-I-N (ph) Moshe Grivolhein, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Galinin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">He changed his to Galinin (ph), and I saw a different _._I said, "This propaganda is very good, but we can do better. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We can bring the people in and try to smuggle (ph) them in." </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He said there would be no problem with the because the problem being in the of this , So try to smuggle (ph) them in but you're going to help us to smuggle them in and we'll smuggle them in once, twice, three times until they catch us; then we will have the publicity, and in the meanwhile, __ you people into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And he agreed to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">This is when we started organizing the first two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> ; we did not get enough people to go with the first one, the people were scared to go...
QUESTION:  So you had to convince people to...
ANSWER:  Well, I was a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I would be able to smuggle them. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">There was not so much need yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And so I traveled to <span class="REGION">Eastern Slovakia</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Topachkarusha</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> (ph) it was called, it was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and there the policy was very great about the Jews and from there you go up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tareem</span> (ph) to some I think only two or three batterime (ph) from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> of the first 16 people, 15 or 16 that had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , I have the number here, which to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Independent of this, which I did not know that Gobutinski had called at one of his articles for breakings of the rules of the British persuasions and to make illegal propaganda and to make it a Jewish spot, but it was already, it had happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  What part did they leave from in Europe?</span></p>

"</span><span class="sentence" id="248">There was once in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , a very well-known patriot, a Marquis who was very patriotic every time the Marciess (ph) was played, or sung, he got up, whatever the conditions and saluted (ph) and one night burglars broke into his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he reached for his pistol under his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> and while he, but when as soon as they started, one of them jumped to the spinet and started to play the Marciess (ph) and this Marquis was standing in his nightgown in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , saluting, while burglars robbed him of everything he had. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">What was this man? </span><span class="sentence" id="250">He said, "Marciess (ph) or the storyteller.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="251">The Marciess is whole (ph) but this man was an idiot!" </span><span class="sentence" id="252">It doesn't have a lot to do with holocaust, but it tells you a little bit about what type of personality Gobutinski was and, of course, ,
QUESTION:  So you say the primary concern then was not trying to regain equality but getting Jews out of Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Yes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  I read this memorandum, I told him I would give him a memorandum and I made out a memorandum which I had to translate into English because the German is so poor I had a carbon copy of it, but the carbon copy is not so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I think I gave a carbon copy before to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">But it 1s very poor, it is hardly legible, and I am now about to translate it, it 1s three pages long and so at the beginning of the second page it is dear to us and making the Germans understand that this 1s not really doing something very illegal _—_—. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Of course, it was illegal, but this memorandum by _ about, I didn't hear from him, about 10 days later, which I don't know whether it was 10 days, my feeling today is I was sitting in, I was sitting in the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">anteroom</span> to the president of the of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and Eichmann was one of his bodyguards which came in and Martin (ph) complained that he saw me sitting there and he pointed me and said, "Oh Cesar (ph) assume Oh Cesar (ph) ", which is actually nothing will be with it, because we do not want to censor a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for criminality in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">The Jews have to be autobon (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="261">At this time, autobon (ph) did mean destroyed into many pieces, into atoms.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  So, what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  I was . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to complain about Eichmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">He was crazy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  Did you, at the time, think you were crazy or were you confident?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  No, I knew that I have to overcome him, but only three more minutes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> I changed my plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I will not complain about him, but will try to make it appear that I am upset by him. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">If they find out, they find out, but the chance that I survive if the plan survived is better than if I say and complain about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  So...
ANSWER:  And I went to see Dr. Kareski (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Kareski was a lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> who was a Revisionist and he told me, "You are crazy to complain, the second plans are (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="274">He said, "What do you need from here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I think I need permission from the Gestapo to go ahead with the emigration. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">He said, what do you, I need the Gestapo Eichmann to, not to get special permission but to permit that we do it because the Jewish couldn't do anything without permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Well, of the Gestapo to organize the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and the German lawyer was very practical and said, "You need foreign currency, too?" </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I said, "Of course, I do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="279">He said, "If you put anywhere, put it all in one foreign currency.” </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So I went the next day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> where the conditions are still much better than in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> because in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> the percentage of Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was much smaller than in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was 10 percent Jews in very leading positions. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">A large percentage of the lawyers, of the doctors, of the physicians were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So, much less anti-semitism and much Nazism going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> than in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> a few days after the Aunschluss, but all <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was happy Vienna return of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> has never been part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> has been part of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="286">ANSWER:  I don't know his name, but I know, you see, I went to the Ministry of Economics, used to be Ministry, to get permission to use for the emigration foreign currency. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And I did not know anybody there so I went in and I said...there was a guard, an armed guard, and he asked, "What do you want?" </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And I told him, "I want to see Mr. So-and-So.” </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I think I asked him to give me a name, but I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I don't think I knew any names and we went into this , this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> which went up all the time anymore and to some <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and I went out and I looked at the sign and I didn't know to look for a certain name and somebody with an impressive title, but went in with two of his favorshein (ph) and told him we had been sent from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in regards to the emigration of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">It was very important and he listened to me very attentively and said, "It is very interesting, but I have nothing to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">See Mr. So- and-So." </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So I went to Mr. So-and-So and told him, "Mr. So-and-So, there was already somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">They sent me to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We are sent from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and we are sent by the authorities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , not by the Betar (ph)." </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And he listened and said, "I have nothing to do with it." </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But, I said, "Who has to do with it, with the foreign currency?" </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Oh, he sent me to the right man and I repeated it for a third time the story and he was impressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Everyone wanted to get rid of the Jews since I made it clear the situation had changed completely with of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and there is I say a memorandum too. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And he said, "Let me have a memorandum.” </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And I made the memorandum which I asked for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and made a few adjustments I had it typed and it describes <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> where and went back to them and give it to them on the first day it was and two days later, or three days later, I got the permission for 2,000 people, 12 pounds in foreign currency. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We originally and we now started to tell the people, "Get your passports.” </span><span class="sentence" id="304">The Battartme (ph) started to get their passports and the word soon spread that you can go with the Betar (ph) with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Paragon</span> (ph) which they were soon called, because on the <span class="DLF">door</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of my lawyers was written, Dr. Willy Perle, _ transport and people came in and one day shortly after apparently a neighbor had reported some suspicious looking men or Jews meeting there and the police came and raided us. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And I showed them the permits from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">This way Eichmann learned, Eichmann learned that I had the permission from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and he shut up. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">He did not know more. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And from this moment on, he played along very nicely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  So he wasn't angry at you, that you sort of went around his back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  He did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">He did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I don't think he knew how I worked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">He just knew that the police had raided our <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and that we had the permission from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> with currency even from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">He didn't, the German proverb, "If you have a boot on your head you don't go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sun</span> ; if you boot (ph) on your head, you don't go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sun</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="315">He had been overruled. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And he didn't want to see our trouble, I believe, so he went along with it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="953">ANSWER:  Or how I got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Well, after this I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , then I was released, and was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And then on the day the war broke out, I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Orient Express</span> and traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="956">This was very unlikely that I could travel so freely with the Jew passport that | have. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">But I had arranged for to get a British entrance visa, which was the very high, highly valued. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And everybody knew <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , the <span class="COUNTRY">USA</span> is in with <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , so everybody tried to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And I had gone in, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> (ph), where the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> of course knew of my activities for the <span class="BUILDING">British Embassy</span> , through the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> to get the visa, which seems impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And I said I want to speak to the Ambassador. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And the guy asked, "What is it about?" </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I said, "About my intention which I will speak about only to the Ambassador." </span><span class="sentence" id="963">So the Ambassador didn't come, but the secretary of his came, and I told him, "I want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> because I want to organize there. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Just need money for the transport as I can do it on a larger scale." </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Of course I would have been arrested right away in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">So they tried to catch me by giving me a visa to <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and to writing already on the visa, it was written, for recreation. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">For recreation, that was underlined. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">So that they don't have to prove anything legally, that I was there for recreation. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">If I wasn't there for this, like these other things, that they could arrest me. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">With this British visa, but with the other 1 was transit visas all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I could travel from there to, from actually , from <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> via <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , via <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , and <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="973">The war was on and I continued organizing and I organized there. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Then the largest transport ever of any group, it was . </span><span class="sentence" id="975">At least 2,300 and some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">I organized this from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , together with Dr. Ruben Heitz (ph), whom you probably know by name. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> I was arrested again. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> and was again arrested in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> because things had been figured out for me, and was deported to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> and from the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> I flew to <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> I went from there, from <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , to continue the illegal transports. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">illegal transports equal to via the Mediterranean from <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="981">But I couldn't because then I was , for the first or second time, into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port of Lisbon</span> in order to negotiate which <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> owners would be agreeable to going to this business. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">There were no Greeks there. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">A man came to me and while I was in the <span class="DLF">docks</span> looking for a pair of sunglasses, I turned and he was standing next to me and said, "Dr. Perl, if you show yourself just once more in the Port here, we will have you arrested and deported back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Now this was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Then I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , they couldn't get a visa anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">Then there was a rumor that you can get visas to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and I went and got the visa to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="987">Of course, knowing that the visa exists means nothing because you had to go to a at that time and I was, I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , which was to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lorenzo-Marches</span>

to get a visa to, try to get a visa to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , which was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">But what is interesting, for the whole story of the Holocaust is, that 1t was impossible to get an American visa anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">This <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> landed the first time on the island of San Tome' (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="990">This was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freighter</span> , ; <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Tome</span> ' (ph), the name was Mun-din-o (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="991">And there I went to ask for an American visa and this man had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Tome'</span> (ph), he had figures, numbers for entrance into <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="992">Who, what Jew, , a little island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Tome</span> ' (ph) asked for everything possible to keep the Jews out. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And I sailed to <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , to shorten the story, in <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> there was a very friendly <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> who sold me American, I should go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Er, to <span class="COUNTRY">Mozambique</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Who sold me <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I should go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="996">I could not go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="997">I wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">Back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was an older man, an industrialists from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And he told me keep out from the time is not good because you have to get, if you want to get from <span class="REGION">Africa</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> you have to row by a and the British will get you there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">If they will get you, they will get you in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and there you will be busy and , Important, time and effort trying to get you out so you keep out from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">So I decided to go really not to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">This man gave me the visa to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1103">ANSWER:  I was interrogating prisoners for whom certain information was desired. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Especially I was charged with specific information, there were four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">interrogation teams</span> , MFIU (Mobile Field Interrogation Units). </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">This belongs to, we're not attached to any Army, we were attached but didn't belong, we were not under the of command. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">We were directly in command from the <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters</span> and . </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And I was at least one of those, and I use to interrogate prisoners who were of interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">Before we had many prisoners, we interviewed them for broadcasting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">We already know what should go into our propaganda broadcast. . </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">This deal had question marks, questionnaires. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">But in life this is not a game so they didn't have to sign it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">Who is best liked in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">Who is least liked? </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">So that we called American propaganda could concentrate on the least liked ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And then concentrate for example on Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">Everybody loves Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Hitler was, you couldn't say anything about Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">But was the most , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Until after a number of questionnaires were to the intelligence services I didn't always know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">And this is what I did until about the beginning of September, or late in August, when we already had in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , not in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they had settled the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German town</span> , which the name of it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pirl</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">I never knew of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">When I was transferred at my request from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to the mainland. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And I was in this military intelligence on the mainland until I took out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1126">QUESTION:  Now at what point after the war's end, or maybe before, I don't know, did 1t become clear to you what really had happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">The extent of the Final Solution?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1128">ANSWER:  All this became clear to me as soon as I started interrogating prisoners of rank and all the trials in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And I was assigned there to assist the combined services, detailed to which was the highest level interrogation center for the allied army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">All the allied armies had representatives there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">The Dutch and the <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and the Australians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And I was there as an American representative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">And there I heard for the first time, one of the first prisoners who told me about it told me about the gassing in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">That they took people into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> , gassed the people, he had worked on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">He said he didn't, but I got information from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">I was not allowed to arrest him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">I wanted information about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">So in turn I heard from others who had seen mass shootings in the east, but none of them knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1141">QUESTION:  At the war's end, did you know or have knowledge of whether Mrs. Perl was alive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1142">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">I knew that she had been arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">I knew that she had been arrested just before, she had to be arrested because she is when she wants to do something ideally she will do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And I knew that she would hide people, which she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">And that she wouldn't be very careful about it I knew too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And besides this she wrote me a letter, that she had visitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">She was for a few days gone and she had visitors, when she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> she had visitors from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Puno</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1149"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Puno</span> (ph) was the capital of who was a communist and was arrested among the first ones in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">And so here, in both <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , so <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Puno</span> (ph) was the keyword to us for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">And she said, all Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">She will visit us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Puno</span> (ph), or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">So I knew that she, that she was not arrested, she was only brought to the Gestapo, she talked there three hours, but she continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And then when they arrested her and brought her to the Rounds-berg (ph) concentration camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">But I knew at the time in which we are talking about now, or at the end of the war, I knew that she was in, must have been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">I knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> there, I knew about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Not the details but I knew that there are mass murders there and I wondering, I worried that she is alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1158">QUESTION:  How did you find out that she in fact was alive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1159">ANSWER:  Well, that's a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">The other commanding officer, we were all European Jews in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">unit</span> , this was specialized concentrated on important information which was expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">very cleverly assigned a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">My job was, at one time, to find out whether, if you chased allies armies approach and uprisings of the against the Nazis and they would be expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">I found out, I knew this from the beginning, that there was to be no uprising because they were much too clever for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">Yeah.</span></p>

ANSWER: ... nan hour I got her into the...
QUESTION:  There is something you ought to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1189">ANSWER:  It was fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">It was like in a movie which I never saw, we foresee that, and imagine, it was dark already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">And in the light of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> you saw these Russians, not the, the Russian horses, small horses, these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">They went back with little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and pulled us into <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">They had taken this, and with them came the Russian Flea Circus, who had been brought by the Germans to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">And this Flea Circus had robbed the Germans of everything they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">I didn't mind that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">There was the women, they are sitting next to the driver of the horses, and there are dressed in fantastic ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">They had stolen or robbed the Germans, the drapes, and sewed these gowns and they were wrapped into this, green and red and blue, shiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">It was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">And then it was again after we passed, it was pitch dark and we ran into a <span class="DLF">hole</span> , there was a <span class="DLF">bump hole</span> , and we came to a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> where you couldn't cross, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And this trip was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">Of course, for her it was the first . </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">Where I said . </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">sure now we got into <span class="REGION">American territory</span> because she had no paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">I filled out, I had a paper that said she has been arrested as a . </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">And as the beckoned, I changed the , She sat in some <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with some German family where I arrived at night and we stayed all night until early in the morning I came and reported to the Major that I brought my wife back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">He was horrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">It was a time where every contact with any lower citizen who was not American, with any lower citizen was strictly forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">It was very taboo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">Which was idiotic because you couldn't speak to your parents who might still be alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">But he was horrified about it and he was scion of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , a very rich, very well known family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">This was about all he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And he called the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of intelligence, I assume, and said what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">Because earlier we were afraid of political complications with the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And so he says, "You proceed now to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Batch-schwiber</span> (ph), this is of course the <span class="BUILDING">military intelligence headquarters</span> for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and report there to so-and-so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And I took Laura (ph) into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and instead of going to , She was quite sick, she was, looked like a skeleton. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">And brought her to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">Which disappointed her, and continued to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Batch-schwiber</span> (ph) and there I was seen by the General, who said, "What is this, it is horrible what you did, Perl." </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">I said, "Yes I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">But you have to know the story." </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">I told him the story and then he says, "What should I do with you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">I says, "Sir, wait a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">Sir, what would you have done in my <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">So he think for a second and he says, "Hell I would have done the same." </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">And he said, "Is it all right with you if I transfer you to another unit and out of military intelligence because this is too much for intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">To another unit and take you off the promotion list?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">There was a listing where I was to be promoted to First Lieutenant from Second Lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">I said, "Fine." </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I was promoted three weeks later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">So I was then offered this, and I was then transferred to war crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">You see, most people ridicule the army because they will send people in the wrong <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">I was always in the military in the right <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">I was in intelligence when it was really important to be in intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">And when the war was over I was transferred to the war crimes, and I was from then on in war crimes until my discharge from the army in December, 1946.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1234">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">I want to ask you in a minute about the war crimes, but just one other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">You found Mrs. Perl, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">Were you in any way trying to look for relatives, friends, Jewish friends who you thought might have perished during the Holocaust? </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">Your, people who were a part of your life before you came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">Did you know where they were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1240">ANSWER:  I knew this, they were all gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">The is to succeed to get out alive, but there were no known Jews to be left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1242">QUESTION:  What happened to your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1243">ANSWER:  My brother? </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">He went with the first larger transport to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">But most of my relatives went with those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> but some didn't want to take the risk of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and they perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">I had about fourteen relatives, including cousins, first cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">If I go farther it would be more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">Fourteen people who were murdered by the Germans.</span></p>
