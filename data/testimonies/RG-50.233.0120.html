<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  My name is Charlene Schiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , December 16, 1929.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Can you tell me your name then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Yeah, my Hebrew name was Sulamit Perlmutter and my nickname was Musia.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Musch?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  No, Musia.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Oh, Musia, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">That’s right outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  It’s about an hour’s drive from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">It’s a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about growing up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Yes, I can tell you all my wonderful memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I had an idyllic childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I was surrounded by love. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I had two wonderful parents and one older sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">She was four years older than I. We had a very good relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My parents were both educators. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">My father was a university professor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  What was your father’s name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Simeon. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Simcha, Simeon, Simeon Perlmutter, Simeon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  And he was a university professor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">That was a <span class="BUILDING">state university</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  What did he teach?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Philosophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My mother did mot teach but both of them were civic leaders in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I would like to bring out the fact that they were leaders not just for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> but for the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">What hurts so now in retrospect is that when we needed help no one extended a helping hand to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Our neighbors and former so-called friends turned against us. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">My childhood was very, very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I know my father had five sisters and a mother who emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and he was in I guess, in the process of arranging for us to join them in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> when the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I don’t know why he was the last one to emigrate but I understand from -- also 1n retrospect that it was because these were women, sisters, and he decided he would take care of them first even though he was somehow in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I don’t know the actual chronological years but unfortunately we never made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Ironically in 1939 he was offered two tickets, two invitations to the World’s Fair in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and he refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">He asked for four and of course they didn’t give him four so we never did make it or he never made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My childhood was very, very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I remember a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was always filled with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">In those days or at that time we’d have like meetings and concerts, poetry reading.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  At your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Yeah and all these many students of his would come and it was a very happy <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I think that’s what gave me strength to survive in a way because I did have a very solid background of love and security.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  When did you start going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Well, my father was a believer in education, obviously, and we had tutors from the time I was four years of age and that’s when we started and then I guess to regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I started at around six.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  You went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Yes, I went to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> but we still had private tutors for Latin and for German and piano music.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  So you knew four languages then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  No I really didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I was not a student. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I was more of a tomboy. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">My sister was very musically inclined. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">She played the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , she played the violin beautifully and she continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I played the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> but I really didn’t give it any of my soul or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I liked to play and run around and just do the normal things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  You said you were a tomboy. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">What did you mean by that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Oh I would climb <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and do that sort of stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was there a lot of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lakes</span> and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">streams</span> and things to play with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  No, there was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and I remember once, as a matter of fact on my fourth birthday there was a party and at that time, it’s very hazy, but we did not live in a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the fashionable <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">My father and I walked along the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , on the banks of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> played a very important role in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I looked over to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and I said, Papa is that <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and he tried to explain that it was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">There was one <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">There were two <span class="DLF">ponds</span> and there was a great big, it’s not a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> -- what do you call -- like a <span class="DLF">park</span> but filled with <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and all and that <span class="DLF">park</span> or on the edge of the <span class="DLF">park</span> lived a lady who owned an awful lot of <span class="REGION">land</span> and she was the, like the (I don’t know what you would call it -- the word escapes me now) but she was from nobility, Polish nobility and she was like a princess. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And she lived, she was an old lady at that time; she only had some servants and all who tended her. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But she lived right on the edge of that great big <span class="DLF">park</span> and it was like a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And then we had like a <span class="BUILDING">mayor’s house</span> , the Starosta and all these people used to come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the mayor, the Polish priest and the Ukrainian priest because our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was partly Polish and partly Ukrainian and partly Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">In our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> everyone met on an even status and it was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I mean I took it for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">My friends were Polish, Ukrainian, Jewish, and I really even though you’re not asking me, I never felt any anti-Semitism in my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">There probably was some but I never felt it personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And when I think of it now it was probably no small achievement that my father was a professor at a <span class="BUILDING">state university</span> as a Jew and to me it was a given. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">That’s the way it went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">My mother did an awful lot of philanthropic work in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I remember they organized <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in the summer time for needy children, Polish, Jewish, Ukrainian and there was always an awful lot of activity and it was a very happy <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I mean there were many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">You talk about being a tomboy. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I was the bane of my sister’s existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">She was four years older and I always wanted to do what she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Of course she resented it. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">One time we had they call it a fretepian so it’s not really a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> I guess but something like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> in a <span class="INT_SPACE">salon</span> , in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">One time I got hold of some paint and I painted the keys. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I was punished for that but I did it so she wouldn’t be able to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Those are the things I remember from my childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  How large was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> approximately?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Twenty, thirty thousand, just about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  So it was a good size <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">It wasn’t a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , yeah, but it was a very typical <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> as they call it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Was there a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Yes very large and very active, large, I don’t know probably several thousand Jews and there was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish day school</span> they called *Tarbut and there was a society, I guess, the Kahila that governed the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">There were several different <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">There was a rabbi and that’s it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Were your parents religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  They were traditional but they were quote emancipated unquote. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They were not very religious, they were traditional. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I knew who I was, I knew my identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We observed all the holidays and that’s another thing I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Once before Passover I was given a little Star of David and a gold chain and I lost the Star of David and there were about twenty people at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and this is like a big dinner at Passover and everybody was made to crawl on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> to find my little Star of David which they found. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But I don’t remember going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> every Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">No, we didn’t do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about -- you know as much as you can remember -- about the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> by the Germans in 1939?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Well before the Germans invaded my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> the Soviet Union took over because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was partitioned in two. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">The eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> became the property of the Soviet Union and we fell into that category. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So in 1939 when the war started September 1, 1939, the Russians came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They came in with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and with their soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Did they come in on the first or did they come in a few weeks later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  They came in maybe a week or so later and I remember long, long processions. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">At that time we lived in a big, big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on the main fashionable <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Litsa Miskawicha and I remember long hordes of refugees coming from the other part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> trying to get away from the Germans and we didn’t understand what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">They came in with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and with soldiers but very little bloodshed. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">There was a lot of chaos but pretty soon things became again sort of normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I personally did not realize what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I knew there was a change of government. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">The emphasis in my life was that the language, the formal language became Russian instead of Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But again that was not much of a problem because in our <span class="REGION">area</span> everyone was either bi or tri-lingual. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It was a little difficult in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">A lot of people lost their jobs and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">My father did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">They kept him on and he continued in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">There was one change which I just realized a few days ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">He used to also teach in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kracow</span> , I don’t what do you call it, as a visiting professor and that stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Well it stopped obviously because the Germans took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But other than that our life did not change that much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  You stayed in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  We stayed in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">You see we were not materialistically, we were not rich or we were not -- I guess my family was part of the intellectual group in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> so our life has not changed much. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">This went on for not quite two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Our <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> didn’t lose a beat. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">The only thing is that the official language changed into Russian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Were you taught Russian in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  And were the businesses in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> nationalized, that kind of thing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  Well you know what was happening and again this is all in retrospect which I didn’t realize. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Some people would disappear in the middle of the night and not be heard from again. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And these were probably the people that they considered capitalists. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">These were business people who owned businesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Yes, I guess the businesses changed hands so to speak and all of a sudden there was a shortage of one item, two items, three items. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Yes, definitely, the whole picture of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> did change.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Can I back up just a little bit before the invasion? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Do you remember your father, your family in general being concerned about the Germans coming to power, the Nazis coming to power and becoming more powerful?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Well, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">This was not discussed in front of me but I know my father had a fantastic <span class="BUILDING">library</span> in his little <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and now and again they would have meetings and they closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">A lot of people would come, a lot of his students and they would talk and then I would never see them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And then I found that a lot of them emigrated in a clandestine way illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And a lot of them ended up, many as a matter of fact, ended up in what is now <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and some of them ended up in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And some of them we never heard of again. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But yes, there were many discussions and there were concerns.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Now you said something about earlier when we spoke about trying to get out and go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> your father.....
ANSWER:  Yes, my father.....
QUESTION:  When did he try to do this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Well, it seems like all my life there was talk about it but I know that at one point, I don’t know exactly, I think it was 1938, we all had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and be interviewed or something and this was part of the process of getting ready to emigrate to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  But the papers just didn’t come through before the invasion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  I don’t know what happened but apparently so, unfortunately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Was there anything, you know you talked about your life under the Soviets when they came in, I there anything else that strikes you about the Soviet rule about anything that you could remember that was very striking to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  Well, I guess going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was a little more -- I mean it became less frequent. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">It didn’t affect any of my immediate friends so I am very hazy about it and I know that it was difficult and I know that they probably nationalized the businesses and all but from my own personal point of view I cannot relate to it too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  You made mention about the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Was there a conscious effort by the authorities to discourage religious practices?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  I don’t know, I’m sure it was but it was done in a very subtle way and I think my father was conscious of it and probably cognizant of it that he is not supposed to go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> too often.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  You said he was allowed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Do you remember if he was allowed to travel freely in that way back or forth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Yeah, he was traveling back and forth but I don’t think we traveled anyplace else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Why don’t you tell me a little bit about when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  Well, that happened in the summer of 41. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Again I guess Hitler and Stalin, or Hitler decided to break his agreement with Stalin and he started pursuing his evil plans by occupying the territories first of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and then going on to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The Germans came, again it’s almost like out of nowhere, again with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and their soldiers were much -- they were dressed sharp, they looked sharp. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">To me it was an event of change, but in a way exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It’s hard to say that but it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">They came in and we didn’t know what to expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I know my parents were very depressed but they did not share these feelings with us openly. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Again we saw a lot of refugees, as we call them now, people going with the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Why we didn’t do it, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I’m sure it’s very difficult to make decisions like these when you have a family, when you’re on your own. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I want to track back and I think that my father was an ardent Zionist and I think that we didn’t go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for two reasons and this is my conjecture. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">One, the authorities and the red tape was absolutely awful and took a long time and secondly my father’s heart really didn’t belong there and yet being a family man with two kids it was difficult for him to make a decision to do what he told his students to do and a lot of them did then. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Do you think he was advocating for many of them to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Oh, I know he did because we made a trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1985 (decade is unclear) or so and I met some of his students. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">They organized an evening to honor the memory of my parents, especially my father, their mentor, and they told me that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  Did they remember you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  Yes, they remembered me as a little pain in the neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Yes, they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And I remembered some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Yes, my father was really an ardent Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I didn’t realize then, I didn’t know that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  Did you know much of his activities in that vein?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  No, I know he was preoccupied with education and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">He had a number of doctorates from different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and that was his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">But the rest of it, no, I did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">He was a wonderful father, he was very stern. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">There was discipline. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">We did not speak at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> until he spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But that was all right, we didn’t know any different so that was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I think I digressed from something that you asked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  No, that’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We can get back to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I’ve got a couple of other questions but I wanted to step back just a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I asked you about the invasion, the German invasion, but I wanted to step back just a little bit if I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Before when we talked about how your father had discussions with students and other people about Germans, the Nazis coming to power and that kind of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  Yes, I think so because there were all sorts of newspapers and the radios and the political situation was discussed constantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  Do you, now this is an interesting question because many people at the time especially historians speculate that some people in the Soviet Union may not have known or tried to play down the fact that the Germans were going to invade. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Do you remember if your father was concerned about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I think he was always concerned with the world situation and they always, I mean at these discussions and these gatherings political situations were always discussed whether it was a concert or poetry reading or so but yes it was always discussed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  When the invasion happened in June of 41 do you remember how long it was after the invasion started that the Germans came into your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or arrive in the <span class="REGION">area</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  I would say within a week, not any longer than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">There was no bloodshed or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They just came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">In the very beginning, I don’t know if it was the same day they marched in or the next day, all the Jews, right away they zeroed in on the Jews, we had to meet at the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> and right away they started with their decrees to strip us of all material possessions slowly but very systematically. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">The first request was for the Jews to give all the gold, maybe all the silver, all the radios, everything that had any material value, carpets, Persian carpets, you wouldn’t imagine, furs, fur coats, all sorts of things we had to bring to the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> , or whatever, I think it was the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> , the Germans took that. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And that went on for about a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Then they went around with a list of people which tells me that the local inhabitants had to give them that list.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  Somebody had to give them that list.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">They didn’t know the names and they went for specific men. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">These men were all the leaders, the Jewish leaders in the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And of course my father was one of them and they took him away. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Just like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">QUESTION:  And that was within the first week of them being there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  Within the first week or maybe the very beginning of the second week, that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">There was so much chaos and so much confusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">I don’t recall but every day since the Germans came in was just like a nightmare in the beginning and that was not even the real nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">But that’s the way I lost my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">He saw them; he tried to run out through the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , through the back way and they were in the back there with the Ukrainians and they grabbed him and that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">The rumor had it that these people, the leaders of our community were taken away and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Now I find out that there was a big question mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Some people told me that it’s probable that they were all executed right there and there’s supposed to be a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> which I never got to see upon my return trip in 1988. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Or some of them did go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I searched in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> for any sign, lists and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I could not find anything and I still to this day, I do not know how or when my father died. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">After they took away the leaders of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which was a very organized plan to just cause chaos and confusion once the leaders were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Then they, I don’t know the sequence, the chronological sequence, but they burnt all our <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and they gathered, we had to be there to watch it, every Jewish person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  ...was taken out to watch it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  ..to watch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They burned all our books of prayer, our Torahs, everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And they did that in one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Then we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Everyone who was fourteen years or older was ordered to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">In the morning they would gather in a certain <span class="NPIP">place</span> , my sister and my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I mean it was such a stupid, useless....most of the work was useless. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">My mother was digging <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">My sister at that point was also digging ditches. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Then, after a little while, every day there were different decrees and different orders, loudspeakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was organized, one day a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> pulled up in front of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and several Germans came out and they came up to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and asked where my father’s <span class="BUILDING">library</span> was and my father had a rare collection of first edition books and I mean that was his life’s hobby (all the little money we had I think he spent on the rare books) and they knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">How did they know about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Somebody told them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  And these were Germans who came?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  Germans, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And they cleaned out his <span class="BUILDING">library</span> which was stacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">My father’s <span class="BUILDING">library</span> was a place where we had to wash our hands to go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">We were not allowed to touch the books without his permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">He really had a fantastic collection. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">But anyway they took it all, packed it in boxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  This was after he had been taken way’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Yes, that was after he had been taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And they gave my mother a receipt. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">They thanked the gnaidika frau. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">They thanked her yet and they drive off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">QUESTION:  At this point in time not long after the invasion do you remember if there was a differentiation between what we might call like German soldiers and maybe Nazi troops, that kind of thing? </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Do you remember that at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  They were just German soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  They were just Germans to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  Do you remember when the Germans actually came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , were there people who were happy to see them and not just because they were fascists but maybe against the communists or that kind..?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  Oh yes, they were greeting them with flowers, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  There were a lot of people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> doing this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  Oh yes, they were lining the <span class="DLF">streets</span> with flowers and applauding, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Then after another few days there was an announcement in the middle of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">That day nobody went to work because every day my sister and my mother were told to meet at six o’clock in the morning to go to work and they would be herded back in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">That day no work. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I don’t remember but in the morning, maybe ten or eleven o’clock there were loudspeakers going around and announcing the fact that we have to meet in the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> within an hour and we can take with us what we want to take, what we can carry with us and that’s what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We grabbed whatever we could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you took?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  Yes, I remember what I took. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I also remember that my mother had enough foresight that we had some gold coins and a few rings. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I mean not much because we were not a family that was very materialistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">But she sewed into our clothing and to each my sister and myself and her own clothing some of the jewelry into the linings. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">She said you never know. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">This is for a rainy day. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And so we grabbed the clothing, the coats and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I don’t remember what else we grabbed but some pillows and blankets and we went to the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  And that was in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  Yes, and there we were marched into a very poor section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , of the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we were assigned a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Our <span class="NPIP">place</span> was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we shared it with three other families. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Mostly there were women and older men because the leaders were taken away, about three hundred of them or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And that’s the way the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was surrounded by a high <span class="DLF">fence</span> that was finished off with barbed wire and there were two <span class="DLF">gates</span> , one in the front and one in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Everyone who entered had to have a written permit. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">In the morning the people who worked were marched out and they were marched back in in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> was guarded by Ukrainian militia. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">There were very few Germans in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">They were on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">That’s when our nightmare really began. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">The rations were very meager but if on didn’t work, there was no ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So I did not receive a ration and my mother and my sister had to share. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I mean they didn’t have to but they shared their rations with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">In the beginning people still managed not to give all their material possessions to the Germans so there were some opportunities to barter on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and bring in some milk and bread and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And that’s the way we survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">My mother and a few other of the women organized a clandestine school for children like myself because we were really left with no supervision and nothing to do and they managed to get some school supplies from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> by trading rings or gold or whatever people had. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So for a while we had a wonderful <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the evening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">We, I mean kids, really looked forward to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">They read books and we sang songs and we colored and did all sorts of little stupid things just to occupy our minds but it was very good for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">But it did not last very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">After a few months that sort of dissipated and it disappeared because people didn’t have any more to trade for supplies plus the fact that winter set in and there was a lot of cold and illness and starvation and mostly everyone was just concentrating on being able to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> we were ordered to wear a Star of David, a yellow patch, on the front of our clothing and on the back of our clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Even within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> you couldn’t move without having that patch. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">It was a very difficult thing and even as young as I was I realized that we were separated from the rest of humankind because we were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">We were not as good as anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And that’s a very demoralizing thing to live with. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Most of all I think we were preoccupied with being hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Hunger is something very hard to describe. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">It’s so paradoxical now. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Everyone is on diets and we say we mustn’t eat so much, cholesterol, what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">But real hunger is so painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">It absorbs or it takes over your entire being. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I don’t remember what I ate yesterday but those years are etched in my memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">They were indelible. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I remember I was so hungry that I would do anything to get something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So many times even though I promised my mother I wouldn’t do it, I would sneak out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">QUESTION:  Did a lot of people do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">ANSWER:  Many of the children did it because my age or even younger, the ones who didn’t work, there was nothing to do all day long and all you could think of is how hungry you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And so we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">We had an ingenious, as a matter of fact two <span class="NPIP">places</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where we dug <span class="DLF">holes</span> and camouflaged them and that was not through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> so we would go out, sneak out and try and beg or barter for some food and then we’d go back the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">It was difficult and we were very obvious. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">We were recognized that we were not the same as the people on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> because our clothing and we were dirty and we were unkempt and all that but we didn’t care, we were so hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And some people on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , I say the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , the Ukrainians and the Poles were good to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Others were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">If you were caught on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> it was punishable by death. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I did it a lot of times and I was not caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I’d bring an egg <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to share with my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I would bring a slice of bread or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">One time I did go out and I managed to get two eggs for a little ring and I got it out of my clothing and I was getting back and I was almost at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I would crawl in the <span class="DLF">hole</span> and get back and this Ukrainian militia man caught me. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">He started yelling at me and he searched me. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I had a dress with puff sleeves and I put one here and one in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">He found the eggs and he threw them on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> and made me kneel down and rub my face in the eggs and screamed at me and said get back where you belong and I don’t want to hear from you anymore, I don’t want to see you anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So I guess he was a gentle person because he could have killed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">He didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">But I didn’t give away the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> either. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">He marched me to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and pushed me in and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I had scrapes on my face and whatever but that didn’t count. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">A few days later as a matter of fact a dear friend of mine, she was about eleven a little older than I at that point, and she went out and she got a loaf of bread and she never made it back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they shot her right on the spot and they dragged her body right into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they wouldn’t allow the burial committee, because they had a committee for that, they wouldn’t allow them to bury her for a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">QUESTION:  As a warning?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Yes, there were so many not warnings but I mean sadistic things. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">One time, I mean I could go on for days, one time there were three fellows who made their way from work, young fellows as a matter of fact, and they tried to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And they caught them, three young fellows, I knew one of them, I didn’t know the other two and they gathered us, the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> wasn’t part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and they made us watch when they hung them, three and then they let them hang there for several days. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And each day the people who would go out to work had to march around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">QUESTION:  Pass by them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  Yes, to watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">These guys would stand with whips and if your face was down they would smack you so you would look up and watch the hangings, kids, everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">When we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> my mother still continued digging ditches but my sister managed....
QUESTION:  That was the work that she was doing outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  Yes, supposedly building <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">All she was doing was digging <span class="DLF">ditches</span> , covering one <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and then digging another <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and covering the second <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">That’s all they would do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  They were keeping them busy, basically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But my sister managed to get into an old <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">These were mostly young women who were knitting and crocheting clothing articles for the soldiers on the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">That was a very good job because it was indoors so that was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">But I remember one day she was not feeling well. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">She couldn’t go to work so it was decided that I would take her <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So I took her card.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  How old were you at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER:  About eleven. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">But people didn’t care as long as I had the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">All the Jewish people knew but nobody would say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So I went there and they showed me where her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> was, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and I don’t even remember what she was knitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">It wasn’t crocheting, it was knitting, a scarf or a sweater. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">No, it couldn’t have been a sweater because I wouldn’t know how to do that but a scarf I did know and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And I started knitting and all of a sudden I felt someone was looking at me, watching me and there was this mean looking German going around and just looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And he stood behind me for a while and observed me and apparently I wasn’t doing it fast enough or whatever and he got very angry with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">He started screaming dunner vetter and started cursing. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And I didn’t answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I kept doing what I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Finally I didn’t please him obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">He grabbed the needles out of my hand and stuck one of them in my finger and this is what it is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">I passed out and that was my experience taking my sister’s <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">In the beginning of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there was like a little <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And there was still one doctor left. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And I remember his name, Dr. Grossfeld. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">He tried to do his best to help people but that again didn’t last long. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Pretty soon there was no more <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , there were no more supplies and he disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">That’s another thing that was happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Every now and then at no specific time for no reason obviously a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> would come or a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they would grab people just....
QUESTION:  Just indiscriminately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">ANSWER:  Indiscriminately, babies, little kids, old people, anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">They would just grab them, put them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And you never heard from them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Dr, Grossfeld disappeared in one of those actions where they would come and just grab people indiscriminately. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">That’s why there was also such a demoralizing feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">One never knew, I never knew if I would see my mother and my sister again because these actions could occur during work or after work or before work or anytime. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And that uncertainty too was very, very difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">QUESTION:  If you weren’t going out and trying to get food or something how did you spend your days in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> while they were at work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">ANSWER:  Just sitting or walking with my friends and talking about food. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">That was all we talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">At that point somebody asked me, well didn’t you talk about your Dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">He was taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Well, my mother was really in retrospect when I think of it a phenomenal person. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">She never let us give up hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">She would always talk about plans -- how we would celebrate when Daddy came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I didn’t think it was that unusual but she turned gray overnight when they took my father away. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">She woke up -- she was completely gray. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I guess she knew deep in her soul that my father never would come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Yet she wouldn’t let us give up hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">It was a very difficult time. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But again when I look at it from today’s perspective it wasn’t so bad for me because I still had my mother and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">At that point their love and our caring for each other compensated for all the physical atrocities, and they were atrocities. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">We were cold; we were hungry; we were not well; we were uncertain of out tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">It was almost as if you lived in suspension from day to day. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And that’s the way we coped. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">It was really terrible when you think of coming from a fairly advanced civilized life to living in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with three other families, sharing the whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , that was a big -- I think a three story <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we share one <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and one <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> for the entire <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">QUESTION:  Do you remember how many people were in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">ANSWER:  I would say at least a hundred.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">QUESTION:  And you had one <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and one <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">But anyway life went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Winter came and that was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">There was no heat; there was no warm water. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">There was as a matter of fact very little water, even cold water. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">People started dying, people disappeared in the actions and in early spring we got a new decree.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">QUESTION:  This would be in 1942?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  Yes, early spring of °42. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">We were ordered to move again. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Grab what you can whatever you have and meet in the <span class="NPIP">central place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">That was not the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> but in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">What happened was that they decided our numbers had dwindled and they didn’t need such a spacious <span class="NPIP">place</span> as we had there and they moved us to a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and that was really one of the shabbiest parts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Nobody lived there for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">However there was one redeeming feature in that new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">It was again surrounded by high <span class="DLF">fence</span> and barbed wire and all these goodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">But one side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was right next to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and our assigned <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live was in the little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> right on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and that was not fenced in. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">It was really even worse and smaller than the <span class="NPIP">place</span> we lived before but it was on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and it was important to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  Why was that important?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  Because it was open and it wasn’t guarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">My mother was rather happy with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">When we moved we were again with different people and again there wasn’t enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to sleep us all on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> so we had to build like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> so there were three in a row stacked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And then life went on again the way it was before except that there was much more chaos and people became more panicky and even though we had no outside knowledge of what was going on, no radio, no newspaper, no mail, we were completely cut off from the world, the people who were going out to work would gather some information, rumors from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Somehow rumors begin to float in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that they were going to kill us all soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">There were also visible signs. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">There were more Ukrainian militia in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and there were more Germans within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">They would just march around with their high boots, all dressed up and spit when they’d see you and make you walk on the <span class="DLF">road</span> not on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And then my mother apparently, I don’t know if she started earlier, but that’s when she shared it with my sister and me, that she started looking for some <span class="NPIP">places</span> where we could hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">For a long time she said she couldn’t find, make any connection on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Finally one day in the spring she came back and she was very excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And she said she found two <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">She couldn’t find one <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> for three but she found two. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">One farmer was willing to take two people, obviously for money and another one was willing to take one. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And there was her Solomon’s decision -- who will go where. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Well my mother decided since my sister was four years older than I she could manage by herself and my mother and I would go to the second <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">The farmer who agreed to hide my mother and me was known to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">He was on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and before the war my mother would get, many times she would get dairy products, milk and cheese and butter from this <span class="NPIP">farmer’s place</span> and it sounded very logical to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">How she did connect with them I don’t know but she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">She was not happy but she was satisfied that she was able to accomplish that. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And we just waited for the time that she would say when we should do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And that time came in early August.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  Of 1942?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">One day in the morning or the night before my sister packed her little bundle. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">My mother helped her. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">In the morning we said our goodbyes and we were making plans how we’ ll meet after this horrible time was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I never saw my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">She went to work in the morning and that was the last time I saw her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  Was the plan for her to go from work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  From work to the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  Do you know where her <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> was supposed to be where she was going to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  I know it was right on the outside of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and then the farmer was supposed to come and pick her up from work. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">It was not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skbelka</span> which was the place my mother and I were going to hide.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">QUESTION:  Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skbelka</span> is a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> from....
ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skbelka</span> is a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  Across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> from your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  Across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">She left. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">There were several days my mother didn’t hear anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">She was satisfied that everything went well. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Then she said the time she’II let me know when it’s time for us to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Meanwhile there was a lot of commotion in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , many more Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">They were coming and going and it was evident that something was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">So about a week, I don’t know exactly, but about a week after my sister left she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day from work and we ate our meager supper and she told me to put on two of everything that I had the best which wasn’t that much left. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I remember I had some high top shoes that you don’t wear in the summertime but she said put them on. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">She packed a little bundle of stuff for herself and a bundle for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">She kept repeating giving me directions of how to get to the farmer’s place on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  Were you going to go together or separately?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Together. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">At night when it got dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">You see there were no guards or anything so that was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Otherwise we couldn’t have gotten out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So when it got real dark she took my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We just walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">We didn’t say anything to the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">But everybody had different plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Whoever was left was going their own way and everybody was confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">There was not a good relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">It seemed that nobody knew what to do and everybody wanted to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">They tried to hang on to life whatever it cost. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And so we left and we walked into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">underbrush</span> , the bulrushes and all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">QUESTION:  Now did you have to climb out of your <span class="DLF">window</span> or something like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">QUESTION:  You just walked right out and right to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">ANSWER:  Walked right out. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">That little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> was right on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I guess the Germans felt very secure. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Where would we go? </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And so we started walking towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and all of a sudden shots rang out. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">It was so still. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">It was very, very quiet and so we couldn’t move. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">The shots were sporadic but it lasted almost all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And so we were stuck. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">By morning many other people had the same idea as we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">QUESTION:  To get down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">ANSWER:  That’s right, so every....
QUESTION:  You were still in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">underbrush</span> at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  We were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> but it was it was shallow. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">We were covered. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">It was thick underbrush, these bulrushes I guess and all sorts of things where you could hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">But by morning a lot of other people kept going into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and by that time machine guns were going full blast all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">There were these screams and shouts by the Ukrainian militiamen and this is something I can’t get rid of that sound and of that phrase and they kept screaming; <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ???? </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Meaning crawl out Jew, I can see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Most of the people came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">We didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">We stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">That lasted a whole day and by night when night fell the machine guns were going full blast. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We couldn’t move. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And so we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I remember my mother gave me that soggy bread that she packed and it tasted awful and she made me eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">She said I needed the strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">We spent another night in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and the next morning there was fire and there were screams and I heard babies crying and I guess the time they were liquidating the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I can’t say the water turned red but it should have because the machine guns were going again full blast all the time and we stayed in that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I kept dozing off and I know we stayed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> for a number of days but I don’t know exactly how many days. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">But one moment I opened my eyes and my mother was gone and I really became panic stricken and I tried to rationalize that I probably fell asleep and she had to make her way to the <span class="NPIP">farmer’s place</span> and I would have to find my way there by myself to join her. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And then all of a sudden everything got quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">There was no movement, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And I stayed until dark and then I made my way across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and I walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I remember walking, walking for so long until I came to the <span class="NPIP">farmer’s place</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I’m sure I must have been a sight, dirty and wet and the dogs started barking and the farmer came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">It was just beginning to -- daylight wasn’t -- I mean it was dawn and he came out in his coveralls and I asked him if my mother was there, He said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I said well I'll wait until she comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">He said what do you mean you’ll wait, you will not wait here. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I said you did agree to keep us here for a time, I didn’t know for how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">He said well, I changed my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">It’s too dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I said well, just let me stay until my mother comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">He said you can stay the day, Ill give you something to eat and at night when it gets dark you better leave or I'll report you to the authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And I was just bewildered at that point but it was very ironic because I noticed he wore my father’s gold pocket watch with the coveralls
QUESTION:  That’s what your mother probably paid him....
ANSWER:  I’m sure that was part of it, I’m sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">But his wife gave me some soup and some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I wasn’t even hungry at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> until it got dark and they gave me some bread and an apple. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I remember and they told me to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And I was so I guess bewildered and really panic stricken. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I didn’t think straight and I walked on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Anybody could have seen me or caught me but I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">God was with me I guess if there is a God. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And I walked all the way on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> until I came to an open <span class="DLF">field</span> where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">It’s agrarian, it’s the breadbasket actually of <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> so there were these lush <span class="DLF">wheat fields</span> and I spent the next two days in a <span class="DLF">field</span> just sitting there like in a stupor. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">By that time the bread was gone and the apple was gone and I just didn’t know what to do and my mind refused to give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I felt, I don’t know how to say it, but I felt as if I had let my mother down, that I dozed off if she had to leave me and now he’s looking for someplace for me because he refused to give us protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And so I decided then that my only way to live or to survive is to find my mother and I felt that I have to go and look for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Our <span class="REGION">area</span> has many <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> so I decided then and there -- it was still early fall -- that I have to go from <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> until I find her. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And that’s where my odyssey really starts. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I started going from <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and I walked and walked and the illusion when you look at something -- I mean my geography wasn’t any good but I soon learned south and north and east and west. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">You look at a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and it seems it’s so close and you walk and you walk and it’s not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I walked all night and I tried to rest in the daytime. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">But meanwhile I needed to eat, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">So I would try to go to little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> in the outskirts and grab something from a <span class="DLF">garden</span> or something and that’s the way I survived the first months. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">The first months were also -- several things happened that were horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">In the very beginning I would come across stragglers like myself from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> because apparently Hitler liquidated all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> in our <span class="REGION">area</span> about the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I would find other people in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> who were in similar situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">They were looking for their loved ones, they were looking for friends or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And so I tried to get information about my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Nobody knew anything and I didn’t know anything about theirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">One time we were on the edge of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and there were seven of us from different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">There was a mother and a baby and two boys and two women. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Anyway there were six other people and we were sitting and trying to get information from one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And all of a sudden a bunch of kids from the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> spotted us and they started yelling at us. “</span><span class="sentence" id="570">Jews, Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="571">There was remuneration for reporting a Jew, however small it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And they ran back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we realized that soon somebody’s going to come after us. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">We were sitting on the edge of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">This was -- there are different kinds of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> -- this one had very little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">underbrush</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide except climbing up a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> which wasn’t the smartest thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">But there were huge haystacks in the <span class="DLF">field</span> so we ran to hide in the haystacks and somehow for an unexplainable reason we all ended up in the same haystack, all seven of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I don’t know what the haystack looked like on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> but I’m sure it wasn’t very difficult for them to realize where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Pretty soon we heard voices of the villagers and the kids and they came back, they came there with pitchforks. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">They just made a game of it and they kept pushing the pitchforks into the haystacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">That went on for hours it seems like. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">It was in the afternoon, late afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And pretty soon it was quiet and I heard a lot of commotion around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And when it got real quiet I waited, I think it was the middle of the night when I crawled out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="584">QUESTION:  Were there people still in there with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">QUESTION:  You were alone at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">It was quiet; it was completely quiet and I crawled out and there were six bodies lined up, their clothes gone, their shoes gone, mutilated; couldn’t recognize them except the baby because of the size. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Baby was on the chest of the mother and I was the only one who survived that massacre. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I don’t know why or how. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I don’t know, maybe I was in the middle, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And I stayed there for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I didn’t even cover them with leaves or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I just walked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">There were many incidents like these. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And this went on for three years. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">The winters were very difficult because it was not only hunger and thirst, it was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And the snow, footprints would show in the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Dogs would give you away if you go close to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or to a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I tried, in the winter I tried to go from <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> to <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and to keep warm or I would crawl in, they have these, they were not haystacks but where they kept, where the peasants keep the potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">It’s like....
QUESTION: <span class="INT_SPACE"> Potato cellars</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">ANSWER:  Something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">It was just awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">It was not only the hunger and the cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">It was being alone and sometimes not hearing a human voice for weeks at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">It got so many times where I just didn’t even care but I kept getting my strength from the fact that I had to find my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I never found her. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And then apparently I got very sick and I was like in a little <span class="DLF">grave</span> covered with leaves in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and the Russian soldiers found me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I don’t know how long I was there and they took me to some <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and they nursed me back to health. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">My quest, my search for my mother continued and when the war was over I went back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I found that there was one other person who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">She was an older woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">As a matter of fact she is here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">She lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duluth</span> , <span class="REGION">Minnesota</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And other than that there were no other survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I mean there were people who made their way illegally during the war but the survivors from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were just myself and this other woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And when I got back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> I didn’t learn much except that somebody denounced my sister and they tortured her and they humiliated her. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">They paraded her on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> in the nude and then they murdered her. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And that must have happened very shortly after she left. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I never found out what happened to my mother and I don’t know for sure what happened to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">You know the horrible feeling -- there is nothing tangible for me to mourn. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">When someone dies you have a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , you can go and put some flowers and say a prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I have nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And to this day it seems, I know it’s ridiculous but when I walk and when I see someone -- my father was about 6°4” and my mother was almost 6 foot tall --and when I see someone of the build and height, people remind me of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I have to run in front of them ad look back to see it’s not them. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And then I made my way. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I kept still looking for my mother and everybody said all survivors or people who survived are going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">So illegally from what became the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> again I went through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">That’s the way all the survivors went. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">When we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> there were lots of people, all sorts of people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">The ironic thing was that these people were survivors like myself, the remnants. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And there were people who were running from the consequences of their collaborating with the Germans and so we all ended up in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> and that was very, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">But finally they did separate us. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And then even though we, as a survivor and as an orphan at that point, I still had to wait three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">QUESTION:  You were about sixteen, seventeen years old at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">ANSWER:  About fifteen, yeah and I still had to wait three years to be able to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">QUESTION:  So you lived in one of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for three years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">ANSWER:  I lived in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And the last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I lived is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Benzheim</span> which 1s near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuutgart</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Darmstadt</span> and I managed to go to the University of Heidelberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">How they accepted me is beyond me because I didn’t have any formal education.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">QUESTION:  Past when the war started, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">ANSWER:  Yeah, but I took some tests and I think they felt sorry for me so they admitted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And I went there for two reasons: one, I wanted to get some education and number two, I thought I could get a student’s visa to get to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Well, the visa that I did get, the permanent visa came earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">But it was three years that I had to wait.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">QUESTION:  So you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in ’48?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  1948, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">QUESTION:  Did you have relatives? </span><span class="sentence" id="649">You did, that’s right, your aunts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">There was one aunt, the one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbus</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> and my father’s sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">She’s the only one who’s still alive now. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And she took me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I came in like on June 25" and I think June 26" she sent me to <span class="BUILDING">Central High</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I didn’t speak a word of English and I hated the world and I hated myself but it was the best thing they did, tried to give me some education. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And then I met my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">He was called back into the service and guess where his first assignment 1s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">QUESTION: <span class="COUNTRY"> Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">ANSWER:  That’s right, you’re right. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And I refused to go until I became a citizen, an American citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And then I went back and it was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">That’s my life in a nutshell. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">For many years I didn’t speak out. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I told my husband, I told my son but my family, the few who were still alive didn’t want to hear about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And it was difficult for me to talk about it so I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">But then in 1983 there was a gathering here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and I went to that gathering and something in me, I just sort of awoke and I said I’m ready; I have to tell my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I have a mandate. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I felt as if I have a mandate to speak for all these and I call them martyrs not victims who never had a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And I’m their spokesperson. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I have to speak out and tell the story because I don’t want the world to forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And yet I sometimes, I haven’t done it in recent months, but I was speaking at the Capital Children’s Museum about a year ago and there was a class of -- I think -- fourth graders which is quite young and you speak in not very severe terms to children that age. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">But they came with several chaperones and one of the fathers who was a chaperone came over to me after my presentation and he says Mrs. Skiff....I says Schiff -- yes, Mrs. Schiff come on, admit, it’s all a figment of your imagination. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">So that’s where we are today. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And I feel, I mean that I do have a mission and I try. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">It’s not getting any easier for me but I feel that I do have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I have to tell people what happened and maybe we’|l learn something from our past. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">But apparently we haven’t learned very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Look what’s going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Look what’s going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Somalia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Sudan</span> , the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">People are hungry for power and there’s so much hate in this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I don’t know how we can get rid of it -- intolerance, hate, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So this is my dilemma, what I have to live with. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Do you have any questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">QUESTION:  No, I think I’m done. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  You’re welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Thank you. (</span><span class="sentence" id="688">The tape then resumed)

<p><span class="sentence" id="710">ANSWER:  I'll have that and I don’t know it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  We can approximate. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We can say circa a certain time.</span></p>
