<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Or why’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  I guess it was better for business for my father, was more central, as far as selling or transferring goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I’m just guessing. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I have no idea why. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I guess it was just better for the family, you know, more centrally located. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I would assume that because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where we were born, didn’t even have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> come through there. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">You had to go with a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , which was, you know, about ten klicks (ph), which was about five miles away. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So there was absolutely nothing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">It was strictly agriculture, you know, and so my grandparents had some <span class="REGION">land</span> there and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But I would assume that’s the main reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">He still traveled down to all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and bought the skins and all that stuff, but basically his <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and all that was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and, you know, where they process the stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">That’s as far as I can remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Ah, I don’t know what the problem... I only went to one grade, okay, before the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And so it was, I would assume it was considered a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , but it was a Jewish, ran by the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And basically all the children in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> were Jewish kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But whether it was, you know, sanctioned, whether the Hungarian educational system was part of it or not, I... but it wasn’t religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">It was secular and did basically, read, write, arithmetic, you know, geography, all that other stuff you learn in a normal <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">That’s what we learned, but it was basically, all Jewish children went there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  So was that sanctioned by the state at that point? </span><span class="sentence" id="132">That the Jewish...
ANSWER:  That’s what I’m saying, I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I assume that it was, but there’s no way for me to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  So, that was around what year, that you moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Almozd</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  I don’t know, I could not tell you, from the time that I remember we were already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I was about five or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We were already living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> , so I could not tell you when we actually moved there. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I just know that I was born in ‘35 and I know we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Almozd</span> then, that’s where I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So, somewhere between ‘35 and, you know... 4
QUESTION:  44.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  ‘44. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Oh no, long before then. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I was five, so that would be ‘40, 1940, so somewhere between ‘35 and ‘40 is when the family moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Almozd</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  What language did your family speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Hungarian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Did you speak Yiddish at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  My grandparents spoke and I guess my father knew Yiddish, but we, you know the children, with my mother and father we only spoke Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And when we went to the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> , we prayed in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Because it was basically memorized rote, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , separate <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> to learn to read in Hebrew from the Bible. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we only spoke Hungarian, no other language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  But you mentioned you had a friend who was a Christian boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Was he a neighbor or how did you know him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  He was a neighbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We used to play soccer together and all that kind of stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  When did you start to notice, well the Germans didn’t occupy until 1944, did you notice any anti...
ANSWER:  Oh yes, it started, it started in actually about ‘43. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">What they called, the Hungarian Nazis, which were called the Nilosh, which is the Arrow, Arrow...
QUESTION:  Cross.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  ... something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Nilosh is basically somebody who shoots arrows. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And you started wearing then already yellow stars and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">At the time you just had to wear, you didn’t have to, 1t wasn’t until the Germans came in that they moved us into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">But by then you already had to sew on the yellow stars and all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And the Christian friends all of a sudden disappeared [laughing]. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They didn’t know you anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Even if they wanted to probably their parents told them, you know, “Stay away from them, don’t play with them,” and such and such. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">It started actually in °43, but it really didn’t get serious until ‘44, then when the Germans... and that I remember vividly, because it was Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We went down to my mother’s parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We were going to spend Passover with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And so we all traveled down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I remember it was Passover night or the night thereafter, I’m not sure which, but the policeman from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> came in from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Almozd</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">He came in and said that all Jews must go back to where they lived. “</span><span class="sentence" id="172">So, your daughter,” he told my grandfather, “your daughter and her children must return immediately to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And so in the middle of the night we had to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> and horses and go back to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and catch a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">From there they told us that we have to move into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And so they set aside a square, I don’t know, about two or three square blocks, which they put wooden <span class="DLF">gates</span> up on each end of the 5 <span class="DLF">street</span> , blocked it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And then <span class="DLF">windows</span> that were looking <span class="NPIP">outside</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they bricked them in, so basically you had an enclosed area of so many <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">A couple of <span class="DLF">streets</span> , basically is what it amounted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And they herded everybody in there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Do you remember being herded in there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  Well basically they told us you have so much time to, you know, to gather whatever you could carry, belongings, whatever you could carry and, you know, and move in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So, we moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And they allocated, you know, for each family a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I don’t remember now. </span><span class="sentence" id="184"><span class="INT_SPACE">Space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And stayed there and from there they took the men to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I don’t know whatever kind of work they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And they would come and take them off in the morning with shovels and stuff and then come back at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">My dad wasn’t there, because he was already taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> where, they called it... for the Army, basically they were in the service, but they were labor battalions for the Hungarian Army which was already fighting the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And I guess they were digging <span class="DLF">trenches</span> for them and that kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So he was already taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Back in ‘43 he was already gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">He wasn’t at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">So, he wasn’t there when we were moved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , just my mother and us four children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  Did your older brother, was he old enough to work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  He was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He was already fourteen or fifteen at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">He was apprentice in a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , they were making bristles. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">All kind of... have to think about how to say it... brooms and for...
QUESTION:  Brushes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  Brushes, yeah, that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">All kinds of brushes they were making in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">He worked there as an apprentice. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And my mother kept on sewing. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">That’s basically what we were supported on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  Did you stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with your mother during the day?</span></p>

I think she probably more died from starvation than anything else, because what little food we could get hold, she would feed the kids, me and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I don’t know if she ate any or what, and so her condition... and we were susceptible to any disease that was rampaging around in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">There was no cleaning, you didn’t wash you. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Any kind of hygiene, so who knows what would have caused it.</span></p>

[</span><span class="sentence" id="500">Laughing.] </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So, anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And then the next thing you know the troops, the military was coming through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I guess picking up whoever was still living. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Matter of fact they took us to the <span class="BUILDING">German hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I guess they cleaned it out whoever was in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Anyway they took it over and that’s where they were taking us. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Then they put up big, old <span class="BUILDING">hospital tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">That’s where the children, they brought the children to, we were in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , a big <span class="BUILDING">hospital tent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And I guess they started feeding us slowly, slowly because we had hardly any stomach left. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">That’s what killed a lot of people, I understand, is they gave them too much food too soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Got diarrhea and all that, they couldn’t handle it on their bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">So anyway, wasn’t much left of me by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">But anyway from there the Swedish Red Cross came and picked up all the children without any family and everything and took us to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="515">They put us on one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Red Cross trains</span> and we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malmo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Had those white <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> with red crosses on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">From there they took us to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Swedish hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , I mean <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malmo</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  I picked some up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">There were a lot of children who were Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So, it was pretty hard to learn anything, because of all the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Nobody was teaching me anything in Hungarian, which was the only language I really knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">But I learned there. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I was able to speak pretty good Polish by the time I was done there, and German, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And anyway, that was the education that we got.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  There was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> within the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> itself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  That’s what I’m saying, they had some teachers, I guess, who were, before the war who were teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">But one was a German, the other one was a Polish, that taught the subject, but in their language, because that’s the only one that they knew how to use, so. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">But if you weren’t a Polish child, it didn’t mean nothing to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">What do I need to learn Polish? </span><span class="sentence" id="551">How to spell or whatever Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">The German guy, he, I think he taught math, so that was okay, one and one 1s two, you know, doesn’t make no difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">As long as you understood what he was trying to say on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">blackboard</span> , so you could follow him fairly reasonable. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Anyway they disbanded the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And by that time my sister was fifteen and she had to go out and work. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">They told her she has to find a job and go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And they took me to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I mean it wasn’t a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tabo</span> (ph), in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And basically I was on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">There was a woman who was a cook there, who was basically supposed to look after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Look over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And they enrolled me in a <span class="BUILDING">Swedish school</span> , so now I had to learn Swedish. [</span><span class="sentence" id="563">Laughing.] </span><span class="sentence" id="564">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Now I went to one grade in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and what little schooling I got there at the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And from there they started me off... I think in sixth, according to my age, which was sixth grade or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Sixth, seventh grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And obviously it wasn’t easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">But the children there was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">They were fairly friendly for a stranger, you know, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">A couple of friends I had there. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">One was a little, wanted to be a jockey. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">There was a <span class="DLF">horse farm</span> not far from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">He and me used to go to the <span class="DLF">horse farm</span> and try to get, let him ride the horses and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">So, anyway I was there for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And a Jewish family came and they introduced me to them, and blah, blah, blah. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">They basically took me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with them, in other words, they were going to be my guardians. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">They lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , so we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And they enrolled me in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">They treated me nice, as a 14 matter of fact they wanted to adopt me, but by that time I found my brother and my other sister, Miriam, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So I said, “No I don’t want to be adopted. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I’m going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So, that’s what I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">QUESTION:  How did you find your brother and sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">ANSWER:  Through the Red Cross and through the Jewish Agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">We looked for Father, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And I found my father also. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">He went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> looking for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">He wrote and said, “Do not come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="591">He said, “I’m going back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">When I get there I want you to join me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">In the meantime stay where you are.” </span><span class="sentence" id="594">But I didn’t want to stay there, so I signed up to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And my sister, I guess by that time she had a boyfriend, whatever, anyway she decided she wanted to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">She stayed there, and I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">QUESTION:  What made you decide you wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> rather than staying in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> as you father had suggested?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">ANSWER:  Well, because I... I been always close to my older brother, and my older brother and sister was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , so I said, “Well I'll just go there and wait for them until Father gets to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , instead of here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="599">So anyway, that’s what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">That was in ‘49, in May ‘49, I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">The Swedish family, they wanted me to stay and they were going to adopt me and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I didn’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And later on, I’m glad I didn’t, because that guy, my sister told me that the guy and his wife got divorced. [</span><span class="sentence" id="604">Laughing.] </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So, you know, anyway, that’s neither here nor there. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">They were nice people, they treated me fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">As a matter of fact, my thirteen birthday, my Bar Mitzvah, they did that at the big <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  Well, he had milk cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">He had about fourteen milking cows, so you had to grow feed for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And you had, he grew vegetables, tomatoes and cucumbers and that kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Eggplants. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Cauliflowers, corn, you know, just basically, it wasn’t, the <span class="REGION">land</span> over there, you don’t have no 16 huge <span class="REGION">acreage</span> anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">You’re talking about... dunam (ph), I guess, I don’t know how to compare it with acres. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">But I would say he had no more than maybe fifteen acres of <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And so he had to raise alfalfa to feed the cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">One thing he didn’t have to worry about, 1s that like here you have to cut hay and put it away and all that, so that you would have food for the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Over there it grows year-round, semi-tropic, so you don’t have to worry about not having feed for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">You just have to make sure that... but we grew hay, you know, alfalfa for... and cut hay to feed the cows, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Basically I worked out on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , plowed, picked tomatoes, picked this and picked that and weeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">All the things you do ona <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Milked cows and all that stuff.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="675">QUESTION:  During the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">They never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And I never talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">As a matter of fact, you’re probably only about the second or third person I ever talked about, talked about it at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">First time I ever, well beside Yad Vashem, you know, when we got interviewed, but that was with both my sisters there and they did most of the talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And last year, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> asked me to join them on Yom Ha... Remembrance, Day of Remembrance and all that, to tell my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So I reluctantly agreed that I would tell them whatever I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And so I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I went up there and said my piece. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And that was, beside this here, that’s about the only time. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I don’t talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And matter of fact, Professor Dickstein wanted me to go to one of the <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> and speak to the children about my experience and I declined. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I said I just can’t handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I’m not going to constantly dig it out, dig it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I just can’t live like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I’m just not willing to constantly put myself through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">So, I don’t, normally don’t talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I want to put it behind me, not in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">QUESTION:  What made you agree to talk to me and to talk to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">ANSWER:  Well, I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I just, I think probably the main thing that motivated me on that is I read in <span class="NPIP">places</span> where, especially where they had the trial in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> about people saying it never happened and all that stuff, 1t’s somebody’s fantasies. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And I’m here to tell you that it did happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And I guess that’s probably the main reason that I agreed to talk about it, is that, you know, people are trying to change history. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And if you don’t learn nothing, you don’t learn no lesson from what happened, it can happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">That was my biggest motivation of joining the US Army, is I felt that the Russians weren’t that much better than the Nazis were. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">They had the gulags, they had the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="702">May not have been prosecuting Jews per se, but they were prosecuting human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">That’s basically what decided, probably the only force in the world 17 during this period of time that could prevent something like that happening is the U.S. Armed Forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And so that was my main reasoning for joining the Service. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I served in the Israeli Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I fought in the <span class="REGION">Sinai Desert</span> in ‘56. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And so I’ve been through the wringer. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">But that wouldn’t affect <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , doesn’t affect the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And probably the only force in the world at this time of human history who can make a difference is the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and the U.S. Armed Forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So, that was my main motivation of joining the Service.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  Another question, looking back on those days just after the war when you were a young boy in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , did you, I’m trying to think of how to form the question. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">But I’m wondering about whether you, you were questioning or whether you understood why you and your family and others had been singled out for this, for this horrible persecution. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Did you have any understanding of what...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">ANSWER:  Yeah, I understood that it was basically based on my religion, basically that’s the only thing that... you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And then as I got older and I read. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I’m not educated very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I finished <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> GED and I got some <span class="BUILDING">college</span> behind me, about sixty-eight credit hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">But basically I read a lot, and my understanding that the foundation for this disaster has been laid a long, long time and is basically... I don’t blame any particular faith, but basically they were teaching in <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and stuff that the Jews killed Jesus and this and that and always had limitation on what Jews can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">They always kept them outside of the mainstream society. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And they were prohibited to be in certain trades and they were always prohibited in doing certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">So they were always kept like foreigners, you know, strangers or foreigners, whatever you want to call them. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And then the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> teaching basically demonized them. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">So, I don’t think it was too hard for somebody like Hitler to come along and demagogue the issue to the point where people didn’t, didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Because it’s supposed to be that most of them were Christians, supposedly supposed to love thy brother and turn the other cheek and all that stuff, they’re teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">But I guess that wasn’t what, what actually happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I’ve seen them take a little baby and smash him against, his head against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And what human being would do something like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And then they go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> to pray? </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I mean, you look back at most of the wars in this world today, most of the time, most of it is based on religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Take a look right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="732"><span class="COUNTRY">Sudan</span> , got a Muslim against the Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="733"><span class="REGION">Northern Ireland</span> , Catholics against the Protestants. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">You go to <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , you got the... <span class="COUNTRY">Sri Lanka</span> , you got one sect fighting another and again it’s religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="735"><span class="COUNTRY">Iraq</span> , Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">So every <span class="NPIP">place</span> you look at, to me anyway, from what I read and seen, the biggest disaster in this world is religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">That’s my view.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">QUESTION:  How does that, how does that translate to your feelings about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and protecting <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="739">You fought and risked your life fighting for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">ANSWER:  Well, that’s something different, because if there was an <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> before the Second World War, before... this probably, I mean the Holocaust probably never would have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Because I’m not looking at it as religion, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I look at it as a homeland for a people. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Because you can take the Bible as a religion or you can take the Old Testament as a history of a people. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And ’'m Jewish and the Bible, the Old Testament to me is the history of my people, and as such every people need a homeland. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And that’s what motivated me. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">But I always consider myself American, which is really funny, that even before the war, my dad always told me that he was American, so I considered myself American. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And he was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , New York in 1906. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">18 And he always told me that he is American and one of these days we’re going to go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="749">So, it was very natural for me, once I found him and once he got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> himself and everything, that in ‘59 I came and joined him in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">QUESTION:  Had his parents been American or Hungarian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">ANSWER:  From what I understand and I’m really not positive, but it seems to me, what happened was that his parents or his grandfather, 1t was him and his father, immigrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> back in the 1800s or somewhere, you know, late 1800s. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And they lived here, matter of fact, I got an aunt, who was born here and never left here. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">She’s passed away now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">But her whole life, she was born in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and passed away in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So, they lived here, I guess in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and either during the Depression, or early, they decided that they would be better off and went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">That’s my understanding as to what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And then my father was still, wasn’t... his sister was old enough that she said no, she’s not going back with them, she’s staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">My father probably wasn’t old enough, you know, to be on his own, so his father took him back with him to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="759">That’s my understanding, you know, is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">But I’m not exactly sure as to what year, you know, they came and what year they went back and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">But that basically what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Like I say, probably if not for that, that he was born here, I probably wouldn’t be sitting here talking to you, because I would have wound up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="763">QUESTION:  About your early years in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , did you feel at all... I don’t know whether this 1s, well...
ANSWER:  Ask away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">QUESTION:  [Laughing.| I had read and heard from a couple people that Holocaust survivors in some cases, were discriminated against in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or looked down upon by people who had come before the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Did you experience anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  No, I personally didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Of course, I was basically with the youth, the youth movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">It might have happened in some <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I’m not saying it didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">It might have. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">But in my personal experience, like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where I was at, there was no, you know, down look. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">You pulled your share. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I’ve never been a whiner anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">You know, I always pull my share, whatever needs to be done, Ill go take care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I worked and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Pulled guard duty at night with everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Went with the youth and learned how to use a weapon and at night when the Arabs came and stole cows and stuff, we chased after them. [</span><span class="sentence" id="778">Laughing.] </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I was, I personally did not feel that I was in any way looked down at or discriminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">But could have been better treatment? </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Sure, it could have been better treatment for everybody involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">But, you know, you’re talking about a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> just been formed, poor, wasn’t a whole lot of anything there. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And everybody did the best they could with what they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Sure I would have liked to have gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> full time and learned something, had a degree in something, at least had a trade of some kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">But I didn’t expect that, it was just the way things worked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I got no complaints personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">If there’s some people that say they were discriminated against, might have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">I have not, my personal, maybe because my brother was already there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">He served in the Palmach, which was their elite troops in those days in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">So, I was, I 19 guess under his protective wings or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">But I personally did not feel any, and my sister was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> by then, Miriam. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">So, I did not feel that I was discriminated against.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="803">QUESTION:  When did you start serving in the Army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="804">ANSWER:  I joined the Israeli Army in ’50... I was seventeen, so let’s see, thirty-five, forty-five, fifty-two, so ‘52 is when I, or the beginning of ‘53 1s when I... ‘52. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Because my brother had to sign because I wasn’t old enough and I volunteered, so he had to sign my paper so I could join the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">So it was °52, was when I...

End of Tape 2, Side A 21 Tape 2, Side B
ANSWER:  Later on I found out I didn’t need all that stuff, that I have... I really didn’t need a visa till if I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> before I was twenty-four years old, I was automatically a U.S. citizen, because I was considered an American due to my father’s birth. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">So anyway, so ‘59 is when I got to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> .</span></p>

[</span><span class="sentence" id="1098">Laughing.] </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Anyway they did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">So, I personally I really can’t tell, say that... I wasn’t prosecuted or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">I wasn’t threatened or anything in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">Insensitivity? </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">Sure, but, you know, that’s everyday life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Doesn’t bother me any. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">Once they knew I was Jewish, then I don’t ever, never remember a guy twice telling jokes in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">And if he was a buddy of mine, then fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">I got a Jewish joke for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">I says, “That’s okay, let’s hear it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">But that was friendly banter not out of malicious, you know, hurtful type of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">So that’s quite different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">No, I can’t, honestly can’t say that I was in any way discriminated or treated unfairly or differently because I’m Jewish while I was in the Service. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">I really, honestly can’t say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">I don’t know maybe I was just fortunate, you know, the units that I was with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">Or you know, what I can answer... matter of fact, once I had a Jewish Ist Sergeant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">I had a Jewish guy working for me later on when I got up in the grades.</span></p>

ANSWER:  No, that was before me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">I mean integration started before I got into the Service. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">The integration started with Truman during the Korean War. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Prior to the Korean War he ordered the Army to integrate its units. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">Because before you had separate black, separate... but we had a lot of racial problems even when I first got into the Service in the sixties. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">As a matter of fact, we had a race riot and we had fights, racial fights and that kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">Because, you know, for me, since I did not, wasn’t raised with black, first time I ever seen blacks was when I got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">I had no prejudice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">I wasn’t raised with any kind of preyudice against anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">So, I basically, as I always, I would take an individual for himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">You know, I rate an individual for the individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">If he deserve respect, he got respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">If I didn’t care for him, whether it’s white, black, whatever, then I didn’t care for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">It wasn’t because of his race. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">It’s because I didn’t care for his character or his behavior or, you now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">That’s the way, you know, it was for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">But when I got in in 1960, you had a Brown Boot Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">I don’t know if you understand what a Brown Boot Army was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">But Brown Boot Army, you had... basically, we had, like, our Company, we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">There wasn’t a stitch of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , anything, it was an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">If you had any problem with anybody, you and him just went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and settled your business with your fists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">That’s the way things were done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">We had a Platoon Sergeant, his name was Cooper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">He was half Indian and half Irish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">And he was about 64” and weighed about two hundred thirty, somewhere around there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">And you messed up and he’d take you into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there and put you through the woodshed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">So he had a very well behaved 26 Platoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Everybody worked together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">You can’t legislate away prejudice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">That’s something that you learn at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from your parents, from your society, from your parents, whatever, <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">What you can do with the Army 1s, you force civility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Regardless of whether you like him or not, while you are 1n the unit and while you are in the Army, you treat him the way you expect to be treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">And later on when I became a Platoon Sergeant, whatever, that was my guiding principle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">I didn’t care whether... I say, “I don’t care if you like him or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">That’s neither here nor there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">You two work together, perform the job, be civil to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">Once you get to know each other maybe you like him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">You know what I’m saying? </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">That’s all you can expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">You can’t legislate love or you can’t legislate racial prejudice away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">That’s silly to even think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Just like now, all this silly thing about the gays and all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">I don’t hate gays. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">Bible says that’s wrong, but I would want to know if anybody in my unit was gay that I had to fight with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">I might have to, he might have to give me mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">Or I had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> with him, if I know he is gay I would be uncomfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">Not a question that I hate him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">That question doesn’t make no sense, because in the Service you live so close together, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">There is no little <span class="INT_SPACE">shower stall</span> where you go in in your privacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">They got one big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with a bunch of shower heads where everybody takes <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And guys just feel uncomfortable when they know somebody is gay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And that’s the problem, not that anybody has anything against gays. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">In my view anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And you got AIDS, you don’t want to have to deal with somebody out in the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> if you get shot if you know he is gay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">You’re going to deal with it, try to patch his wound, which you have to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And then catch AIDS from him, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">Those are the issues that people don’t think about when they condemn the Armed Forces, well they’re preyudice or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">There’s a lot more to it than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1176">QUESTION:  Were you surprised at all by some of the racism that you found in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that is founded on principles of equality?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1177">ANSWER:  Yeah, I was surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">You know, because... I really didn’t realize it till I got to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> due to the fact that I never encountered any black people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">So when I worked for Fiber, for Ephart Fiber and Rubber Company, they had blacks there and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">I was friends with, I treated them, like everybody with respect just like I treat everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I got to be friend with one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">But I noticed that every time like when you sit down to eat or this and that or lunch, or whatever, you would see all the whites congregating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">All the blacks would go sit over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">There was no interaction between the races. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">That kind of struck me funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">So, I sit down and I sit down with...

QUESTION:  This is tape number three, side A of an interview with Paul Schlisser.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1187">ANSWER:  So anyway, the Fiber... I worked with a fellow worker who was black, and when everybody went to lunch I noticed all the whites were sitting on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and all the blacks were sitting somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">And the guy I worked with, he sat down to eat lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">I just got my lunch and sat down beside him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">He kind of looked at me a little funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I didn’t realize there was anything wrong with it, because, you know, I had no idea it was not supposed to be that way.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1193">ANSWER:  Sure, yeah, every morning, every day lunch we usually, he and me, we’d sit down and have lunch and talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">He was asking me about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and I was telling him about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Laughing. ] </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">And you know, he would tell me about what they were doing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newark</span> , his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">Yeah, I mean, you know, we became friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1198">QUESTION:  Where were you posted in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1199">ANSWER:  My first tour I was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">I was with the Ist Battle Group, 15th Infantry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">And that’s the same outfit that Eddie Murphy was in the Second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">The most decorated individual in the Second, Third Infantry Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">And Eisenhower was in the same outfit, at one time Company Commander a long, long time ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">So, it’s a famous unit and I served it two years in the Straight Leg Infantry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1205">QUESTION:  And you were on another tour in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> later?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1206">ANSWER:  At the time I got out... I was draftee, so when I finished my two years I got out and went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> and looked around and decided I was going to go into heating and air conditioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">And so I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and then I had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">And I said, “Well this ain’t going to get it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">No time for myself or anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">Went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> you went to work and next morning got up, went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">You had no time for yourself, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">So I said, “Well I’m going to go back into the Army, this time voluntarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">I’ll make the Army a career.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Because I liked the Service, its purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And during that time we went up to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called L.Z. X-Ray, which is now longer classified anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">But it was up on the <span class="DLF">Czechoslovakian border</span> and there was a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> there that was mined. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And you went up there, pulled your duty for a month at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And if the balloon ever would go up, or the East Germans would attack the West, the job was to blow up the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">It was all mined and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">So then I realized, I seen the <span class="DLF">border</span> and all that, I realized that this whole, back basically, the Russians were back to where the Nazis were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Plus I read, I don’t know then or a little later, Solzhenitsyn’s book about the gulags and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">And I said, heck, they’re no better than the Germans were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">So anyway I decided I was going to go back into the Service. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">So, I re-enlisted and lo and behold they went and sent me back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="1225">Laughing.] </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">That was my second tour in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">We were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaiserslautern</span> and spent three years there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">It was an <span class="BUILDING">Army Depot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">I went into the <span class="DLF">maintenance field</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">Then I came back, went to the 18" Airborne Corps in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bragg</span> , <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bragg</span> , <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span> there was a little altercation in 28 the <span class="COUNTRY">Dominican Republic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">There was a Leftist uprising and they had to send in the 82™ Airborne and I was with the 556 Light Maintenance Company and we were in there for support. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">My platoon went in to support the 82™ in their operation in the <span class="COUNTRY">Dominican Republic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">That was ‘65. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">Came back from there, our unit was declared D-1, which means that we were alerted that we were going to get shipped to ‘Nam. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">So we had to pack everything, all the equipment of the unit and all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">That was going on, the deadline rates which means the equipment, inoperability of a lot of the equipment on post at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Bragg</span> got so big that they told us to unpack our stuff and go back to work. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1238">Laughing.] </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">So, we went back to work and then they started taking individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">Like me, they took me, not me, but from the unit just individuals and shipped them to <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">So 1966, I was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">I was there in the <span class="REGION">Central Highlands</span> for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">And say well I’m just going to go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and get shipped back here again, so I might as well extend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">So, I extended, got promoted and was sent to the Korean Tiger Division, support of the Korean Tiger Division, along <span class="DLF">Highway 1</span> , between Bomber 2 and Elza English (ph)*. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">Anytime the Korean Tiger went out on a sweep and destroy, we went with them in support of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">In ‘68 I came back to, from ‘66 through ‘68, I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">I came back from <span class="COUNTRY">Vietnam</span> in, I think it was November ‘68 and was assigned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Knox</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">I reported in, in December ‘68 to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Knox</span> and I became an instructor in the <span class="BUILDING">Armor School</span> .</span></p>
