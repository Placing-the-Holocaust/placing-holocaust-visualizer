QUESTION:  And 1s that why it’s so expensive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  It — well, that’s only part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We took that raw maple syrup and ran it through — we — we mixed it with milk and the milk absorbed all the solids in it, and it came February 19, 2013 out beautifully clear, and — and it sold at that time for about several dollars a pint. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And several dollars back then was a lot of money.</span></p>

ANSWER:  And I had a cast iron <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> that I chopped my own wood and kept warm with. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">It probably was a luxury compared to what these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">But anyway, I was offered a job at <span class="BUILDING">Montgomery Ward</span> and Company during the 19 — seven — I think that 19 fo — 1939, 1940, °41, ’42. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And I—

<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  And, well, if your mom was a correspondent from the newspaper, those are the sorts of facts that newspaper people know. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Tell me, 1-1f you can, were they all pretty similar in background, all pretty similar in religion? </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Was there a predominant religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  The predominant religion in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was — most of them were like Lutheran and — and — a-and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">There were several Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">One owned the <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> downtown, and — and — February 19, 2013
QUESTION:  You knew what I was getting at. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I wanted to find out whether or not there had been any Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , whether people knew them, whether you had gotten to know anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">That was —

<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  That’s correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">February 19, 2013
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So let’s ta-take us through then, the enlistment process, where you enlisted and what happened after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Well, we enlisted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wausau</span> , <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> , which is a much, much larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , it must have had at least 15,000 people in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">About 50 percent larger, I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But that was the center of a lot of activities up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And so we were taken down to — to <span class="REGION">northern Illinois</span> , where they had a — a center for processing the — the troops and so forth, where we got all of our shots, and all of our — all of our warnings, an-and — and early — early instruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">The fact I’d been in National Guard though, made me kind of special, because I then was put in charge of small delegations that started training. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">From there we were shipped, after the initial equipping and issuing of clothing and blankets, and so forth, I was shipped to <span class="BUILDING">Jefferson barracks</span> Missouri, which 1s adjacent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Louis</span> , Missouri. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And <span class="BUILDING">Jefferson barracks</span> was — it was cold, and middle of the — middle of the winter, virtually. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And down there we were placed in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , and very, very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">There we got all of our real tough shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And the shots made us so sick that we were afraid we wouldn’t die. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">There, while I was at <span class="BUILDING">Jefferson barracks</span> , and that — we started our training there, I’d — I did the drill sergeant role of taking the raw recruits and showing them how to march and how to turn and how to stop and the proper commands and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">But then the newspaper headlines come out; Roosevelt, we will be building 125,000 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">It was February 19, 2013 beyond belief, but anyway, it didn’t make that much sense because during the time that I had gone through medical — the medical exams, I got what is commonly known as white coat fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And the — and — and I got excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I was so worried that I wouldn’t pass, that I, of course, didn’t, and my blood pressure went sky high during the exams. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Well, so, I wasn’t apparently a good candidate, and probably wouldn’t la-last too long.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  For what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Well, poor health and all that part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  No, no, but what were you — was this to be accepted as — in — into the pilot program?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  That exactly right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  Okay, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They had lesser than — other programs had lesser requirements, physically, so I had no problem with any physical and I had no problem with high blood pressure at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I had no bla — trouble with eyesight, but when it — when we finally got down to <span class="BUILDING">Jefferson barracks</span> , I chose my second choice, which was radio.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Radio training took me to <span class="DLF">Scott Field</span> , <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> , just shrip — just across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> from our training at <span class="BUILDING">Jefferson barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And at <span class="DLF">Scott Field</span> I went through the February 19, 2013 course of radio, which I just loved the course, cause I I-loved the idea so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Where I learned to — how a radio works, and I went — I was selected then to become an instructor, cause I had such enthusiasm for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I instructed radio there until I got a waiver on the two year requirement to join the — the radio — radio officers’ program, and officers’ cadet program. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And I was sent to <span class="BUILDING">Yale University</span> via — via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valley Forge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And we spent some time at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valley Forge</span> , again taking courses and so forth, leading up to the time that they accept us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yale</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And we march in — in — in and out the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> [indecipherable] <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And I was —
QUESTION:  What year — excuse me again, I’m interrupting, but what year was this when you were accepted to go into <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="116">How far in the 40s were we?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  We were, at that time, ’42 probably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  ’42. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Things happened so fast. ’</span><span class="sentence" id="121">42 and then °43. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Yes, that — ’42.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  And then I was a little bit — I also was, before I joined the National Guard, I was a — played in a little band and I was a trumpeter in the band, played the coronet, and the French horn and trombone and a few other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I was selected as the bugler. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Now of course, every — Reveille was the mor — get them out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">February 19, 2013
QUESTION:  You must have been a popular guy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  So, then we stayed at a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">mansion</span> that we were allowed to use, we used that for — <span class="DLF">marble staircases</span> all. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And then they had a — way up in the top was kind of a little <span class="REGION">area</span> where you could go up and look out over the terrain and there’s where I took — took all — care of all the bugling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  You had the <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for it, huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Yeah, and th-then — from there, I eventually went directly to ma — ru — to — went directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> , <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> where we were put up in the ya — <span class="BUILDING">Yale dormitories</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And we were immediately put on a program of radio, army radio and — and all communication, different types of communication such as teletype — and at that time teletype was really coming into its own. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And — and also, the sig — signal corps type of — of wire communications, telephones, laying wire —
QUESTION:  That must have been fascinating stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  It’s very — I was very f — in that th —I was so thrilled with the course, that of course I paid more attention than the average person. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And after a period there, I forget the exact number of months, but let’s say during the time that I was there, we had occasional nights we could go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And I loved ice skating. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Coming from <span class="REGION">northern Wisconsin</span> , I was pretty good at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So I did figure skating, so I went to the <span class="DLF">ice rink</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And there I saw a young girl skating around in a short skirt February 19, 2013 and I couldn’t take my eyes off her. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But I only ha-had a problem, I only had 50 cents with me, because we hadn’t been paid for weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So anyway, she eventually came up and she had had her clothes in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">balcony seat</span> that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And we got acquainted and so I took her down and I blew the 50 cents on a Coke for her and her sister, who was along. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I was so fascinated with her that she came to my graduation — we knew each other at least two weeks by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Came to my graduation, and after graduating we went down and got all our new army uniforms, they were so beautiful, long overcoat, and we just couldn’t get over how great we looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Then we were, shortly thereafter, shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boca Raton</span> , <span class="REGION">Florida</span> , because my graduation score was 98.2, and the top — the top five of the gr — of the grade was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boca Raton</span> for radar training.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  And — and then the radar — we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boca Raton</span> , <span class="REGION">Florida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">When I say we, the gentleman that become the 89" radar officer was a buddy of mine that we stuck kind of together. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And so we landed at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in our heavy bu — beaver overcoats, then we had the wool, green, then we had the pink [indecipherable] trousers. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But we wouldn’t take them off, cause we just —
QUESTION:  Cause you looked so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">February 19, 2013
ANSWER:  — we looked so good and we just couldn’t take them off. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">But that’s some of the things I remember, and — and then we went through a very, very grueling course on radio — radar. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And radar was so new that information was coming from a mass — the <span class="BUILDING">MIT labs</span> , where they invented s-some of the aspects, including the — a very powerful tube that could generate enormously strong pulses. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Well, we then took it ri — almost from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">design desk</span> and we went through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and learn — learning how it worked and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And you may have seen the underbelly of some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> that had a bubble under it. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">This was an antenna housing that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pathfinder aircraft</span> used eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So we didn’t know a thing about what the — we were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">We were learning it and it wasn’t important that we knew the whole story. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So anyway, after being down there about three weeks, I — I couldn’t get over the idea of the little girl I met. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So I—I wrote a letter up to her mother, and says, I’d love to have her come down, cause she is the one I want to spend my life with. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So anyway, the father sent his approval down, along with his daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And we — we — we met and I had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> all picked out and — and so we lived off base actually, but right away the big job was to get married, cause that was a time that you never lived together. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I mean, there was no — no way that could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So —
QUESTION:  And she had some say in this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Well yes, she had — she — she loved the idea, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">February 19, 2013
QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  I don’t know what she saw in me, but anyway, I think she liked the idea, I was a pretty good figure skater. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I could — I could skate circles and so forth, you know, and backward flips and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So anyway, she came on down and so we found that we had to have the mother’s signature as well as the father’s signature on approval.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  So we immediately forged that, and — and we went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">She knew how, you know, pretty well how to write. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So we went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> and went to the Justice of the Peace down there, and — and — for the ceremony. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And she so happened to be cross-eyed, so the thing I do remember, that we were married by a cross-eyed Justice of the Peace, and a — and April the fifth of 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  And we just celebrated our 70" wedding anniversary. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So —

<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  But anyway, then a number of these wings consisted of the ninth troop carrier command. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And that’s the big thing I want to come out of what we’re saying here, February 19, 2013 because the ninth troop carrier command had more effect on the liberation, because of the fact they shortened the war by so much by what they did.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  So that took place on this side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , but most of the training of the pilots and navigators, radio operators, crew chiefs, took place in my kind of a <span class="INT_SPACE">conference room</span> that I had in addition to the <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> and so forth of my <span class="BUILDING">office building</span> that was right off the <span class="DLF">runway</span> of our main <span class="DLF">airfield</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greenham Common</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="377">QUESTION:  By that point — I know you, you know, from your story we get a sense of — of real intensive focus on the work that you’re doing, on the technology, on learning everything that you know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">What about the wider political events that were going on at the time? </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Do you remember, do you hear, did you read newspapers about how the war was progressing before the invasion? </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Did you hear anything about what was happening to the Jews of Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  We heard about it, but it wasn’t concentrated like it should have been, and — and of course, like we discovered later. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">We — we knew we had to c — we had cut the head off that monster.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  We knew that, because they were very close to running the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Had it not been for the power of our — our county’s <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , and the — and the <span class="REGION">home front</span> — they did a marvelous job. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I give them so much credit for actually winning the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">But the — the — unfortunately the word of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were treated more or less like February 19, 2013 propaganda. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">We — we couldn’t believe anything like that could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">It just was a case of we were too naive to — it wasn’t a case we were ins — insin — insincere, it was a case we just didn’t know any better. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And of course, being 20 years old, you don’t get buried in politics anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So —
QUESTION:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">ANSWER:  So that was the —
QUESTION:  I’m just trying — you see, the reason why I asked this question is I’m trying to get an — a sense of the context of the time, the mood of the time, the level of knowledge of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">You know, what had priority and what had less priority, and how much did people know and — and what they were aware of. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Which I think you’ve addressed, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">It — they only knew what the army — what the top peop — top generals and so forth, wanted them to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">They wanted their morale to stay up and they didn’t want to be discouraged in — in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , because they were doing such a marvelous job of reaching that goal of Roosevelt’s of 120,000 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Couldn’t — couldn’t be done, but it did, it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And so al — they only fed them information that was relatively good, and that’s one reason — one of the primary reasons, I believe, they didn’t want too much bad news to get out, where we had | — made — we lost a battle, or where we made a mistake, or something like the mistake February 19, 2013 that was made where all of those British paratroopers d-died because a bad mistake in judgment by the superiors, and —
QUESTION:  We can perhaps come to that — come to that point when — in your narrative I remember —
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">QUESTION:  — it’s something that you wrote about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="401">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  Did you hear then, about the bow — Battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> , which was in 1943?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  Yes, we heard about that and of course all we heard was the good part of it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We didn’t hear — although we knew — we knew that Stalin was brutal, we knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">We knew the Russians were probably not — you know, following that course, was not the nicest people on earth. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So, I— we — we followed that Battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> cause we were so delighted over the fact that the Germans were losing. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And so that was good news to come across.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">QUESTION:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">ANSWER:  But the news of all the people that was lost at our <span class="BUILDING">air base</span> during a short period of time, that didn’t get back to the public. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">No one knew about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  Well, let’s talk about that a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Was this in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER:  It was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">February 19, 2013
QUESTION:  Okay, so tell us the story in a — in — yeah, tell us the story, tell us what happened with such losses?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  Well, the worst things Pll — Pll tell you about. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">The — there was — there was a tremendous concentration of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> bombing the <span class="DLF">coast</span> and bombing inland and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="417"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Planes</span> were flying overhead all the time, going back and forth, a constant drone, you couldn’t sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I mean, around the clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">The two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">C-47s</span> , cause of the weather, bad weather, two 40 se — C-40 — not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">C-47s</span> , but two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-17s</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> , collided right — almost directly over our base.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION:  Oh my.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">ANSWER:  And the debris scattered over a very large <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And hearing the — I was one of the few people that heard the crash. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">It was a tremendous explosion, and — and so pieces of everything, engines and bodies and stuff were coming down all over the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I was one of the very first on the scene, because I onl — my off — radar building was only a short distance away. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> that I had assigned to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I jumped in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and drove over to the — where I knew the sound had come from, and then I started to see that debris all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And the first sight I saw of a body was a young navigator. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">The navigator — I knew he was a navigator because the body was quite intact, and it was lying on his back. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And he was partially buried because the force of dropping to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And he — his — he was a little — little gray looking and so February 19, 2013 forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">But he looked like he was sleeping, like peacefully sleeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">But his ta — his watch was still running, that’s [indecipherable] a strange thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And then, little beyond I saw a body that was decapitated from hitting — from going through a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree branch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And — and — and then — then a lot of the pe — lot of the people from the base started to come over and we all were scattered through to see if there was any SUIVIVOTS.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  Were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  Yes, there was a pilot, I think, one pilot, or maybe th — I can’t recall now for sure, but I think at least one pilot survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And the pilot that didn’t survive, I — I’ve, in the last couple years I got — I’ve got to know who — who — who their relatives were and they’ve written to me and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">They found out through another — I had another interview with the BBC, and somehow or other that got out and they — they got ahold of me, and it was kind of — kind of sad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="439">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">ANSWER:  But — but anyway, from that, that was number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Number two 1s the —
QUESTION:  Excuse me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">QUESTION:  How mu — do you know how many people died in that — 1n that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">collision</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="444">February 19, 2013
ANSWER:  Yes, 20 — as I recall, there was 22. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Because I got a figure of 51 in my mind that combined the two crashes that happened the same week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="446">QUESTION:  And was this because of the intensity and the frequency and just the sheer number of bombing missions that were taking place, that they were — there were just too many in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">ANSWER:  Well, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">military aircraft</span> usually flew in formation, and the formation consisted of, let’s say — our formations consisted of 13 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> , but th-that means they weren’t too far apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And the weather was so bad that they cou — you couldn’t see. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">In other words, you just lost the sight, and somehow or other, two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> brushed together and — and caused an explosion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">ANSWER:  And that scattered them all over, you know, so then I give you an — a article about Bob Owens, the — our engineering officer that was — was big 1n all of our — our missions and so forth, so he — well, I'll follow that later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  Or no, he — IJ-I’ll pick that up now, because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Horsa glider</span> was a British made, all wood, but a very large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Instead of carrying only 15 paratroopers, they could carry 30.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">February 19, 2013
ANSWER:  Well, they had 29 in that, plus two pilots. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And —
QUESTION:  So that made 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  That makes a total of 31. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">The 31 plus the 22 made the 53 that sticks in my mind as far as the loss. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Anyway, the — he had told them, he had — they — they sent the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> in and he wa — he noted in inspection of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> that there was about a three inch space between the tail mounting and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fuselage</span> , where it’s supposed to be tight. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">The glue had — this was all glued together, it’s a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wood aircraft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Like this, glue had separated and he issued what they called a red tag. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And every one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Horsa gliders</span> on the base was red tagged. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">But Wing, next step up, decided that they had to have a practice run of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop car</span> — of 647 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> pulling a s — the c — this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">digger glider</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And so they assigned two 88" pilots, glider pilots to the task.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  Can I interrupt just for a second?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">QUESTION:  I just want to ma — establish that the manufacturer of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gliders</span> was British.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  But they had sold them to the Americans and this was now an American military operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">February 19, 2013
ANSWER:  It was part of our — our assigned — we didn’t pay any attention who — who furnished it, but we had a certain amount of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , certain number of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gliders</span> , certain number of CG-4 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gliders</span> , which is the smaller —
QUESTION:  Got it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  — certain — along with the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">They wanted a test to show the capability of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">C-47 aircraft</span> towing that fully loaded <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">glider</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">This fully loaded <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">glider</span> would go okay, even with that tail problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So they were able to fly the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gliders</span> into the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , but he said that the minute you take off, it probably will not be more than just a few seconds and that tail is gonna separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Well, just exactly like he forecast, the — the tail broke off when the — when the tu — the [indecipherable] <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">glider</span> was probably about a hundred feet in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And course, then they drove straight into a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">knoll</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I recall the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> had dove straight into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kno-knoll</span> , and every single one of those occupants was in the fr —

<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  — of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">glider</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I wasn’t there — I wasn’t certainly the first there, but they had removed the bodies and then I — hearing about the crash, I drove over to that also, which 1s in the same <span class="REGION">area</span> , in the same <span class="DLF">debris field</span> as the crash of the two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B-17s</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">February 19, 2013 And the guard — there was a guard assigned to it by then, and he says, well there was a — there’s some — a human hip or something like a — a big roast —
QUESTION:  Oh gosh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  — still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">They’d removed all the human remains, but they’d missed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So that’s — that’s number 30 some. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Anyway, but the thing that was so — so — so remarkable is seeing 13 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulances</span> , wi — each with four bodies of people that were highly trained, moving off the <span class="DLF">field</span> toward the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">QUESTION:  Oh my.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">ANSWER:  And that was imp — very impressive, I mean, in their own sort of way. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Those are things that were not relayed to the American public.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">QUESTION:  Were they co — were they considered secret, top secret? </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Could you speak about them to your relatives, to your wife?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  Oh, we couldn’t speak about anything, no, they — they took every one of our letters, and when they — when the relatives got them, there was a lot of black mark, cause they took out a lot of information, you could not mention anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  Highly, highly — they — they — they edited everything that went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">February 19, 2013

<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  Well, one step further, the man that tried to stop it, Bob Owens was on his way to a court martial, because he had ignored an order to allow the 88" pilots or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> to fly. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">The unfortunate thing is, they chose two fi— pilots from the 89" squadron, and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> from the 89" squadron. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">There’s now a memorial there to that particular thing that the prince — Princess Margaret was there at the dedication of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">But they got it a little wrong, I’m afraid they — they sh — I think they showed 88" pilots still on that marker, but it was only — it was actually 89".</span></p>

QUESTION:  Well, I’m amazed by how many details you remember, I really am. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">It’s a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  Well, you know, the whole picture never came to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Each one of these were separate little things, and I wrote about it a step at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I was going to use each one of these little things as a separate chapter in my book that I was writing — I was going to write. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">But lack of time and the fact that I’m still working, I’m still o-own my own business, I never got to write the book, but I didn’t want these details to be lost, and so —
QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  — it was just — back in those days it was just me doing one job and nothing big about it, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Nothing unusual about it, that’s what I was supposed to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  But then when I look at the whole picture, the ninth troop carrier order [indecipherable] 1,000 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , ordered, that the entire group of 1,000 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> be eq- equipped, or be given the information, taught the information, I also came up with a — an idea to extend the range where they — you could see the signal from farther out when they’re coming back, to try to find the <span class="DLF">airfield</span> in bad weather. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I was able to extend that by so-called piquing of the frequencies. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I don’t know now how I did it, but I did it back then. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">There — there were several things that the — right up to February 19, 2013 General Williams, who came to the base, and w — and — and interviewed everyone and so forth, and tried to figure out what all this fuss was about. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">They — he then ordered the entire — now comes the British — I don’t recall I — but it’s British Engineering Association that was very big, and they did design a lot of beautiful equipment, so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">But they kind of took credit for the fact that this — these things happened, and they ordered the RAF and every — every part of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fleet</span> to be using the same equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And so it’s just recently that I could see the whole picture and had an interest in seeing the whole picture, that I finally decided that this was a lot more than I had ever given credit for, that every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> that flew in the ETO, European theater of operation at that time, u-utilized these advancements.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  Well, that’s —
ANSWER:  Well then, because of that, the C-40s — the 438s performed flawlessly in the invasion of Normandy. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">They lost no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , they missed no targets, and the radio — the radar on all their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> worked perfectly, and they can — come back and eventually got the only st — unit citation ever received by a troop carrier group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  Wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  And groups were very — kind of tiny, there’s dozens and dozens of groups, so we — we were kind of singled out for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Based on that, I finally realized that what I had done probably helped a lot to our getting that citation. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">February 19, 2013

<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  I’m also impressed that it sounds like innovation was something that was allowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  Oh, defin —
QUESTION:  Innovation was something that was encouraged within the structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="537">ANSWER:  Encourage — oh, I got to give the upper level a lot of credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Anything they saw that would improve the chances of a man getting back, and his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> and his crew getting back safely, was encouraged and certainly adopted, if it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And later they — I lost my train of thought for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  Something about — about the — the innovation being encouraged.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it — it — it — well, I wou — I would — I was trying to think of a certain instance where it was very, very easily — oh, th-th-the — this outcome was, of course, of course, the outcome was that probably untold number of lives were saved by pilots that could find their way back and didn’t — di-didn’t have to <span class="DLF">ditch</span> , or February 19, 2013 didn’t have to crash land or — or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So then I told myself, you know, I never killed anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I never had to shoot someone, that’s terrible, that’s hard to live with. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I never done anything, but I believe that I’ve saved lots of lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And that — since that time I’ve had no ma — nightmares, I’ve slept very soundly. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I have no regrets for anything — any judgment I made or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So that — that’s —

ANSWER:  — which was a big mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Operation mark — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Market Basket</span> , I went along with my friend that was [indecipherable] landing pilot, I went along with him because the CEO thought it’d be nice to have more than one navigator in the squadron, in case the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> got shot down. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So he asked if I’d go along as a wing navigator.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  And Operation Market Basket was what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  It was where they tried to save all these <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">A <span class="DLF">Bridge</span> Too Far is probably more im — memorable.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  It’s on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine river</span> , where they tried to — want to shorten the war by saving the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> so they didn’t have to rebuild <span class="DLF">bridges</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  And that particular mission was to preserve those <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , that — and so that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , Patton’s <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , when they got there, couldn’t blast across without having to build <span class="DLF">pontoon bridges</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">ANSWER:  He was moving very fast, and we were terribly important in the fact that he was able to move so fast because a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">C-47</span> carried paratroopers into areas of drop. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Then, on the way back, they — they came back and picked up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gliders</span> and they threw it — flew them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Then they came back and they flew into — like I took a mission into February 19, 2013 — on D-Day plus six, we flew into Omaha Beach, and we flew into a—a-—a <span class="DLF">landing strip</span> that had been cut hastily in the bluffs above <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha Beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And we landed there with flight nurses aboard, and picked up the terribly wounded — most terribly wounded of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Omaha Beach</span> , and we just had a constant stream of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> flying in and out, and bringing those people back to <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And while I was there, I stepped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> , trying to help with the loading of the — of the litter patients and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And a captain on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , in the infantry yelled at me, get back in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> , because you s — have greens on. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">The green — I didn’t have the camouflage on, and he says, there’s snipers in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">So, of course, I was forced back into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">But that — I’m telling that because the — the — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">C-47</span> done so many other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">On [indecipherable] rush across, he outrun all of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tankers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">He’d run out of gas and then couldn’t go any further. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Then we started loading up 6,000 pounds of gasoline on each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> and flew a constant stream of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and flew a constant stream of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> right behind Patton’s army as he raced across Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">We’d land in — in pastures, we'd land on <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And this — these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were so powerful, they could pull themselves out of mud.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">QUESTION:  Wow. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">February 19, 2013
ANSWER:  So they flew supplies, gasoline supplies and then loaded the medical patients, had litters that come down from the side on <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , they loaded the litter patients up and got out of there, and back to <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I’m trying to say that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> itself was such a big story, what it could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And — and then, naturally, it was a natural carrier, so thousands and thousands and thousands of displaced people and survivors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and survivors of the — of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camps</span> , very close together, they — in one — the <span class="REGION">area</span> we went in, the slave laborers and — and the ovens were right close by because they had to use the si — ovens to dispose of the slave laborers that was too — too weak to work any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And then they had the <span class="BUILDING">V-2 factory</span> underground right there, you know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="595">QUESTION:  And did you — did the —
ANSWER:  No, it was a total failure, and that total failure, Montgomery talked General Eisenhower into doing this, thinking it — it would s — cut time off the war, really it — it added a year to the war, because Patton’s <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> didn’t have the gas that we were flying in. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">We had to fly to save <span class="DLF">bridges</span> instead of flying the gasoline into Patton where he could keep going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">QUESTION:  Got it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">ANSWER:  The war would have ended one year earlier, had it not been for that mistake.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">QUESTION:  So, when you’re finally — the war does end, had you had any knowledge or contact of what — what it is that — that you eventually saw, or was the — were these flights that took place — I’m no — I’m not phrasing this correctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Let’s go this way: what’s the first time that you flew on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">C-47s</span> , where it had contact with the survivors of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , the survivors from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slave labor camps</span> , and displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Set that up for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">February 19, 2013
ANSWER:  It was in — it was June the se — around the f-first of June and the second part of May of 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">QUESTION:  So the war had ended?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">ANSWER:  The war had ended by then, and we had lots of transport available and these — the need for getting those people out of there as fast as possible, was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">So —
QUESTION:  How did you kn — did you know who — what you were going to be meeting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">QUESTION:  At that point did you know — what is 1t — what did you know about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> before you even got there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">ANSWER:  We knew we — by that time there was a lot of information out. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And so — I mean, months and months earlier we knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And — and that was, of course, one of the great reasons that — and I’m sure that it was on everyone’s mind that if — if we don’t k — if we don’t knock the head off that monster, that these people, there will be nobody left. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So we were aware of it, and we were very shocked by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Of course, we were very shocked by it, way before June.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And where did you take off from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">ANSWER:  We took off from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amiens</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">We had moved just right — just before that, we’d moved into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amiens</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in an old World War II battlefield. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">We had the old World War I— I’m sorry, not two, one, World War I, correction. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">We had the February 19, 2013 <span class="DLF">trenches</span> from World War I all — all around us, virtually, and there was this level patch of ground that they laid down the <span class="DLF">airstrip</span> , made of steel — interlocking steel sections. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And we had to be careful, cause if we went off our general area of operations, there was unexploded ordinance around, and people were getting — still getting killed from World War I armaments.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">QUESTION:  Oh my goodness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">ANSWER:  And then the — the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> were f — full of nice small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">birch trees</span> , beautiful <span class="ENV_FEATURES">birch trees</span> , and I got some pictures that eventually the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> will get. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And there’s a picture of a 88" and everything, made out of birch. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Kind of a big <span class="DLF">entrance</span> -like to our — our — our Amiens base. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So that — that’s where we took off from, and the idea was to be closer to carrying troo — gasoline with the various <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Patton went so fast that the — his big express that they had designed to keep gasoline flowing to him, just couldn’t — couldn’t keep up, and he was being slowed down, and they got together and just a day or two later they come up with the idea of flying them in by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop carrier</span> and flying out the wounded.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">QUESTION:  Okay, so when you were taking off from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amiens</span> , were y — did you take off with gas and came back with people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, it was primarily to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">We went there empty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">February 19, 2013
ANSWER:  No, we probably carried supplies in. [</span><span class="sentence" id="631">indecipherable] I don’t recall, we — I -- we almost never flew empty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  And we knew that that <span class="REGION">area</span> was being liberated and so forth, so we knew the need probably would be great. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I’m sure we took medical supplies at least, and things of that sort in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">QUESTION:  So, do you recall how long the flight was, when you landed, where you landed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">ANSWER:  We landed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halle</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="644">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">February 19, 2013

ANSWER:  They walked with — some with — with canes and — and some — we had to help some of them in getting aboard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , cause there was a step down, kind of little <span class="DLF">ladder</span> that come up into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and so they had to be helped — most of them had to be helped into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And then — then again, water and so forth, important things that they needed, we supplied during the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And candy bars, but we had to be very careful, because they gave us orders not to feed them, because in feeding them too rich a diet — they had to have a special diet — these are little details I can recall — special diet, and then they were fed, instead of gallons of water at a time, you know, just small amounts of water at a time and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So — but it — it was very pathetic, and the — and the most — the most memorable part of the trip is when I made the announcement — had to go back among them, made the announcement that we were just crossing the <span class="DLF">French border</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">That’s where I can’t — to this day I—I can’t talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">To this day I can’t talk about it without breaking down. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">The joy, seeing smiles on these ke — skeletons. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">When [indecipherable] give me a lot of thanks that I had never b — had not been on the other side of that <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">But that’s the — that’s the main memory of that — that — we never flew any women to my knowledge that — you probably couldn’t tell the difference between then anyway, but — but that was very difficult.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="840">ANSWER:  I never give — I didn’t have nightmares like so many did. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">We were able to look to the future and say okay, where do we go from here? </span><span class="sentence" id="842">I decided to get into business rather than — rather than take the G.I. Bill of Right — bill that sent so many people to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And so we finally went across the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and — and Is — was able — we were staying at — we ha-had a destination of my uncle’s <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="844">My uncle, his name is Callie(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And they lived on — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santa Monica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846">So we came in February 19, 2013 with him, and he was a painter, and I spent several days painting. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And so I started making money just about soon as I got back, because our — our pay was delayed again. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">By that time I was a captain and — and the pay wasn’t too bad from the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">Anyway, leading beyond that as fast as we can, we received a lot of the four engine air — U.S. Air Force planes back to <span class="DLF">Douglas aircraft field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">We re — we started to renovate them, I was involved in — I knew wiring and so forth, so I was involved in the <span class="REGION">electrical side</span> , and we spent several — I spent almost a year with them, and about 1946 — ’47. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Meantime our dau — we had a daughter born in 1946, Beverly — Beverly June, and she is now retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And also working, they’ve had to call her back. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">She was a nurse at University of Colorado medical center. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Anyway, going on from that, in 1949, I opened my first business, which was a ra-radi — a radio-television operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And I spent quite a number of years with — with the star community like Clark Gable, and all these big stars, including this Disney — I mean, including the gr — the — Jack Carson, John Wayne, and many, many, I mean, we had the world’s [indecipherable] release for signed photographs.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="862">ANSWER:  And later we opened B and D Electronics. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">B and D being Beatrice and Dutch, B and D electronics. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And we handled the entire 13 <span class="REGION">western states</span> and distribution of electronic parts for television and radio and — and accessories. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And then I eventually wanted to see more of what goes on in the real world, so I stepped out into various jobs that led up to me designing a anti-collision device in the 60s, and I think it was 1965 when the — the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jet aircraft</span> flying passengers came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Two — two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">TWA planes</span> had crashed over the gand — over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Grand Canyon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And I said, what a terrible, terrible problem, and what a terrible thing to happen, when there was a solution.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">ANSWER:  And again, I used what was available in my radar training and so forth, same — same equipment, same stuff, and I designed an anti-collision device. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And — and it — believe it or not, 1t was just the same basic idea; why not take what’s already proven by war, by everything and turn it into something to save lives? </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Anyway, there again, after m — drawing the design kind of roughly, I decided before I waste any more time that I would go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and meet with the — the FAA, and so they set up an appointment a half an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And we got — my — my brother then met me at that point, and — cause he was a pilot that had not finished his training February 19, 2013 before he was sent overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And he met me, and we met with the FAA, and I showed the the design, I showed them the — where — where I had had success of that in Europe, it had actually worked, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And the half hour meeting turned into four hours, the whole afternoon was taken, and at the end they says, look, we know — we’re pretty sure that this will probably save 95 percent of our collisions, he says, but unless you get to a hundred percent, there’s no way we can ever get it through Congress, or get it approved. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">So — and I — and I also met with people at M- Magnavox Corporation, a big electronics firm. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">They al-also designed a system. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">So I had communications with them, and they had the same — same luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Eventually I — I made a ri —a di—a revelation — or I made a disclosure to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bendix Aircraft</span> , and I says, here I’m disclosing this, what can you do with it? </span><span class="sentence" id="879">You have more power than any little one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Well, they di— had the same results, they said yes, 1t would work, and so all I got was the satisfaction of knowing the thing would work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">ANSWER:  Beyond that, I got into my own business. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">I — I joined as a chairman of a public electronics firm that made specialized cathode ray tubes, the display device that they use in air traffic control. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">We design little tiny tubes that they use on helicopter pilot sites — air — gun sites. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And we designed — we also designed a — a ground radar February 19, 2013 type of system that would cut the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> down, I don’t remember how many feet, but then show the side of it in layers, for finding oil.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">QUESTION:  Wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">ANSWER:  And that was a sale — we made a sale of that device to Brown Root, a division of [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And that — let’s see — lost my train of thought, what was the last —
QUESTION:  Oh, you were talking about some of the business ventures and — and — and the —
ANSWER:  Oh yes, I was talking about that one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">ANSWER:  And this was — had to have a silver oxide type of — of paper that flowed past a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">heater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="891">The heater design was — had to be very even heat over a s — a stretch of heater element, and the paper flowed over it, 1t was heat developed. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And the fact that I had worked at two heat — specialized heat manufacturers as vice president of — of new — new product design and so forth — two separate ones, I had a lot of knowledge about that particular product, and we were able to solve that problem, and that was sold to Brown and Root, where it went from there, that’s where my — my memory trailed off, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="893">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Did you may — so it sounds like you were both in business ventures, and also inventing. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">February 19, 2013
ANSWER:  Well, the inventing was kind of a — again, a side — a side product of — for the heat companies I invented a couple of devices for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="896">One to guard against reversal of the polarity of the power coming out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> from the <span class="DLF">dock</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Cause if it was the wrong reverse, 1 — the — it would eat up the prop and everything else, it had to be the right di — the right polarity. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And I designed a de-device that would automatically reverse it in the device, rather than have — have the damage. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">The other one was — what the heck was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="900">The other one was pretty interesting, but I can’t remember the details.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="901">QUESTION:  It’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">If you do, we’ll talk about it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="976">ANSWER:  His job was to mislead the Germans into where we were going to land at almost every landing. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">His job at the specific <span class="REGION">southern France</span> invasion was to use about 10 of his 12 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">PT boats</span> in a squadron, they were equipped with very powerful ma — amplifiers and loudspeakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And he would race along the sh — it’d race along the <span class="DLF">shore</span> to about 40 knots, or 50 miles an hour, so very fast in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And they would turn on these — these things as if there were 10,000 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">Very, very loud and very deceiving. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">At the same time he’d have a fl — a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> flying and dropping what they call <span class="DLF">window</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="983">ANSWER: <span class="DLF"> Window</span> is strips of tin foil. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">And it — the strips of tinfoil would look, on the German radar, like a whole big fleet of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">And they were all headed for this — this fake <span class="DLF">landing site</span> he designed. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">He also designed rubber paratroopers of different sizes, make it look like there was a lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">They were inflatable, and then they dropped those from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> at some point, that looked like there’s the place it’s gonna be, so the Germans would move all their reinforcements over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">February 19, 2013 Which then, of course, made the — the real invasion point much safer for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">Specially <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">C-47s</span> , that did not have an ounce of firepower on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">It was very vulnerable, so —
QUESTION:  So, did this happen simultaneously as the Normandy invasion or just prior, or —

<p><span class="sentence" id="1002">ANSWER:  — the real thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">The reason for me being there is I had to man that light, and we did it on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">PT boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">But the real tr — the fake paratroopers was his design.</span></p>
