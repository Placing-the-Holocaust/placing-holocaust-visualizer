<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Could you please tell us your name and where and when you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Henry G., G for George, Plitt. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> in 1918 and that, of course, was late in the year that year, just two weeks after the Armistice for World War I.
QUESTION:  And where were you educated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I started in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , and I went to <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> there, and one year at DeWitt Clinton High School, after which my family sent me to a <span class="BUILDING">military academy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanton</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staunton</span> , <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">It's spelled <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staunton</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">It's pronounced Stanton and there I began my military career.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  And you stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">military academy</span> through the end of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Well, I graduated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staunton</span> in 1935 at which time I went to <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span> and there I went in the ROTC, so again we've got another three or four years, three years of military and I was eligible to become an officer by then with six years of military under my belt, but I wasn't old enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">In those days you had to be twenty-one to be...
QUESTION:  An officer...
ANSWER:  A lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">So that began my relationship with the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Now I was in <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> in <span class="BUILDING">St. Lawrence University</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , and at this time...it was getting close to 1940...it was in '38 and '39, and my family managed through an organization called HIAS to bring into this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> some of my relatives who were in the <span class="REGION">German occupied areas</span> and when [...when I heard their story, I just made up my mind that all this was...one man was responsible for all this and his name was Hitler and somehow or other I wanted to kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Now that sounds terrible in the light of today's world, but at that time when you heard those horror stories, you couldn't do anything but want to destroy this person who was responsible for it, so I switched my allegiance in the army to parachute troops because at that time parachute troops were trained to blow up <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , blow up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , drop behind the <span class="DLF">lines</span> , assassinate, execute and all this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">But during our period of training, it was very strange but many, many people came into parachute troops and before the training was over, we suddenly had ourselves a a regiment of men and now the tactics were not going to be the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">The regiment, incidentally, grew into divisions, and by the time we jumped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> there were three divisions that went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">There was the 10Ist, the 82nd and the British 36th Airborne, so you can see that the idea of jumping behind the <span class="DLF">lines</span> and killing Hitler was a long way from potential fruition. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">It just couldn't happen that way, so that's that's an answer to your question and when did I get in the army or how or why.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Now we won't focus on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I know you have a very interesting aspect of your military career in terms of the landing at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Could you briefly tell us a little bit about that...what...what exactly your role was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  Well, all...all I can tell you is that the only reason...it was a quirk of fate...the only reason that I ended up with the first group to jump in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> 1s the man that we had selected as our pathfinder, the day before during the period Eisenhower delayed for twenty-four hours, we had a chance to go up and see what he had done, and we were very dissatisfied with it and my colonel said to me on the way back, Plitt, I want you to go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Take the pathfinder detachment in and I'll meet you on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and put a DSC on your neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So I...
QUESTION:  Distinguished Service Cross?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So I didn't have any choice anyway, but the point is that that put me among...we had three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> loads going in, the pathfinders, a total of eighteen people per <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> for a total of fifty-four people. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And now the actual flight itself over <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was nothing but when we got to the <span class="REGION">English Channel</span> , we went down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> and there were some very exciting moments when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> at <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> were flashing the V for victory sign to us right over...right over head and then when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span> we pulled up to five hundred feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Imagine...up to five hundred feet and we went along the <span class="DLF">line</span> , the <span class="DLF">road</span> that we had all been briefed so carefully on and studied so long, running from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montberg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valone</span> ...from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montberg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Valone</span> on down to St. Mere-Eglise and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carentan</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And when we got over our <span class="DLF">drop zone</span> , boom...there it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Now if you want to know what went through my mind, I was just as scared as any human being 01:02: could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Here I was jumping into Festung (fortress) Europe, which was a Nazi dominated <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , German soldiers, and I had an H on my dog tag. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Now the H on my dog tag stood for Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">At that time the army put your religion on your dog tags and they did it only so that if you need last rites or what have you, they know what you are and what you aren't, and they only had three categories. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">There was P for Protestant, C for Catholic and H for Hebrew or Jewish, and so there I was, all alone, in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , German- occupied, so the first thing I did (coughing)...excuse me...in an attempt to get mobile or as mobile as I could, was to scrap the throwaway things that were weighing me down, such as a gas mask and such as binoculars and such as extra rounds of ammunition, and suddenly I got so I could move around with a great degree of ease, and during this period I was able to pick up a hundred and one men. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Strangely enough, we were the 101st Airborne. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I picked up a hundred and one men and we attacked the gun position, which was the division mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Now the reason we did that is that we were supposed to be on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> for thirty minutes, and after that hearing our own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> come in, we would put the lights on. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">That's what we jumped for...the pathfinders...put the lights on and guide the rest of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> in. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">For a long time, it got to be very thin and tight and for a long time I thought maybe Eisenhower has canceled again, in which case we got to stay here for twenty-four more hours and sweat it out, or...and before the or really had a chance to take hold, we could hear the drone of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> coming over. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">For our whole, the first part of the mission, the pathfinder mission was worthless, because these were new pilots who had never flown in combat before and when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">anti-aircraft</span> started coming up at them, they broke from formation. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">They dropped troops in the Channel. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They dropped them all the way north to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span> and all the way south to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carentan</span> , and so that part of the mission just wasn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  But you still were one of the first ones to...
ANSWER:  Well, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I was in the first fifty-four.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  I want to move now to your role in a very important historical moment that you had and that's in the capture of...1n the apprehension and the capture of two major figures in Nazi...the Nazi rule of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in the destruction of the Jews, and I understand the first one you captured was Robert Ley.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Could you tell us about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Yeah, it's a very interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We had an arrangement with the Burgermeisters of the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , that if they had any known what would later become termed as war criminals, in their <span class="REGION">area</span> , they were to notify us. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">If they intended to hold their job as Burgermeister, they better do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And so we got a call one night. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I don't know who was on the board...got a call from a Burgermeister telling us about this man that was living in a certain <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and we entered the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that he was supposed to occupy and he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">He was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and the minute we came in the <span class="DLF">door</span> , he reached for a pill on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">night table</span> , and one of my boys knocked it out of his hand, and then he said he didn't know why we were bothering him. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">He was a professor, a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">His name was Disselbruger (ph) and he...what can I tell you...he claimed to have...he never was a Nazi, knew nothing about Nazism and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Now I have to take you back for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">When VE Day came around, which was May the 8th, my particular unit of the 101st Airborne was in an <span class="REGION">area</span> occupied by 13,000 SS troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Now there we were, two thousand, now in charge of.</span><span class="sentence" id="57">,,these people had surrendered, so we took <span class="DLF">blocks</span> where they put their weapons, and <span class="DLF">blocks</span> where they did this, but in order to control these 13,000 people, we had to get MP's...that's military police...from their own units. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We...we...we just didn't have the manpower to do this, so we did that, and in my <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> was a full colonel Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">At that time I was only a cap...I was a major. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">In our <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> there was a full colonel Nazi, and when I walked in with Disselbruger, he clicked his heels, popped to attention and said Heil. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Now how in the hell can a school teacher have a full colonel do this, so I called <span class="BUILDING">division headquarters</span> and I said I'm sending this guy up to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And I did, and he turned out to be Robert Ley, the Minister of Labor, the guy who sent people to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">That's the Robert Ley story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  That's a fascinating story. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So his subordinate gave him away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Well, yeah, you could call a full colonel his 01:04: subordinate, but once you knew that he was senior to a full colonel, you knew you had something. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But I didn't know who he was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Now you also had a very important role in the apprehension and the capture of Julius Streicher, who was the leading propagandist, anti-Semitic propagandist for the Nazi movement...
ANSWER:  Well, that that was a more solitary role because I got him by myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Could you tell us about how that came about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  We also got a tip that there was a a high ranking Nazi living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Widering</span> (ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and his name we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I thought it was Heinrich Himmler from the description, but I didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> of my own and I didn't have an interpreter of my own at the time, so I borrowed another guy's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and his driver and the three of us went up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> to this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , chalet, chateau, whatever you want to call it, and I entered, my 45 in hand, and I went upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">There was a man sitting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> with an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">easel</span> to his right painting the opposite Alp, and I asked him his name and he told me Joseph Seeler (ph), and I said where's your identification papers, and he reached right in back and he pulled out an identification paper made out to the name of Joseph Seeler. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Now it didn't hit me quite that fast that this was Julius Streicher, and I began asking him things about Himmler, because I thought I had the wrong guy, and he said he knew nothing about politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He was a painter. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">He knew nothing about anything that had to do with what I was interested in and then I don't know why I said, and what about Julius Streicher, and he said: "Ja, der bin Ich.” </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Now I got that only from the J S on his work papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  JS?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  Joseph Seeler was Julius Streicher. "</span><span class="sentence" id="79">Ja, der bin Ich", which when translated into English reads yes, that's who I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Now we had no further interrogation. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">In the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> on the way, he and I were in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I had my gun riding his ribs so nothing was going to happen there. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">He wasn't going to jump out or commit suicide or anything, and I said to him...this is the only interrogation he got from me...I said to him: "Sind Sie der Streicher der war gegendie Juden?", </span><span class="sentence" id="84">which when translated means, are you the Streicher who was against the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And he very calmly said: "Ja, der bin Ich", which meant yes, that's who I am, but he might just as well have said so what. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I mean he was arrogant to the very end, so much so that when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berchtesgarten</span> ...oh, I'm sorry... stopped at my <span class="BUILDING">regimental headquarters</span> to notify them I was bringing him in and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bertchesgarten</span> was about forty miles away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">When I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bertchesgarten</span> , as he was getting out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> , I booted him a little bit so that accelerate his departure, and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was loaded with reporters and this, that and the other, and one reporter came up to me and he said, you know, you just killed the greatest story of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I said how. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">He said can you imagine if a guy named Kohn or Goldberg or Levy had captured this arch-anti-Semite, what a great story it would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I said why. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">He said because a Jew would be doing this, and I told him I'm Jewish, and that's when the microphones came into my face and the cameras started clicking away and things started to happen that changed the rest of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Did you have any chance to interrogate him further or after that...
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">They took him. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I took him to division headquarters. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They took him on up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> where the army interrogation team was. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">When I say army that's a division of like a regiment or battalion army, and that's where those people were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  How did you feel capturing Ley and even and capturing Streicher?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Well, with Ley I just felt it was a part of my job and because there was no direct relationship between Ley and Streicher and between Ley and and what was going on in Europe and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time, but with Streicher there was a very direct relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">With Ley I didn't even go to division with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I sent him up with a couple of my men because I didn't...we didn't know then that it was Ley either, you know, but I sent him up with a couple of my men and with Streicher there was a very personal feeling about the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I can tell you myself not killing him from time to time when I had the opportunity, but I had two other people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and war or not war you just don't kill people who surrendered, so that's the story of Julius Streicher.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  That's an important story. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">You also had participated I guess earlier than this in the entry into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">That was...
QUESTION:  Could you tell us about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Well, that's...that's a moment that will will live forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The most outstanding moment of this whole thing, and I'll never forget the word was as we got in there and it was a horrible sight...everything was, <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> they lived in, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnaces</span> that they were burned in, and which incidentally were 01:06: <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> and as we got there, moving up into this <span class="REGION">area</span> , one of the men I was with said look at those <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> , and another officer standing next to him said no, it's <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">That's the plural for <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I'll never forget that because that whole moment was just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">These people were sitting on <span class="DLF">stoops</span> and <span class="DLF">porches</span> and on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Their bodies were totally emaciated. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Their legs were swollen. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was...1t was an unbelievable time and the very same date that we went through stands there today because I've been back and it's just...it's a moment that is very difficult to describe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  Do you remember the exact day on which you entered?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  No, I don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I remember May 8th, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I've got those dates, but I can't give you the exact day, but I can tell you that about two weeks before...maybe ten days before the 8th of May, I saw people walking on the <span class="DLF">road</span> wearing what we later found out was the uniform of the inmates of the the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but I had never seen that before...a pajama looking thing with a blue and a grey. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And I said what the hell is this. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">They got another army here we don't know about. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They were walking along the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and this is in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> , but as you got into <span class="REGION">areas</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and what have you, you were getting into the areas of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and how and why they were out I can't tell you, but they were out there and not with a guard, because the guard would have been a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We would have shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">We would have had a fire fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  Had you been prepared by the army or anything you had read or information for what you would see in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  No way. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I knew of the horror things that had happened through the cousins of mine that came back from there in 1940 and '39, but they didn't describe <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They didn't know anything about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">What they could describe was how a <span class="DLF">store window</span> would be broken, a person would be taken off the <span class="DLF">street</span> , 1f you were a doctor you couldn't practice, if you were a teacher you couldn't teach, if you wrote a book it wouldn't be published...those things I knew, but I didn't know anything about these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  The soldiers you were with and since you were an officer, the American soldiers you were with, did did they understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Did you have...did you feel that you understood in a different way because you were a Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Was there something you could translate...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I think this thing was so horrible that it really didn't matter what you were, what your religious background was, this thing was so horrendous that no matter who you were or what you were, it was going to plague you. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">You see, one of the reasons for the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> and one of the reasons for the expression that the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> use frequently now is "Never Again," and I have to tell you that anyone of my troops that went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> with us would not become a parent of a skinhead or a neo-Nazi or any one of those things, because what they say could never be duplicated in history and hopefully never will be, it was so horrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  Turning to your return to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , were you able to translate, tell people when you came back, what you had seen so that they could understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Did they believe you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  We didn't...we didn't dwell on that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">When I came back, obviously I didn't have a civilian job. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I was still in the service, until January of '46, but the B'nai B'rith and the Anti-Defamation League had me going out to lunches and dinners to talk and it was a very propitious subject at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">The war had just ended and we focused on the Julius Streicher story and never on the other facets that we're talking about today, so...and we also talked about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> , but we just never got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachaus</span> of the world or any of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">It 1t didn't come up so I didn't paint that picture as I have just tried to do for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">It was...the picture was horrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  Something that you will always remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  And everybody else that saw it will too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  How did it shape or change...did it change your life? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Did it affect your life and your subsequent career?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  How did you find him? </span><span class="sentence" id="148">How did you...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Well, you you began to get things from Burgermeisters mostly and tips that you were getting from other Germans who were fearful of being...we we we went into a bogey (ph) wheel factory and we found people in there that were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">It was...you had to take a finiculaire to get up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We we just spent days and days and days looking for these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I didn't leave there until after September and this is May 8 we're talking about, so that lasted ...that lasted quite a while.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Did the army object at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They didn't object, and they were delighted when I would bring these people in, but he wouldn't... my own commanding officer wouldn't let me use American troops.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  So you left...you left Europe in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">You returned to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I didn't come back until later than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">In September I left the <span class="REGION">Berchtesgarten area</span> where we were picking these people up and then I went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wiesbaden</span> where Eisenhower's <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> were and I mentioned earlier that I went to <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> and I became the law member of a general court which 1s like...the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> itself 1s like a jury and the law member is the one who advises them on the law, and then I stayed there until the end of the year and then I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  When you returned to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , did you tell people about what you had seen? </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Did you talk at all about...I know you tended to emphasize Streicher and your involvement with the capture of Streicher, but did your family ask you about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Did you talk about that at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Oh, I'm sure I did but I can't recall specific instances at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  Now to go back to my earlier question. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">How did this whole event affect you? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">How did you feel coming back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  Well, you have to...you have to realize that there's a camaraderie and a fraternalism in the service that doesn't exist anywhere that I know of in civilian life, particularly troops who have been engaged in combat together and who have survived, and there was a resentment but a friendly resentment from all of my friends because as we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , there was a headline in the paper...17,000 troops returning. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Included among them is Henry Plitt, the man who captured Julius Streicher. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And so out of 17,000, they named one name and the guys started to get pretty irked with that and when I got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , I was interviewed by the press and they asked what my post-war plans were, and I said I would like to take a contingent down to <span class="REGION">South America</span> and find Hitler because I'm sure he's alive down there, and I figured this was going to turn into another job. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">At that point I didn't know what the future held for me, but of course 1t was pooh-poohed and it never happened, but it was another headline in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , so we treated it very lightly. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We treated it very lightly. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It was kind of a fun thing except I left out a whole segment here. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> on what was known as the hero's tour. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Those were people who were highly decorated and what have you, and their mission was to sell war bonds. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Now in those days we didn't finance a war from taxes or from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We financed the war from our own people 1:10: putting up the money to fight the war, and so I spent time here and my assignment was the Paramount Theater circuit and I met the president of the company and the vice president and all those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">They were very lovely people, and one of them said to me if you come back in one piece, call us. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Now my speeches for the ADL and the B'nai B'rith and what have you, had gotten kind of tired and I called Paramount and they said you're going to be the first executive trainee that we put to work post-war, and if you read Leonard Goldenson...he was the former chairman of the board of ABC...if you read his book called "Beating the Odds," he tells the story of how I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paramount</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Now that was in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">In 1973 I bought half of that theater chain and in 1978 I bought the rest of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And that's what Streicher had to do for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - PAUSE TECHNICAL CONVERSATION - TAPE DISTORTED END OF SIDE A
QUESTION:  You made a big leap from entering working for <span class="BUILDING">Paramount</span> to buying out their chain. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Can you fill us in briefly a little on some of the highlights of that that interim period? </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Here you were a young war hero...
ANSWER:  Well, what what actually happened (cough) is that I was supposed to be a trainee and I was supposed to learn all there was to know about theater operation, construction, projection, sound, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">with the idea in mind that I would go back to Europe and I would begin to put together deals for Paramount to become as important in Europe as they were here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">What actually happened is during the period of my training, I ingratiated myself...not intentionally...I didn't suck up to this guy, but I ingratiated myself with a man by the name of E. B. Richards in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Orleans</span> who was the big bad wolf of our industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">He was hated. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">He was feared. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">He was everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And I didn't know how important he was and the first night that I met him, I was living in...they call it...not the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> but a <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> where he ran this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for managers...and I was living in the <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> and I got back in and I was looking around. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I saw a light somewhere and I went toward the light and it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span> and I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I took a couple of pieces of fruit out to eat and I heard a voice <span class="NPIP">inside</span> saying, who is that. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And he sent a man who was with him out and the man asked me to come in and I walked in and he said, oh you're the pencil-pusher from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> that they sent down here, aren't you. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And I said if you consider six years of active service in the army and parachute troops qualifying me as a pencil-pusher, I'll have it your way, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Now I never realized nobody ever crossed this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I mean he was powerful. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">There are some great stories about him and I'm going to digress for a minute and give you two of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Number one, when a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> manager would put signs up and where...you call them 8 x 10 photographs...and they were too low, he would go into that <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and he would get down on his stomach in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span> and look at the sign and get back up and say to the manager, gee that's great. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I hope all the rest of your audience 1s willing to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">That was one of his stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">The other one which is even more important is that <span class="BUILDING">Paramount</span> at one time wanted to put <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cash registers</span> into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">concession booths</span> , <span class="REGION">areas</span> , and E. B. Richards resented this. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">He wasn't going to have any part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So Leonard Goldensen who was then heading the theater division, but he really wasn't over E. B. because E. B. was a partner and Leonard was an employee but even though he was a head of a division, E. B. took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and he went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Orleans</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and he got there and he walked into the <span class="BUILDING">New York Paramount</span> and he bought a Hershey bar, which in those days was five cents, and he gave the girl a $20 bill, and when she turned around to ring up his sale, he swooped everything off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> into his hat, took his change and he went upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Now the <span class="BUILDING">Paramount Theater</span> was in the <span class="BUILDING">Paramount Building</span> where our <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">He went upstairs to Leonard's office and after they exchanged pleasantries, he said to Leonard, say Lennie, you running a sale downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And Goldensen said no, why Rich, what are you talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">He says look what I bought for a nickel and he threw the whole damn thing on his...so this is the kind of man 01:12: this was. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">If you remember the hucksters with Clark Gable and the big fat guy who said straw in the wind, opened the <span class="DLF">window</span> and threw his hat out...that was E. B. Richards type. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Any way, he became my mentor for a while and Goldensen...in 1950 the Federal Government split the <span class="BUILDING">studios</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> and Goldensen at that time on behalf of Paramount was out all over the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> buying up these chains, and he bought Richard's chain but it was to take...this was in May...but it was to take effect the 3rd of January and after he got back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he began scratching his head and saying gees, what will I have by the 3rd of January. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">He could move everything out. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">He'll have a circuit of his own, so he called Richards and he said I would like to send a representative down there between now and the 3rd. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Rich said OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">You've got one man in the company I'll take. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He's a northerner but we don't have any disregard for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">It was Henry Plitt. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">So off I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Orleans</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I had a very hectic period of time between the time I got there in July and the following January 3rd because I was walking on two sides of a <span class="DLF">track</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I had to...my responsibility was to Paramount but at the same time I was ostensibly an employee of Paramount Richards, so it was a pretty tough thing and when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pensacola</span> , Leonard came down on a trip and I said you know, Leonard, I don't have an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">If I wore a hat, I wouldn't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hang it. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">What is my future here. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">He said you're the heir apparent, and that was enough for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Three years later I took over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  Now a major portion of your life in addition, of course, to your professional career and your impact in the entertainment industry, has been charitable work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  What got you...how did you get involved in...particularly in your...has it any relationship to your experiences during the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Does it...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  Initially no. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Subsequently yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">My my real initial involvement in charity work was in 1949 I was then kind of general manager of the Richards, ex-Richards circuit, now Paramount, and Leonard Goldensen again who had a cerebral palsy daughter asked that we in our <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> cooperate in fund raising and I got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> to run on my screen, but I couldn't find anybody to make the collections so...because it was Mother's Day that Sunday...so instead of continuing to seek people who said no, I can't go because it's Mother's Day, I called a meeting with an ad for the cerebral palsy parents in <span class="REGION">Orleans Parish</span> , and they came to the meeting and because they couldn't leave their kids alone at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the kids were with them, and I saw these kids and I have to tell you that it wasn't <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> by any matter or means, but it was a heavy sympathy factor to see these kids that just didn't have appropriate treatment, didn't have appropriate diagnostic work, if the diagnosis was right they didn't have the disciplines to do it because it could have been dental, it could have been orthopedic, it could have been any number of things, and they just didn't have the doctors for it and not only that, they couldn't diagnosis it, so I kind of fell in love with that, and in short order I took over the organization and then I became the president of the Cerebral Palsy Association of New Orleans, subsequently Cerebral Palsy Association of Louisiana, then Regional Vice President of the national organization covering the South, and during all this, I would travel to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and I would meet with interested people and parents and I would get them going. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Later on, I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and there I really don't do very much of anything, but subsequently to that I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and there I get back into cerebral palsy and I become the chairman of that organization for three years, which takes us now 01:14: to 1967 at which time I go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and the Six Day War.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> before the Six Day War?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">For the last day...the last day. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> were on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and the shoes were where the Arabs ran off and left them running so fast, and it was...it was quite a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">It was a thoroughly, thoroughly...I don't know...I just fell in love with <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , absolutely fell in love with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I met with Motte Gur? __ </span><span class="sentence" id="237">who was the general in charge of the air force at the time...you know Motte? </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I noticed you nodded. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">My wife said to Motte, congratulations on your work for the Six Day War. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And he said to her, we were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for lunch the first day, and, you know, they're, they're not very reluctant to demonstrate their bravado but with it all, then the next year I went back to lecture to parachute troops, and I thought, you know, these guys are going to look up at the <span class="DLF">platform</span> and see this old goat talking to them and they're young and they're full of vim and vigor and they don't...they're not interested in what this guy...unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">They had never jumped in combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">They were jumpers, but they had never been employed as parachute troops, and when I came in telling them stories about our combat jumps and the formation of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">air planes</span> and how we had to do different things, they wasn't...there wasn't anybody in the audience that wasn't electrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Now that's another reason, and the next thing you know I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hetzoa</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="244"><span class="BUILDING">Air Force Base</span> and I meet the commanding officer and I ask him what he needs, and he needs a <span class="INT_SPACE">game room</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">play room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Well, what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and raised the money, and that began it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Then I became very involved in <span class="BUILDING">Bar Ilan University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Actually I became the president of the West Coast Friends of Bar Ilan and the next step in my Israeli occupation was <span class="BUILDING">Sha'arei Tsedek Hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , and there we have the Sedge(??) </span><span class="sentence" id="249">and Henry Plitt Heart Surgery, and the reason for that is that Dr. Matloff (ph) who did heart surgery on me was interested in moving his heart surgeon program to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Prior to his doing that, there was an eighteen month wait between diagnosis and treatment...and and and care in surgery. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Now you have to realize that before they do heart surgery, they do an angiogram. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">There was a three month wait to get an angiogram done, and then after the three month wait, you're on a list. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Hopefully you'll be taken between twelve and eighteen months from then. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">If you're still alive, they'll treat you in eighteen months. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">If you're not, of course, it's academic. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So we wanted to move the same system that they have here at <span class="BUILDING">Cedar Sinai</span> which does a great deal of heart work, over to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and we started it based upon his jumping on my bones, we started a thing called Heart to Heart from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , and today that is functioning at the <span class="BUILDING">Sha'arei Tsedek Hospital</span> , and we're all thrilled with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">QUESTION:  Before we close, I'd like to go back just for a moment to your capture of Streicher and are there any details...between the time you identified who Streicher was and you got him in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> , or even in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> ...did he say anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Did he put up any resistance of any form?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">He didn't put up any resistance, but there 1s a story attached to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">First of all, I was so excited at what I had that I have to tell you, I I didn't follow any rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">His wife gave him a raincoat. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I didn't examine the raincoat. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I didn't know that there was no weapon in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">His wife took his slippers off, which he had been using out on the <span class="DLF">porch</span> , and substituted shoes for them and that's no big deal, but the fact that I let him get that coat and not even feel it to see if there's anything in it was a real blunder, but after I dropped him at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berchtesgarten</span> with the recognition of all the mistakes I'd made because we usually search a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you have taken somebody, from which you have taken somebody, so I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weidring</span> that night and his wife gave me a letter which is here 01:16: in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> ...the original is in the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> ...which indicates that this is the first night they've been separated since their marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">They had been married about forty days. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">She was his nurse I think, and he had left...forgotten to take his glasses with him, and in the letter she enclosed his glasses which she asked me to give to him and she started being extremely tearful, almost to the point of wailing, and I said you just don't understand the American way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">If your husband is the good man that you describe him as being, he'll back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to you, but if he is what we think he is, you'll never see him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">That's all I have to say about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">That's all that happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  Before we close, is there something you'd like to add? </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Is there something you'd like to say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  I think there are two things I would like to say, one of which I may have said earlier but I think it's important to repeat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">One man, one woman, one person can make a big difference in in anything, and the words that are used so frequently in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> today that should be a watch word for all of us, Jew and gentile alike, are the words "Never Again.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  Thank you very much, Mr. Plitt.</span></p>
