<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  In a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoffenheim</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> in the province of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baden</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Supposedly it’s a nice <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Well, it....] returned there recently and I was surprised how charming it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Yes, I must admit, it is very nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Do you have any memories of growing up in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I remember a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I lived there until I was ten or eleven years old so I have a lot of good -- eh -- a lot of memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  Did you have any brothers and sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I have one brother named Menachem. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">He currently lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  And he was the younger brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  He was younger by three years, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  And how about your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Can you tell us something about your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Who they were, what they did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Well, my mother was a typical housewife of its day. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">My father was in business as a butcher. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And they tried to make a living to support us as long as they managed to do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Your father was a butcher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Humfenheim</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Did you live in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> or your own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Well we lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and then as a sort of -- because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was very small there, on the time we were deported there was as few as ten families, my father acted as a cantor. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">When the regular cantor left or died, I’m not sure, we ended up in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was adjoining to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So we lived there until the Kristallnacht when, of course, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was destroyed and we had to move out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We moved in with an uncle who lived in that same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  So you lived in three different <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> in a short period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  Well, as I can remember, it was over a ten -year period.-
QUESTION:  So your father’s <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> , that was separate, away from the <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Yeah, correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  Both of your parents were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Yes, they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Were they Reform, or Conservative, or Orthodox?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Gee, I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But I think it’s a typical German traditional, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Most likely Conservative?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  I don’t believe we ate kosher in the latter years. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">It may well be that in early years we were but I’m really not aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Do you remember what these <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> were like that you lived in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Not in any great detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I -- the only vague memory I have is when I was perhaps three years old, and I believe it was about the time my brother was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I remember very vividly a mouse playing under his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> , that I kept watching.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  A real mouse?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  A real mouse. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And that’s about all I can remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  And he wasn’t your pet mouse?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I don’t know where the mouse came from.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Did you have any pets?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  No, I didn’t, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Hobbies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">By the time I, you know, 1933 was not very far away, I was four years old, and the little kids in the <span class="DLF">street</span> very quickly stopped playing with us and would rather beat us up, so there was very little time for hobbies. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">It was more a question of protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Did any of the kids ever beat you up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, quite frequently and I learned to run as fast as my little legs could carry me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  You mentioned that there were very few Jews in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I imagine half of them were relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I think we, my brother and I, and another girl were the only children that I can remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  And you had at least one uncle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Yes, but he didn’t live in that same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  No?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Did you ever get to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when I was six, which I guess means 1935, and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for about two years, till --- or perhaps it was three, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">No, it was two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Till they prohibited Jewish kids from going to the <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And I was then enrolled in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish operated school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And every morning I had to get up about six and take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> all by myself to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> and in the evening I returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I did this for one or two years, well until the Kristallnacht, and then I think that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">One or two years, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  How was it like going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as one of the few Jewish kids?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  I don’t have very much memory of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , except that there was a lot of persecution. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I was asked to leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> when they talked about Nazi indoctrination, which of course made us little Jewish boys stick out like a sore thumb. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And of course, whenever the kids could catch me they would either push me into the --- some --- the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> that fell up from the <span class="DLF">road</span> , or beat me up otherwise --- anything they could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Recently, I returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">This is an aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> student, who 1s 28 years old wrote a thesis on the life of the Jewish community in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And he found a lot of details about the history of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> and myself and my family, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Things that I didn’t know, I had forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And, in fact, he found my school records. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And I had forgotten all my grades, but I can tell you they were terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  You were a terrible student?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Well, it’s not surprising.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Or, how did the teachers treat you? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">That was my next question, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  How what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  How did the teachers treat you? </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Sometimes people had terrible grades but they were good students.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Well, I really don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I think all the teachers were Nazis, ultimately. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Otherwise I don’t think they could teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And I think as long as he had to put up with me he did, and when I was prohibited from attending, I guess --- I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But I was surprised to find my grades after about 50 years, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Wasn’t particularly paramount on my mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Even then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  I have the piece of paper, if you want to look at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  That piece, his thesis, oh, the book, the research. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">That would be interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  It’s quite amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">It’s quite an experience to meet these Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">In fact, it’s something I’d like to talk to you about later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  The rest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , were they, uh, was it more of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Protestant town</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Catholic town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  I don’t know what the percentages was, but I have the impression it was maybe 80/20 Protestant, but I can’t tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">There was one <span class="BUILDING">church</span> each, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  Did you have any, I hesitate to say friends, but any non-Jewish acquaintances?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I don’t remember really playing with any particular kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">When you ask that question, the image comes to mind of the first funeral I went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">One of the non-Jewish kids died of something and the whole class, I was still in the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , went to the funeral. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">The first time I’ve ever been in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And I vividly remember the open <span class="DLF">grave</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span> in it and every kid was supposed to go by and drop a flower on top of this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And I was so scared, I just couldn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">That’s all I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Now whether this kid was a particular friend of mine, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I don’t have any vivid memory of ever really playing, or really having a good time to tell you the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I, or perhaps I and my brother, but my brother was so much younger, were always too busy fleeing from being attacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I remember the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were full of pretty large rocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">These were not paved <span class="DLF">roads</span> , they were <span class="DLF">dirt roads</span> with rock over them. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And I always had bloody knees because I always kept stumbling and falling as the kids would pursue me or they would throw rocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They were very handy little missiles, you know, pick them off the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and start throwing. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So my memories were not particularly happy ones in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  These were kids that were roughly your age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Yeah, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  You didn’t have teenagers for example going after you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  No, they didn’t bother with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Not that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I think that some of the older people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in the time of higher excitement, particularly after, maybe Hitler made a speech, and we would venture out in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , in those days they still had horses and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I remember vividly one particular man who lived close by coming down that <span class="DLF">street</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and taking his, what do you call this thing that you hit horses with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  The whip.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Take the whip and try to catch me walking in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">You know, with the whip.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  Crack the whip.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Cracking ---
QUESTION:  Cracking the whip in your direction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  No, not in my direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">He hit me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  He got you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But I think in general that, kind of, was the exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  It must have been lonely not having many kids your age that you could play with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  I guess so. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I really don’t have any strong memories of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  How were you informed that you could no longer go to this <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I think just that one day, I think, my parents told me I was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> to continue <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And they would buy me a ticket, a monthly commuter ticket, just like the Long Island Railroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And every morning, I would end up on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with a school bag on my back and a big thermos bottle in the school bag with the books, that was my lunch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Did you know any Nazis?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Well I think the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was full of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And based on what this fellow wrote in his thesis, more recently, apparently, he tried to interview some of them even as late as last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They threatened him with mayhem if he kept up the research.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  There are Nazis still in hold?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  Of course we observed many of the, we saw many of the Nazi festivals, and so on, going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But, you know, the Nazis were, as usual, disciplined, and they would only take over the action when it was sanctioned like, Kristallnacht, and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Otherwise, because, presumably, my father --- not presumably, but my father was a soldier in World War I. He had somewhat higher stature, if you like, in hierarchy of how they were treating the Jews and some others. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Of course in the final analysis it didn’t do him any good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  And your father was in the German army in World War I?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Yeah, he was in the German army for four years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  A decorated veteran?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  Yeah, he had a cross of this, a cross of that, which I remember he dramatically threw at the Gestapo agent when they eventually deported us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  In 1940”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  In 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  “This may come as a surprise to you but you were a privileged child because your father was a war veteran ---
ANSWER:  Is that really ---?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  -- Apparently you were able to go to <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> longer than the other kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  Was that so? </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">A little distinction. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Yeah, they did make a little distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  Yes, two or three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  Yes and I remember when the --- after the Kristallnacht, he was arrested and he was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> like most of the males, if not all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">He was privileged. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">He was let out four weeks afterwards and some other people had to wait a little bit longer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  So he was able to return <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after this first trip?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  Yeah, well I think most of them returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  Yeah, what was his crime?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  His crime? </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I guess being a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">QUESTION:  Being a Jew, that was it, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  He hadn’t done a thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">ANSWER:  Well all the males were arrested, after the Kristallnacht so the reason, I don’t know what they are, logical, or if they needed any.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  You remember Kristallnacht fairly well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  Yeah, but before we talk about it, I’d like to tell you one incident which was --- and I don’t remember what year it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We lived in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Humfenheim</span> , essentially an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">agricultural town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">In those days some farmers still lived upstairs and the cows lived downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I mean that’s how close they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">regional town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sinsheim</span> is about four kilometers from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And for some reason or another, my brother and I were walking to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sinsheim</span> I don’t remember why, and one of the pleasures along that <span class="DLF">road</span> was that the <span class="DLF">road</span> was lined on both sides with apple <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">It must have been the time when the apples were just about ripened, but they weren’t ripe yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And to this day I love green apples. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We ate a lot of green apples as we walked along that <span class="DLF">national road</span> , a two-lane road. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And we’d take a bite out of the apple and we would throw the rest of the apple at whatever <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was speeding by. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We would miss most of them but this particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , we hit right smack on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and the whole apple splattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> came to a grinding halt, backed up, and it turns out that the apple had hit the SS sign of this particular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> which was on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And the SS guy comes out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . “</span><span class="sentence" id="215">Who threw the apple?’ </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And we both denied it, and of course he knew we were lying. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">He took our name and didn’t say anything more. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">That night we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and our father says, “I had a call... I was visited by the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">What did you guys do? </span><span class="sentence" id="220">You were throwing apples.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="221">We weren’t throwing apples.” </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And he hit us across the face, I can still...
QUESTION:  You lied to your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">ANSWER:  I lied to my father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  He believed the SS over you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">ANSWER:  Well, I was so scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I remember that very vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So when you say did I encounter any Nazis, well that was a very close encounter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  That’s a very close encounter. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">SS.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="239">QUESTION:  Do you recall how his business fared after the Nazis came to power?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  No, I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I think it probably followed the typical German history of this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">These <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were surprisingly proactive. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And based on what this fellow, recently has told me, it’s still true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  In general, the Nazis were much more popular and stronger in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  Even though there weren’t very many Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  No, but at least you knew who they were, and of course... An interesting incident that this guy told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">There’s a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> there in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , today, and would you believe that every Friday they bake and sell challah? </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And he told me that they do this because I guess the Christian population loved the challah, even though it was Jewish bread, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And today, they have forgotten what the history, he told me, they forgotten the history of why is this bread baked the way it Is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">QUESTION:  And when. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And when.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">This generation at least, has forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">It is amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  And yet they do it on Friday.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yeah, for the weekend, in other words. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">That’s amazing I thought... here is archeology in action while I’m still alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  Do any other incidents leap to your mind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  From that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  Well, one memory 1s the...all of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> had <span class="DLF">communal gardens</span> ... and if you didn’t, most people didn’t have a lot of <span class="REGION">land</span> on their own, they lived in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , you could get a little plot from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> raise your own vegetables and of course, you take that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And I remember my mother working in this <span class="DLF">communal garden</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And we, as kids, would go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">local river</span> which flows right by, which when I look at it now is about three feet wide, at that time it looked terrifying, and take water out and put it in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I’m still afraid of water because we used to swim in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , or try to, and the other kids would like to drown us. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And I’m still terrified of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">In fact, I’m a very poor swimmer, I think as a result of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  You live on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Long Island</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="276">A? </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Incidents, and Iam a sailor too. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I...One winter, we, I had some sort like a snow- suit on, very warmly dressed, it was very cold there. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cooking stove</span> which was fired, I think, by coal or wood, probably coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And a big pot of soup was bubbling away. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Someone accidently turned that soup over and it landed on my leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I got a tremendous burn over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">This was the time when Jews couldn’t receive medical attention from non-Jewish doctors and there was no Jewish doctor in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And I almost died because they... Eventually the doctor that delivered me in 1929 who came from another little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sisnheim</span> I was talking about, snuck into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at night and provided some limited amount of medical attention.. I remember that particular incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Of course I’m carrying that scar around
QUESTION:  Was he a Jewish doctor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  No, he was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">He was a Christian doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I don’t remember his name but he was a nice guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I remember a time, you probably know the year, when they insisted that all of the Jewish boys and girls get a Jewish identity card. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">When is that ’38?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  "38.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  °38. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Again we had to go to this (unintelligible ) <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and get the card, get the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">In fact I have the picture here in my file, and from then on I had a middle name called <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  And if you has a sister?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  Do you remember your parents talking about politics or talking about the Nazis in the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  I don’t have any real recollection. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">They must have been so preoccupied and so overwhelmed with the day-to-day problems of making a living and making ends meet that if they did talk about it maybe they talked about it when I wasn’t present but I really don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  Do you remember whether your mother was allowed to tend her <span class="DLF">garden</span> until the deportation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  I don’t remember how far that went, or how long this lasted. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I have no idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION:  And Kristallnacht you remember?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  Can you describe what you saw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  Yeah, what I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that morning, and went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">This didn’t happen in the night of the 9th to 10th in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">QUESTION:  They were behind a day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  Yeah, I guess they didn’t get the message or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Even though, you know, this was a particular (unintelligible) what was his name? </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Wagner, I think, who apparently was more rabid than most. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And apparently he was a major factor behind this. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And the first thing I knew 1s when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> and got to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they told a lot of kids to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because something was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Or maybe they told us what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I don’t remember the specific event. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION:  This was at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">The <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and caught the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> I possibly could. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">This was not exactly on the half-hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And as I was walking out from the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and looking up the so called main <span class="DLF">street</span> , right by the little <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> I suddenly saw my parents pushing a very large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pushcart</span> with whatever, in retrospect, they could save from this <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was right adjoining the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> I was telling you about. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And pushing it, you know, to my uncle’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they had made room for us to live with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">They did not, as I remember, they didn’t burn that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="329">They literally took axes and hammers and kind of destroyed it bit by bit without setting it on fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">When I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> about a year and a half ago, for the second time, the local minister walked me around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">This is a whole separate subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And he took me to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was, which I had a little trouble remembering and, well, there it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">They had managed to put a little plaque up which said “former <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ”. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">They had, of course appropriated eventually the real estate, and a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> had been built on that lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So there’s no evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">That’s really all I remember except my father being arrested, sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and came back, I believe about four weeks later. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">It was snowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">This was November so this would make sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">December, January or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">He was limping very badly, had a red bandage, a red kerchief-like tied around foot, you know, ambling into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I remember that particular scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">That’s about all I can remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  Kristallnacht, you never returned to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Your parents had basically left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">It was all destroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  The <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was gutted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  Yeah, all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was destroyed and whatever belongings we might have had were destroyed except what they could manage to get on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pushcart</span> was there at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  Yeah, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  And your younger brother was with your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  I believe so, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">He was too young to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything else on that day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  Not really, not really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  Just walking into your uncle’s <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="357">wasn’t there either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">ANSWER:  Well, no, he was also at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , so here you had all the women and children living in this one <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">That’s the place where I got burned so it must have been °38, ’39 it must have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything your father said when he came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER:  I really don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I think it was ... I think I remember tears but I don’t remember words.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  How was life the next few years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  It’s a blank. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I don’t remember what life was like the nest two years, except that my father’s brother, with his wife and daughter, the (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="367">that was mentioned earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">South Birken</span> which is more or less on the <span class="DLF">border</span> with <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I guess they were forced to evacuate because Jews couldn’t live too close to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , I suppose, and they also moved in with us, with that uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So now a family of two suddenly became five and now suddenly became eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And of course, the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> got a little tight with eight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">QUESTION:  Were these uncles all brothers of your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">The uncle we moved in with was the uncle of my father, not my uncle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">It was your father’s uncle?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  Not really except that you know that the war was so favorable to the Germans so quickly they were all elated and I think the happier they were the more anti-Jewish they became. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I mean it just were a way of beating up on somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I remember vividly, I must have gone to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> , and they had a big exhibition under a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> in the middle of the town square of some of the war booty that they had captured in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I think it was French equipment, maybe also British equipment from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dunkirk</span> .. And of course, theoretically, only Germans were allowed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">At that time we couldn’t go to the movie... I’ve never seen a movie in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , no we couldn’t go to the movies...

<p><span class="sentence" id="416">ANSWER:  Well, as I can remember it, the police came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and they told us we had two hours to pack some minimum amount they allowed us to carry, I forgot how many kilograms it may have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">One of them stayed with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">QUESTION:  One of the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  One of the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  Police or storm troopers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I thought he had a black uniform on but I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I know he had a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Guns were still somewhat unique. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And he kind of rested his hand on the gun, I think it was just a way of kind of resting his hand, I don’t think he meant anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And frankly, I don’t know what the reaction of my parents was. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Except that there was a lot of scurrying around and grabbing suitcases and so on and so forth and stuffing in rather irrelevant things I’m sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">In fact, I know it was irrelevant because later on I found some of those things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  Did you help pack?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  Did you help pack?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  I don’t think so, no, I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And that’s one incident I remember when my father had some words with the policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">He might have known him. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I don’t know whether he was a local guy or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And, kind of threw him or handed him his Iron Cross from World War I. The next thing I remember is we walked through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , I believe, down to <span class="BUILDING">City Hall</span> , where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , some sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> or perhaps <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was waiting and they put us all in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , with whatever bags we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">The local Germans were, of course, were looking around their curtains, of course, and their <span class="DLF">doorways</span> and what not. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I don’t remember anybody saying anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And they trucked us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">To the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Where we boarded a waiting <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">This was not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car train</span> , this was a passenger coacher, and there we sat, probably waiting for a number of other people coming in, and eventually the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> started to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I remember an incident where the accompanying Germans, I presumed they were Gestapo but I really don’t know, asked for all valuables. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And I presume, as good Germans, we probably handed them over, I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">That’s about all I can remember from the trip except eventually we stopped at the <span class="DLF">German border</span> , and I’m almost 100% sure it stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mullhurst</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mullhurst</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Did it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah because I remember, I think I saw that name on the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And it stopped and went and it took a rather long time and eventually it ended up in some <span class="DLF">siding</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">We had no idea where we were because nobody told us where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And they took us off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and ’'m quite sure it was raining and we ended up on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dump trucks</span> , I know these were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dump trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">There was a lot of mud, and they trucked us, I guess, from (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="454"><span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="455">into what turned out to be Gurst (?). </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I had no idea where they were taking us. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I mean I had no idea what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">We just...it’s almost like being asleep walk at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I don’t know what the adults were thinking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  Even though you were going to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  Before you...
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I had no idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">QUESTION:  Nobody...
ANSWER:  I had no idea and I’m not sure they told this to anybody till eventually they ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and of course they probably could see and read the signs at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We knew nothing about this Madagascar business and so on that eventually developed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  You all sat together on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  Family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">QUESTION:  Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">QUESTION:  As far as you could tell of the Jews, all of Jews that you knew from your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> were on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  Well, I presume so. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I knew all the Jews were deported at the same time...
QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  ...and I presume we were more or less in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I imagine they loaded those as people came along, I really don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  What did you take? </span><span class="sentence" id="479">What did your parents take?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">But, I know that after my parents were re-deported from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurst</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> eventually, my mother left behind one of those suitcases which somehow reached me where I was and it had a lot of bed linen in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">But bed- linens. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">At long last.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">QUESTION:  How were you treated at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurst</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">ANSWER:  Well as you know <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurst</span> was divided and men and women were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Both of us ended with the mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">We were in (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="491">if I remember right. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">You know being curious boys, this was all new. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">There was naturally a <span class="DLF">fence</span> around it. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">There were <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , completely bare. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I don’t believe we had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I don’t remember that when we moved in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And all the people were just kind of laying like stacked wood, one next to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I saw my first death there one morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Someone who was laying near me, perhaps not next to me, passed away during the night and my mother rushed me out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , as quickly as she could. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">This was October/November, and as you know was rather miserable weather. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Very muddy, very rainy, rather cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I don’t remember the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> being heated, but they might have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">It was a rather, you know, difficult situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">The <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> were communal and <span class="INT_SPACE">washing area</span> was communal where everyone washed in a long <span class="DLF">trough</span> with, I believe it was a pipe that had a bunch of holes punched in it and someone turned the faucet on and the water came out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">QUESTION:  Cold water only?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I believe so, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I don’t believe there were showers. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I can’t remember any showers. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">But then as a boy I wasn’t too anxious to shower anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I remember the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">They were surprisingly mechanical. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">You climbed up a bunch of <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and there was a <span class="DLF">platform</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And they had the fifty gallon barrels under the big <span class="DLF">hole</span> and you did your thing and then it plopped into the barrel. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And the...the small narrow range railroad, <span class="DLF">railway</span> , <span class="DLF">rail line</span> , circled the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they would move these barrels on top of some sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">flatbed car</span> like affair, and they would push it to wherever they would dump it. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">That’s how they moved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I don’t remember why I would know that detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">As kids, we would... the camp of course was not guarded by Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">This was <span class="REGION">Vichy France</span> , guarded by French soldiers who were relatively loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I don’t know how, but, we as kids, managed to crawl under the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and go to visit our father in the separate part of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">My father lucked out because he was a butcher, they thought he would make a cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And he ended up working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And he would sneak us an extra piece of bread or whatever he could lay his hands on. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I have some vague memory of going... Some of the older boys would sneak into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">local town</span> , which was about...
QUESTION:  So you could get out of the <span class="DLF">outer fence</span> too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And I remember buying some pate, in a tin can. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I don’t know where we got the money, and going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I remember one guard, oh yeah ... we had a very good looking redhead in this <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and...
QUESTION:  That’s right, you were in the women’s ...
ANSWER:  Yeah, I instantly fell in love with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I don’t know how old she was, she must have eighteen, twenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">With long reddish hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">P’ve had a red hair fetish ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And, I remember watching her making love with that French soldier, that French guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">She wore a cross and obviously she was half, so-called, half Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  She never reciprocated interest in you, though?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I was too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I saw my father’s? </span><span class="sentence" id="538">brother there a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">I saw the other uncle, my mother’s brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I don’t remember seeing my grandmother, who died there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">QUESTION:  You didn’t attend her funeral?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">ANSWER:  But she died after I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">The mud is the most memorable thing I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">It’s an incredible mark, it’s very deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">We, somehow, we, many of us ended up with galoshes, which is, you know, sort of a rubber shoe. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">If you stepped in that mud and then tried to pull it out, the suction of that mud was such that you could lose your shoe. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And I remember many older people, falling in that mud and having a hell of a time getting back out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And if you went to help them, they would pull you in the mud. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And so for many months (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="550">struggled with that mud. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I don’t know why that sticks in my head, but it seems to have been a major problem...
QUESTION:  That seems to be a major memory of all the people who were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurst</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">ANSWER:  I remember getting some terribly strong vaccinations and believe it or not I have a certificate from (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="553">signed by the doctor at (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="554">against typhoid, diphtheria, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Apparently these things developed in those great environments very quickly and they inoculated, I guess, all the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And I presume many of the deaths which occurred there, probably occurred due to some of these epidemics that developed that you might know more about us than I do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="558">QUESTION:  When you weren’t eating pate, what were you eating in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , what did they feed you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  The standard fare seemed to be just some sort of a soup with some vegetables floating in it, that’s all I can remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">QUESTION:  Not especially tasty?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="561">ANSWER:  Not particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">The French eat a lot of beets, at least we ended up with a lot of beets, and (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="563">we called them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  How about quantity?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  Oh I think we were always hungry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  You were always hungry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I don’t remember any particular packages coming in from the Salvation Army or the Red Cross and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I know these people in later years, I found out they were quite active, but I wasn’t particularly aware of that activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">It doesn’t mean that it didn’t exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">As I said we managed to get some extra pieces of bread from my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">He would hold it at the end of a long fork against this open fire where they had these big, tremendous, fifty- gallon drums bubbling away with the coup of the day and he would toast it. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And they had these, maybe five gallon drums of fat standing there, and he would spread that on the toasted bread and that would taste like <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">QUESTION:  Not a <span class="INT_SPACE">kosher kitchen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  No, I don’t think there was any attempt at that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="576">QUESTION:  Was there any cooking outside of this <span class="INT_SPACE">central kitchen</span> where your father worked?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">ANSWER:  Not that ’'m aware of, not that I’m aware of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  Now, earlier, you mentioned that you saw your teacher from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">QUESTION:  Was there any attempt to resume schooling, have classes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">ANSWER:  I don’t believe so, not while I was there, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I have no recollection of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">QUESTION:  Now the time you were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">What did you do during the day when you weren’t sneaking out under the <span class="DLF">fence</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">ANSWER:  I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I don’t know how we spent the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">QUESTION:  Not much to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  I guess, you know, kids at that age, as long as they are in reasonably good health, I guess we ran around, we probably became very rowdy and non-controllable, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I really don’t know what we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">QUESTION:  I’m sure you tried to stay warm, this was winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">You had gotten there just in the nick of time as far as winter is concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  I imagine I blocked out quite a bit of these negative part, I only seem to remember the better parts, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">QUESTION:  Did anyone have any idea what was to become of you? </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Where you would go or how long you would stay or why you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I don’t what the adults knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I had no idea what they talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I don’t know if they, men and women, ever got together even for talking purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">All I know 1s that one day my mother and father both said that they had volunteered us to be taken out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> by some organization and I don’t remember my reaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I don’t know whether I was delighted or reluctant. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">But we found ourselves, I guess, again on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with forty-seven some other children, fifty children were taken out and we eventually ended up in a <span class="BUILDING">French orphanage</span> , near that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  Do you remember when this was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">This was in 1941, February °41.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">QUESTION:  February °41.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">ANSWER:  So I was in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> about three to four months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">QUESTION:  You were taken to an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> nearby?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">ANSWER:  Yes, so my brother and I, with the other kids, were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and it turned out later on that a branch of the American Quakers, the American Friends Service Committee, acting through the Swedish chapter, had made arrangements with the French government to take these fifty children out. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">The French in World War 1, you know, had lost many men, so there were millions, I guess literally millions, of <span class="BUILDING">households</span> without males. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So they built a whole number of <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> ... (side one of tape ended, pick up with side two)
QUESTION:  We were talking about the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> ...
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And this was now roughly twenty years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">The orphans of course had grown up, the <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> were relatively empty and, I guess, somebody was smart enough to realize that here was a possible <span class="NPIP">place</span> where, at least you could put some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">As I understand it, the Quakers committed themselves to feed the whole <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> if they took these fifty Jewish children ... So we ended up in this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> in a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aspet</span> , A-S-P-E-T, in the Haute Garron (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="614">department. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Near...
QUESTION:  Towards the Atlantic?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">This was right at the foot of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pyrenees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">It was not too far from (?). </span><span class="sentence" id="619">It was near a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Grodance</span> (???).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">QUESTION:  But it’s toward the <span class="REGION">western part</span> , that would be rather than towards the Mediterranean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">ANSWER:  I guess so. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">But it is quite close by. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">We ended up in this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I believe it was a two or three story affair, there was a sort of a classical institutional looking affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">These German kids, of course now we were Germans, we weren’t Jewish, in this French institution. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">The French had just lost the war so they didn’t have a lot of love for the Germans, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So we were the (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="628">no matter how you looked at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">The director of the camp was an interesting man ...
QUESTION:  The director of the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  Of the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , and he had some women who helped him. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">They organized us like little soldiers and that’s how ... there were roughly half and half boys and half girls in this little group of Jewish children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  Kept separate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  We were kept separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">As I remember we did not go to <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span> , <span class="BUILDING">French schools</span> rather.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">QUESTION:  The nationality of the director ...
ANSWER:  He was French.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">QUESTION:  He was French.</span></p>

ANSWER:  The Quakers just came and went. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I mean they came perhaps once every few months and see how we were doing and then left. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I guess they provided food in part for the whole <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="641">There were of course other French children there. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">It was a fairly self-contained community relatively speaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">They had their own <span class="DLF">fields</span> where they raised vegetables. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I remember they had a man on the horse who did the plowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">They had an <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And I guess they tried to bring us up as sort of little bit like French kids would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">They walked us around the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> somewhat on a <span class="REGION">military side</span> , but I guess that’s the only way you could control fifty kids.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="658">ANSWER:  I think we did some chores and at sometime they brought in a Jewish couple who lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and I think he would come in and give us some modicum of instruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I doubt it was particularly effective but they made an attempt when he was till busy hiding of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">This was <span class="REGION">Vichy France</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">The only memories I have is this farmer who took care of the <span class="DLF">fields</span> where they grew the vegetables, one day they decided, somebody decided, they were going to kill the cows so they could feed the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And it’s an indescribable scene on how this cow was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I don’t know if you want to hear about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">For the hell of it I'll tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">There was a manhole cover right in front of the so-called <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span> , or the Refectoire, as the French called it, and they tied the cow down on this <span class="DLF">manhole</span> which was of course steel and relatively heavy, by the horns, so the cow was now sort of ...

QUESTION:  And meat was a luxury.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  Oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Well that was rare. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Every afternoon it seemed like they would insist we would walk in fairly ordered fashion through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and through the surrounding <span class="REGION">countryside</span> , which in retrospect was quite beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And they would teach us French songs and we would march to these songs and that’s how we got our fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I remember when we first got there, I guess we had a lot of lice and all the boys got their hair cut down to the scalp, including myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I have a pict..they took a set of I.D. pictures of every kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I still have one of them from that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">There was a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> wetting, I remember and I think I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And they shamed us ...
QUESTION:  Unintentional.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">ANSWER:  Oh yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Well I think all of the kids were obviously disturbed. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And that went on a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I remember, I don’t know why, I remember the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> , the typical French, just a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the ground, with an appliance over the <span class="DLF">hole</span> and you put your feet on either <span class="NPIP">side</span> and you crouch down and do your thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Paper was very rare and many of boys would wipe their behind by just cleaning their finger on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And one of the jobs that we had was to clean the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Well we tried to instill in the kids to stop doing that but one kid would continue to do it and we couldn’t find out who it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">So we decided to stake out the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> had fairly high <span class="DLF">walls</span> but they were open on top and on the bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">So we put two kids on top of the <span class="DLF">wall</span> watching, and this one kid would come into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and he did his thing and wipe his finger on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and of course we beat the hell out of him.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Yeah, a couple of months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">ANSWER:  And I guess at that time they passed some sort of law that Jews couldn’t live within 20 miles of the <span class="DLF">Spanish border</span> or something like that, and we were closer than that to the <span class="DLF">Spanish border</span> and some magic hand, I don’t know who, the Quaker, the Ouzay (?), </span><span class="sentence" id="760">or whatever it was, took us out of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and sent up temporarily to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toulouse</span> , where we were in some sort of a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And within a month or two I ended up in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montsac</span> (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="762">which is in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="763">department. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And there was a <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> there which was run by a Jewish organization.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="776">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">No, but you didn’t know that he had made it to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  I don’t know whether I knew that or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">I went to see him after the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> so somehow I knew or found out where he was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">QUESTION:  So the group of 48 transferred out of the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> ...

<p><span class="sentence" id="795">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Boys and girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">It was strictly co-ed. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">The girls were on one <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , the boys on the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And we were getting through the puberty stage and in fact there were some that were eighteen, perhaps twenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And you know, any number of girls got pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">It was not unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">But it was fairly, you know, it was a decent life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="803">QUESTION:  Were here boys and girls from other parts of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="804">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">They were French Jews and there were people from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="806">These were families that might have moved to ... children who ended up from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> before the war, didn’t have, necessarily French passports, you know, so all kinds of mixture. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">There were not that many German Jewish children there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="812">ANSWER:  Well, yes, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I’m sure with a very heavy accent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">QUESTION:  And ironically all of this was under direct German occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">By that time it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">This <span class="BUILDING">home</span> started before the occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="868">QUESTION:  Jews, Jewish refugees or rescuers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">ANSWER:  I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I guess there was more concerned for fellows who were eighteen, twenty, twenty-five years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I was still fourteen, fifteen at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">On the assumption you could hide your identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">You know, if you didn’t register for labor in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and so on you were subject to arrest even if you were French. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Well that’s how we somehow got through the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">We somehow heard about D-Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And eventually we all ended up back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montsac</span> in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="877">The <span class="BUILDING">home</span> now took over a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , a relatively new <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that the Vichy government had built for physical education because they were going to develop their own master race. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">So we ended up in this rather posh <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which today, incidentally is a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> which I slept in when I was back there in 1972. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">It was a time-warp experience of it’s own. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And

<p><span class="sentence" id="886">QUESTION:  Did you ever see combat troops, either German or American?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">ANSWER:  The only real memory I have is seeing a big <span class="DLF">pipeline</span> with a lot of gasoline leaking out of it and I’ve never seen red gasoline before, it was all red, on some of the major <span class="DLF">roads</span> we were hiking on. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I think, of course, that happened while we were in the boy-scout camp since they landed in June. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">This all happened during the summer so I presume we were not in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">QUESTION:  The landing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> was in June. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">The landing in the <span class="REGION">Mediterranean</span> was in August. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">You were kind of in the middle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="893">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">So I’m sure I saw the <span class="DLF">pipeline</span> that came out from probably <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> or (?). </span><span class="sentence" id="895">There wasn’t any significant fighting as I remember it in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="896">I think most of the fighting was up north of course and it didn’t take too long for the Germans to all hustle themselves north and east trying to...
QUESTION:  Avoid the trap...
ANSWER:  ...to defend the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> part of the invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">But I don’t think there was any fighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="898">QUESTION:  In your <span class="REGION">area</span> they were in risk, they were in danger of being cut off from the Mediterranean operation up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhone valley</span> linking up with the operation north which would have cut off all the forces to the southwest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="899">ANSWER:  I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">So what we saw more of was the (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="902">taking revenge on the local French, particularly, I remember rather vividly the women who had so-called fraternized with the French, getting their hair shorn, that was more prominent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">QUESTION:  Those were the quite fortunate ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">ANSWER:  So we ended back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montsac</span> and tried to return to normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started again etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Somehow I believe this was a Quaker (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="908">somehow got in touch with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">They wanted to know if I knew anyone in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and whether I wanted to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">So I said, “Well, yes I remember my parents telling me about an uncle in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="911">In retrospect, it wasn’t an uncle, it was a second cousin of my grandmother’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">It was a man who had come over in something like 1908. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">In fact, he was a brother of the man we moved in with after Kristallnacht. (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="914">and they placed an ad in the paper, in the <span class="REGION">New York area</span> , and he had over his many years, sponsored maybe something like 20 or 30 couples to come here (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And he told me in retrospect he got a lot of calls.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="916">QUESTION:  So you didn’t have to be a cousin, or...
ANSWER:  On this ad. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Well, at this time they were curious on who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">None of his families. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And he asked me whether I come over. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I remember receiving a very large package with, I believe a salami that looked like it was three feet long but maybe it was only one foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And I remember standing at the <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> , in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which I shared with a number of other boys, and slicing salami for two or three hours because everybody’s coming by getting a piece of salami. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">After about a year, well, in fact it was December ’46, I eventually came over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="924">QUESTION:  To the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="925">ANSWER:  And I came over early, believe it or not, because I was not on a Jewish quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">I was now on a German quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And the German quota was undersubscribed because during the war, obviously did not come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="928">QUESTION:  It was unused?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">ANSWER:  Yeah, and since I had so called ... in the eyes of the Americans I was a German, so I could get in under the German quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Irony, isn’t it. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">So I ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I came over on the Normandy (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Q @)
ANSWER:  No, I stayed here five years and I had a dying to go to <span class="REGION">California</span> and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I ended up in <span class="REGION">California</span> for 15-16 years and came back here in 1970. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And here we are in 1992.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="943">QUESTION:  You were never tempted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="945">QUESTION:  Were your parents especially happy with (?). </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Did they ever talk about or think about leaving there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">ANSWER:  Yes, they wanted to come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And as a matter of fact they had a quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">Believe it or not I remember the number. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">Not exactly, but 1t was something like 16,000 something, and they were waiting for an affidavit from this same uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And perhaps had the affidavit, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">But obviously you couldn’t go until your number was up.</span></p>
