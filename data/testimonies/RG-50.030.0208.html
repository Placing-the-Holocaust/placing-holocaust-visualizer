<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Start by telling us your name, please.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name ts Fred Schwartz.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Where were you born and when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in November 30th...October...I'm sorry...October 30th, 1928, in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Hungary</span> by the name Kotaj.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Can you talk a little bit about your childhood, what it was like growing as a Jewish child at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Well, it wasn't easy in general speaking because wherever you go you got hurt verbally, physically, just because you are born Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And sometimes I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> crying; and my father should rest in peace, he was just like a helpless father. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It hurt him. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">But he says, " __?"-- "</span><span class="sentence" id="9">What can I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I can't go to the authorities because we are Jews, and we have to suffer." </span><span class="sentence" id="11">It's no use to go to authorities to complain that this boy, this and this boy hit me, or this boy cursed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">It was of no use. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So we just had to go alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And there was no other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  What...what was your family life like? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">What were your parents like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Hard working people, and they tried their best for us, like sending us to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and providing us with the best like a Jewish parents, but they also had their difficulties on account, because...because they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And specially after 1940 when all the Jews between 18 and 60 had to report to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> and I...and my brother and I, the middle one, we had to take over my father's duty which was to deliver...uh...seltzer to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and two, three <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> around us, surroundings...more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And we had to do as I was at that time 13 years old and I had to do my father's work because we still had to live on to survive, and my father was away in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So we had to do work which was not for a 13 year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Definitely! </span><span class="sentence" id="22">In the winter time which in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> is very tough winter, the snow comes down in November and it goes away in March. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And we had to deliver the soda...seltzer with the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And sometimes, lot of times, the seltzer bottles busted from the...it was frozen, but...so I had to go down from the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> , step down...had to run, otherwise I would be frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So it was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Very hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Before 1940...uh...when events were taking place all over Europe that were so terrible, in your small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> what did you and your family know about these things and how did they affect you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  The outside world did not affect us too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">All we did is we heard things, but it was...what we heard, it was like unbelievable because nobody could imagine it's true, but we heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And naturally...naturally, the Hungarian newspaper didn't write about it, but we heard as...specially it was very hard because by the time it came down to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> like us from the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , you know, it's...uh...but people were talking, talking, but nobody had proof until a few hundred Polish Jews run away from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , first to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and from there to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> because they figured the Germans not going to come into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And they told us stories which was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">They just said they just take people near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and they shoot them in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , just like that, and they're killing...taking ...taking fathers and they just killing and killing and killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">But who wanted to believe such things...that could happen in a civilized world? </span><span class="sentence" id="34">But then we had firsthand information that it is true, because they took away one family from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> consisted of 35 Jewish family...families. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And from that 35 family, one was a family who came about 20, 25 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">That means...uh...25 years ago, that was in 1915, 1920, that from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And they were considered as Polish citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And they were taken away, the whole family, in '40. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And we didn't know nothing about where they were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We knew a year later. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">One person from the family somehow escaped, and he made it back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">That time the man was...I don't know exactly, but in the 30s. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And then what he told us what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">But still we...uh...we're helpless. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">What can we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We couldn't run away, and we had to take what he said for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">But (ph) we said this could never happen in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ; because the Hungarian Jews...most of them...were assimilated, and they didn't consider themselves as Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">They considered themselves real Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So why should we worry? </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Polish Jews, and Austrian Jews and this and that--there're all kind of...but could never happen by us, that's why and all...we didn't want to believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And that went...went on for 4 years from 1940 'til March 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We heard people said this, that, but we don't...did not believe what's going on until the Germans came into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And that was March 17...March 19, I think when the Hungarian...the Germans came into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  And then can you describe the changes that occurred as soon as the Germans did come in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">First of all, we...well it took them a week or two to get organized cause they came...they worked on how to organize the Hungarian Jews to do what they did to the rest of the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So it took about 2 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">First they gave an order that every Jew had to wear a yellow... yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And then a week later, which happened to be Passover...happened to be Passover holiday... You know, in our small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ...1n Europe, people didn't read no newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Well, the intelligent people did, but most of them didn't know how to read newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So there were ...if there were some news, any news, a guy used to go around and poke...you know what I mean, so when...when all the people come around, let's say in radius of a tenth of a mile or a twentieth of a mile and when everybody got together, then he told the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">The news was that no Jew is allowed to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Anybody gonna caught be killed right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So that went on for another 2 weeks, and then came the deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">How the deportation was? </span><span class="sentence" id="67">First, what they did is they got together all the Jews in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ...in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , because every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">From there, they got horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> and they took us to the next big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyiregyhaza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">It's called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyiregyhaza</span> , where also they took us to the big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And we were there during the night and like in every big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , they made one area of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where most of the Jews lived because usually in Europe in big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> there are special <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish quarters</span> you know where the Jew concentrated, you know, so that's...and they put in a couple of families in each <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish apartments</span> , and we stayed there for 2 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And then they took us to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> , but no more <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">No more horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">That was only from the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">From...from the big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , they took us to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and they took us <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> , big <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> , you know where they used to dry the tobacco and all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And that's where we stayed another 2, 3 weeks before the deportation started. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Well..uh...we walked back from the...from the <span class="DLF">farm</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nyiregyhaza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> ...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ... mean the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ..I don't know how many...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> were waiting for us...naturally, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagons</span> , not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> where people ride, and they put us in as many people as they could put in. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And they close the <span class="DLF">door</span> from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">There was only a small <span class="DLF">window</span> with <span class="DLF">iron gates</span> just to get a little air. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">For sanitation purpose there was only a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Man, woman, together! </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And that lasted 3 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I'm never gonna forget there is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> by the name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassa</span> .’ </span><span class="sentence" id="84">It's called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">K-A-S-S-A. But in Hungarian it's pronounced <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And we stayed there, because that was not far from the border of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And my mother should rest in peace, through that <span class="DLF">window</span> ...she got up so she can reach the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And she saw people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> --naturally, Gentiles--and she begged for a little water. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And they were laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I'm never gonna forget that moment in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">When my mother asked for a little water, and they would...instead of saying yes or no, they were just laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">On the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , I think that was special ' Hungarian name for the Czech city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ko8ice</span> (known in German as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaschau</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Originally a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hungarian city</span> , located in an <span class="REGION">area</span> which became part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> in 1918. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Invaded by <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in 1938, but returned to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">purpose what they did is when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went through... uh ...wide water...with a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> special stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Somehow, for some reason, we stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And we are over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I'm never gonna forget, my father should rest in peace he said, not yelling, just quietly, "I think this is it." </span><span class="sentence" id="99">He was sure that we are going to be thrown in in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stayed there for 5-10 minutes; and we were continue the travelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We don't know where we going, naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">After 3 days, we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">People call 1t <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because it's two separate...but it's only, I think, 2 miles separate from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to other. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">We arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We don't know where we arrived, but we were happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I mean, let me put it this way--I was fifteen years old, I did not realised. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But the grown up said, "At least we see <span class="BUILDING">baracks</span> and people around." </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Q.

</span><span class="sentence" id="174">I mean 1944, they knew that the war is lost for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But they wanted to kill as many Jews as possible in a hurry. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And they wanted to hide over there in the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> and when the Russians come to use all kind of heavy artillery to shoot from that...from the <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Matter of fact, my job...you see, I was still not 16 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So they had pity on me, the kapos, and I was...I was riding the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span> because they were little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> what carried the stone from the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> out. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And I was driving the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">It was simples ones, you know, so you didn't have to learn how to...and we carried the stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We dumped it and went back for more stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And one day I went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in the morning and I found out the bad news. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">My brother got hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Because he wanted to put together two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Not with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> what I was driving. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Somebody else was driving it. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And he didn't realize it, and the two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ...one was fill up with stones catched...the two bumpers catched his leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And that was bad news and I tell you why. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Because any little thing happened to a person like got very bad injury on the hand or on the leg, they didn't play too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">They amputate. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And the next day I came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from work and that was the news what they told me that your brother's leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I think it was right leg was amputated. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">But still he was in <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So I went to visit him every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">He never told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">That's something I never gonna forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">He never told me what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">He never showed me that his leg was amputated. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">He never told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I didn't talk about it and he didn't talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And that went on for a...4 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">But then the Russian came every day closer and closer to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had to be liquidated and they took away all the people from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Came <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> , and all the people in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was taken away...uh...and it was like a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> which has a <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> , because by us in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was no <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And they took them away, all of them from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and they got killed in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And after they left...a couple of days later, we started to march to march from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="209">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> has to be empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Matter of fact, sometimes we even heard with our ears the noise from the fighting...the Russians and the Germans, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Bombs or heavy artillery or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And they...we marched a full day, and we came again to a <span class="DLF">farm</span> with a big <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and...uh...that <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> could take normally...I'm talking about standing, never mind sitting or lying down, standing I would say about 2,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">The other thousand because we have three thousand. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">The other thousand was pushed in with a bayonet. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">You know, put in to the stomach and pushed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">The noise, the crying what went on all night, this was unbearable because... uh...anybody couldn't have no strength to stand fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">People stepped on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They opened the <span class="DLF">barn door</span> 8 o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">That time we realized what kind of night it was because they were carrying out from the <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> dead people...stepped on the body and dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Anybody couldn't...didn't have no strength to stand, they were just dead and taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">We marched another day and we came to a strain...<span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Their policy, the German policy, was, and that was general not particular but general policy of theirs was all the inmates...concentration camp inmates, summer time was carried in...1n closed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , in winter time open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">By that time it was winter and snow was coming down and we traveled for 3 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">We were sitting, laying, the snow was coming on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">No food. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Uh...we were passing by a big <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was below the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , and somehow...I don't know...a couple of people, civilians, knew...I don't know how...but some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ...some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , they threw in pieces of bread, but that was not enough for three thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And matter of fact, we arrived to a <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> ; but we didn't know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> is, because... Let's put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">There are two kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">There are <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> where people worked and they gave...they gave them food. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">You worked your 12 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">You go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and they let you to rest; you know, nobody bothered you. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And food...it was not enough, definitely; but at least it was enough to sustain you. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> ,’ and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> and these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> was just put up for killings. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">You know, the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> on the spot. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So we didn't know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> is, but all these places-- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gunskirchen</span> ’... All these...you see, that's the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where the Russians and the Americans got together because they're pushing from two <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , and that's the <span class="REGION">area</span> where they got together. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And every time from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> ...other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , they always emptied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and they were bringing them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> was a very, very big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but they couldn't kill so fast the people...as many people came...arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">So we're staying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...<span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , SS with big dogs * Subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . * </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">watching on us...they...we shouldn't jump down, you know, because it's still open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And we Stayed there for about 2 hours and and we traveled further and we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">After a 3 day traveling with an open...an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and snow felling on us, naturally, we stayed...it's called an appell. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">You know, we stayed in the <span class="DLF">line</span> over there in the...on the...they take...they took us in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And I'll never gonna forget... Naturally, we had no strength, so a lot of people sit down on the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And next to me was a man who laid down...and there was lot of dead people at that time among us...and one SS and two inmates was going around like a you call in English, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , you know, with...a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> to put on the dead people and take them to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And when they came to pick up the man laying next to me, the two inmates said to the SS, "He's still alive." </span><span class="sentence" id="251">The SS made a with the hand..."Forget about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Take him."

</span><span class="sentence" id="288">You see, they...the way they operated so that nobody could figure out what they have in mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">What happened...two weeks before the liberation, three SS came into our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and they said everybody has to stay in the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And we knew right away that those people who still able to work, they're gonna take them to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And those who are not able to work, they're gonna take them to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> or the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I'll never forget when it came mine...next, I begged them. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I showed it that I'm still able to work....they should take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">I begged them like a kid could beg somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And they did not take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So I was prepared that I'm going to get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">But after we found out, it was just a opposite way. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Because they knew the American are coming, and those who they think will die anyway, why...why bother to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">They're going to die anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Those who figured they could last more than two weeks, they took them...took them out, and they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">That's how I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">When I got liberated...it was a Sunday, 2 o'clock, and that time...not that time, a couple of days later, the Americans, you know, they started to take care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And they weigh us. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I weighed 70 pound. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">70 pound! </span><span class="sentence" id="306">But it looks like God wanted I should stay alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">What happened is Sunday afternoon they put up a big <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> in the open...the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And all we had to do 1s stand in the <span class="DLF">line</span> , and they didn't care how many times you are standing in the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">You finished eating, if you want to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> again, you get again hot soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So by...one day I had a little strength and I went in to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">It was...uh...1 don't know exactly...you had go over a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> ... would say about a mile...a mile and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And I didn't do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">A lot of people...they went in with friend, robbed, uh...the German families, you know, what they found. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Me, I was a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I didn't need nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">What do I need? </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So what I did is I went from one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to another eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Whatever they gave me, I was eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And about 10 o'clock I went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Because I lay down. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I lay down and while I was laying...excuse for the expression, I vomited the whole thing out. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">If that would have staying in, that would finish me. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So that's in general what I went through in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Naturally, there's stories I can tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And matter of fact, you ask me the story, but I can tell you...uh...you know, we have a book which it says if all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">oceans</span> would be ink and all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> would be pencils, wouldn't be enough to tell the whole story. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">But that's the general. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Then I stayed in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> about 4 weeks until a couple of us, we got liberated...uh...three people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">We decided we're going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">We don't know what we're gonna find, whom we're gonna find. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But we're going...we decided we're going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">There was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">There was no transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">We...when I say we...is a friend of mine...1t just happened he died last year...and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">We knew the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is going that direction toward the <span class="DLF">border</span> , and we sit...within two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , there's a round thing which locks together, you know, between the two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and we are sitting... He was sitting one one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and I was sitting on other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">We traveled 24 hours like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">During the night, our job was every half minute to watch on each other we shouldn't fall asleep because if we fell asleep, we fell down, and that's a goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We came after a whole night traveling like this...we came to a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I don't know which <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I don't remember it was still <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or

class="sentence" id="345">When it got...the light came on, it was day...daylight and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was staying in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , and I said to my friend, "I'm going to wash my face a little bit so freshen up a little bit." </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And I didn't know there was another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , full of SS, by the Russians taking...they took them to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And Russians, they were so violent. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">They didn't care SS, inmates going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you know...they so...people in that...1in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> ...middle of washing and a Russian soldier came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">He grabbed by the neck, and he showed me I should go in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">When I saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with the SS, it...my eyes blackened...what is this? </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I am just coming from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And I start crying and matter of fact, I showed him that piece of paper what I got when I got liberated by Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And usually the Russian soldiers, you know, if they would see a paper like this they don't...they don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Somehow the Russian soldier, he didn't know how to read it; and he gave it to one of the SS in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and he somehow explained to the Russian soldier that I'm just coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And he said, "Go." </span><span class="sentence" id="356">It didn't took...1t wouldn't take not too much that I would wind up in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> with...uh...with SS, you know, together with...with those people who killed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Because the Russians...matter of fact, a lot of Hungarian Jews after the liberation, they took them to <span class="COUNTRY">Siberia</span> ...<span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Because if they wanted 100 people, they didn't care who the 100 people is, as long as 100 people go. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">So after traveling...uh...nice couple of days, we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And by that time...you see...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> was liberated in January of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Because you see, the Russians coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , they're going to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and then to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So it took to May and the war...the second world war ended May 8. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I got liberated 2 days before the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Like I mentioned before that's...that's where the <span class="REGION">area</span> where they got together, the Russians and Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And when I arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , naturally, the first thing we did, my friend and myself, we found out there any Jews alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So they telled...they told us, "Yes, they's a...by the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish synagogue</span> there an organization where they're getting money from the United Jewish Appeal. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And everybody who goes there and say they are just coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> gets a couple of pengo...--like a dollar, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And we can continue our destiny wherever we wanta go (cough) go and...uh...we did continue and...uh..and I arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I found my brother in the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">He wanted to travel somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">With the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> as I arrived, he wanted to take the same training going further...the same direction where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">When he saw me, naturally, he didn't take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">You know, the happiness was unbelievable that I'm alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And later on, 5 months, but...I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the end of June. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">The communism in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> got stronger and stronger by the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And by November of 1945, they called in my brother, questioning him. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">From what he see, living, he's not working. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Where is he taking the money to live on? </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And the anti-Semitism was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">All we heard from the Gentiles...from neighbors where we lived together all our lives, they said to us, "How could it be...how could it be so bad? </span><span class="sentence" id="383">You came back more people than they took you. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">We came back from 35 families...we were together 105 people got deported, and we came back I think 6. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And they had the nerve to say, "How could it be so bad if you came...came back more people than they took you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="386">So I saw there's no future, and I went up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and over there they organized transport to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I didn't know that time what's in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but I know here's no good. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Here's no good so I have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I didn't...besides my brother I didn't find...our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was bombed from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">My parents never came...didn't come back and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I stayed there 2 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">But my life was...on the <span class="DLF">road</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we stopped in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and I wrote a letter to my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I said, "Look, they're helping us. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Come. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I don't know what's the future, but there's no future there. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Come." </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Matter of fact..uh..6 months later, he joined me in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I forget to mention to you...it's very...also a very tricky thing what they did to Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">When we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , they had...uh...sand...a pile...a big pile of sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And we were...they gave us cap...round cap. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">In the cap, we had to take the sand, the whole pile of sand, carry...uh...like a quarter of a mile. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Filled...everybody had to fill in the cap, empty it, and come back, empty it again...I mean fill it up again and carry it, and we had to make it fast because slow is no good. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Fast...we had to make it fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And next day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , they gave us post cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And we were so naive, so...we didn't know what's what, they gave us as many post cards we wanted to write to our parents, to our brothers, to our sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Our parents are dead already, but they give us...they gave us post cards to write. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">How...this how tricky they were, you know, just to fool people. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">You never know what they were up to. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And I stayed 2 years in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> and it was...maybe I didn't know how to approach, but it was very hard to get a visa to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because there were too many applicants. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Not only Jews, Gentiles....there was other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> with Gentiles also. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">They said they're also refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Polish, Russians, Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So after staying for 2 years, I...somebody told us there is a way somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">The way is to go west to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and from there we can take...we can apply for a student visa, going, studying. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">So I stayed 2 years in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Matter of fact, one of the Rabbis in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> gave me a paper that he's asking the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> to let me go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to study for a year and he's giving me a position as a assistant Rabbi in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And I got the student visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Naturally, I never went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Well, I got the visa for 1 year and after a year I didn't go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I'm not supposed to work, but...in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because I'm a student and I loved to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So what shall I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I have to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I have to pay where I stayed for the lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">So I took up a false first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And I took out a Social Security Card. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">5 minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Can you give us 5 minutes? </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Uh...you can help me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">QUESTION:  You were talking about going to work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  Yal. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">One evening...one evening I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work and this was around 6 o'clock and one lady who lived on the same <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> because I lived in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> , she run...she was waiting for me to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And she was so excited she didn't know to tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I said, "Tell me what happened?" </span><span class="sentence" id="438">She says, "Mr. Schwartz, what happened with you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I said, "Why?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="440">The FBI is looking for you." </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The FBI! </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So I knew right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I says...I forget already her name, Mrs. King. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Yal...Mrs. King. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I said, "Mrs. King, Don't worry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I guarantee it. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Believe me. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I didn't kill nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I didn't steal, and I know why they're looking for me." </span><span class="sentence" id="450">So 10 o'clock that evening the FBI showed up and they took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="451">But this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> , I tell you the truth was my second trip because when I arrived with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> as a student, they also took me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="453"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> , it's...I...you can't call it a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , but you were still locked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So they took me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> , and next day I had the right to call somebody so naturally, I called my brother and he got in touch with a gentleman who was doing this kind of work, putting up bails for people like me whom they took to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> , you know, as a student. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So he posted a $500 bond. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And I went...and I got freed from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I went back to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and I went back to work because I had no other...no other way than to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I called up somebody from the Democratic party in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , and he...they gave me a lawyer to take care of my papers. "</span><span class="sentence" id="459">Yes, Mr. Schwartz, I'm gonna work in behalf of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">But we have to go through a hearing on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I went through a hearing 4 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">The 4 hours consisted from 10:00 to 12:00 and from 2:00 to 4:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">They questioned me very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Mine answer was, "Listen, I can't help myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I have no <span class="NPIP">where</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I have no <span class="NPIP">where</span> to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="467">You see, that time there was not...not even an <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was established 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I says, "You can...you can't throw me out because I have no <span class="NPIP">where</span> to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And I was still young. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And so they told me that I have to go to any three <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> , representing three <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , and make application they should take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And I...I did made application, and... So we had to go back to the second hearing, and I told them nobody wants me. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And I cannot go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ; because if I go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , I facing the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">They questioned me all kind of questions...uh ... if.... They figured maybe I'm sympathizing with communists, and they asked me mine opinion about communism. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And I told them mine opinion is the Germans used to wear green shirt” and...uh... communists wear red shirts, but they are the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And I got permission to stay in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">After 2...2, 3 years I got mine green card. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">After that I got my citizen papers, and I'm thankful to the > Brown or black shirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="479"><span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to give me a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And I growed up a family...a nice family, and I make a nice living. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I would say about an average, and besides everyday troubles, I'm happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  That was very well done. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Can you tell me about the last few weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="484">What was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  There's no word for it...to describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">The cruelty and what we went through, because their function...when I'm talking about their function...the SS function, was the more people to kill because every day thousands and thousands of other inmates arriving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> because that was the <span class="REGION">area</span> where the Russians and American meet each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">You see, we were liberated May 6. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Two days later the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So it...that's where they met, the Russians and the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So their function was to kill as many people...as many people they brought in from all other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">But with all their technic...with all geniuses what they put in how to kill more Jews, they couldn't kill as fast as they were coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And there was no food whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Even the SS were going hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Even they were getting very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And naturally the human nature, those people who are still have a little strength to walk and we still went to work, and because we knew those people who are gonna say I have no strength to go to work gonna get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Without food. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">We got in the morning a little...I won't call it coffee...a little black colored water. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And people were so desperate, they were chewing coal, sucked coal, eating grass. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And I have to say it that they lost all humanity whatever you call it, and those people who died during the night and few of them they still had on their lower part some meat...some meat, when we got up in the morning, we saw those people dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">But the way they were carrying them, we saw that pieces of the body were missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And during the morning or after work, they made somehow a little fire, and they put it on like they say in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , they barbecued and they ate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I am very fortunate to say I never touched it. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">But there was a lot of them eating it. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And it was...1t was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">We got liberated May 6 in 1945 which came out a Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Saturday, they hanged 12 people in middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gallows</span> , and all those people who stayed who can still walk had to go march in front of them to see how they were hanging from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gallow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Another thing...very interesting thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Looked likes there was some...couple...not some, but a couple Germans who still couldn't take it what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">What happened is we got liberated Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Friday evening before we went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , there was a message from the Mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And the message was that we gonna go tomorrow morning...that means Saturday morning...from appell...appell it's called, you know, where you have to stand in the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And the SS gonna tell us that the Russians are very close and in order to get saved, we shouldn't get hurt, we all should go in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> was prepared...the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , you know, after you go in to bomb the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and we all gonna die there. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">So the Mayor sent a message that he don't know if it's gonna help or not, but when we gonna stand in appell Saturday morning and we gonna hear that speech, we should all start yelling with one voice, "We don't care if we gonna go....1f we gonna get killed, we're not gonna go nowhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">We're staying here." </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And it looks like they have got the strength...they didn't have the strength or the willingness to force us anymore because they know it's 1 day or 2 days left and we didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And that was fortunate who had still...uh...had to stand, stayed alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">But it was prepared to kill, and that was the easiest way to kill us, to go in the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> and...uh...bomb the...uh...<span class="DLF">gate</span> , you know, so all the stones would fell down from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , and we couldn't get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And they...maybe they would never find us. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">That we are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I don't know how many thousands people buried alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">But somehow the Mayor from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ebensee</span> sent us a message Friday evening that we shouldn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So that's the story of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">QUESTION:  Is there anything you want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">ANSWER:  Anything I want to add? </span><span class="sentence" id="527">It was...it cannot be described. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">It lasted 11 months, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">But it's...it's...J can't...1f I would be writer maybe I would write books but somebody would tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">There's only one problem with the book what ____ wrote. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">They way the say in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">They cover are too far apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">That's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  Thank you very much.</span></p>
