<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  Were you able to stay near your parents at all times?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  Oh yes, we were staying together all the time, they didn't separate us. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">They didn't separate the women with the men that time, but the Italian were there, they did not separate us. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I don't, what, yes, then of course, they, then, the Italian capitalit(ph), capitaleat(ph)? </span><span class="sentence" id="268">How do you pronounce it? </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I don't know how to pronounce it well. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And the Italian left and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was without anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And we had the choice to stay there or to leave and they had all the Slowena(ph), the Slowena(ph) were there, too, but not in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , that was a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="272">They were had, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> separate and the other one separate, we had nothing in common, but I know it was there and the Italian left and so we left to the city of Robb(ph) and were sleeping there a little bit and then we decided about, we didn't know where to go, so we went to the mainland of <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Some people were smart enough and left to ===. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">~We didn't know where to leave, so that's what we did, we went to the mainland, to <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> and it was occupied by the partisan and we walked and walked until we could sleep somewhere and over there it was, partly, that part where we went, it was occupied by the partisan, because otherwise the Germans would have gotten us, we would have been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And some people went a different direction and then I never heard about them any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Some people stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I heard everybody in, who stayed there, that didn't come out alive, that's what I heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And, and we were escaping and escaping and sometimes we got some food from the peasant because the partisan were there and I don't know what to say, what else, maybe you want to ask me something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  When you were at Robb(ph) still, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> there and the Italians capitulated, what did you know, or what did you hear about the war at that time, had you been hearing a lot about the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  We didn't read the paper, we couldn't read the paper and we were, we heard, we hoped that we will be saved, but we did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Of course we did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I know the Italian left, but I forgot what I heard that time, really, I forgot. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I couldn't tell you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">QUESTION:  How did you decide that you needed to leave Robb(ph), before you knew, I'm assuming you did not know that the Germans were coming there, how did you decide to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  I guess I heard people talking, we heard people talking and we didn't know if we should go or not, but that's what we decided, what the group of our people decided to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">There was not knowing, because when we would have known something, a lot of people would have been saved, but we didn't know what we should do and what we did, it was just luck, to come out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  How large was the group of you that decided to leave?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  Of course, we walked and walked, constantly walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And one time, we were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we did not, we were staying there for awhile, it was taken over by the partisan. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I mean, the whole thing was taken from the partisan, because otherwise I wouldn't be here, but, what was I going to say, it's, when they, I wanted to say that we got to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and we had to, we heard that we have to escape and my parents were <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and, no, they came <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and my father said he forgot something and we were waiting and waiting he should come out and everybody was escaping already and we were scared and we didn't see my parents and I was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">They may have left and went another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So we decided about it, we going. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So I went with a friend and we walked and other people we knew also, from our group and we walked, but we did not know where, we just walked and then later on, we came to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , which was also from the partisan, like. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I think it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Serb's village</span> , I don't know, but they took us in and registered us, so I think it was the partisan, registered us in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and it just happened that my parents were, heard our name and were also going the same way and so that's when we found my parents again. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And then we were staying there for awhile and then we had to leave too and I think that time, we, I think we had to leave, we were told to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">There was a time, they were very nice to us, they gave us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We had, that time, we were not even so hungry and we had to leave the people who were around there, I don't know the reason, but I think, you hear that time, you heard that time, you have to leave, so we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Our group left, it was a group, I don't know how many people, I couldn't say, but maybe it was 100. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Anyway, we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They were not all in that one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , but we found them anyway and we left and we walked and walked, we didn't know, it was snowing, it was terrible snowing and we walked and walked and walked and some people of course, had very bad feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I was one of the luckies, I still had the good shoes and they still were good that time, but we went, that time, we end up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chaplina(ph</span> ) I think, that time, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Let me think, I don't know if...
QUESTION:  Was this in the wintertime? </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Of 1943?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  I think, when we walked and escaped that time, that I, not only I think, I know it was winter, it was snowing very hard and I don't know even how we could have gone that time, because we didn't know where we could sleep, but we went and then we end up to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and I think that was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ), I've, when I'm not wrong, it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vookavitch(ph</span> ) and we could sleep there and for a while, we were sleeping there and that I do remember and that was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ), or was it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> )? </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And later on we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ), that I do remember and that was all occupied by the partisan and then it was, or was it that we first went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ) and then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vookavitch(ph</span> ), I really do not remember, maybe, no, no, no, I think first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vookavitch(ph</span> ), then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We had lice that time, we were, you know, run down. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">We were afraid of lice, because we heard that some people died from Typhus and you know, that's how you get it, from the lice on the clothes, but we tried to get as clean as possible, every morning we were looking for lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And we were sleeping in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vookavitch(ph</span> ) on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of course, and we had very little to eat, I remember my mother made spinach that time, from leaves and very little to eat, but, you know, when we had something, we took sometimes something out from our stuff what we had, what we carried, in order to get some food, you know, everything would have been worse, a lot of money, for, not money-wise, I mean for food to get, that's all, who cared, nobody had money that time, we just were looking for food, but we had very little clothes to exchange, we had very little, but once in awhile we took something out to get something to eat besides what we got from the partisans and what else did we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We had, then we went also to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ) and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ) and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ), we went to, no, that time they went Toposco(ph) and we, that time, Churchill's son, but I don't know if Churchill was there and the German were bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ) for that reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And we also had escaped there...

QUESTION:  Mrs. Barber, you were telling me about being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ), will you tell me a little bit more?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  It was, we got from, I guess it was from the partisan that we got some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">We were, that time we were not so hungry, but we had not much to eat, we were in, living in, you know, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we all slept, we didn't have different <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> you know, but a few people were sleeping there. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And during the day, sometimes the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German airplanes</span> came and we were scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And nearby was <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and I escaped, most of the time I was during the day there, in order because, I was afraid they may bomb Toposco(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="321">But later on I remember, I mean I know that Randolph Churchill was there, so we felt safe already, but we heard that we have to escape because I guess the German wanted to take over that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I think he had to escape the same time and I'm, I'm sure he did, so we didn't know where we were walking and walking and walking and we, I think the name of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> was <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Petrovagorra(ph</span> ) and we were sleeping there for a few days and it was, the peasant came there and some people had something and we were, some people took a coat and in order to get a glass of milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">It was that bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">But after a few days, when we were in the, in the Petrovagorra(ph), we were back to, I think it's Vookavitch(ph) or to Toposco(ph) we're back, no to Toposco(ph) we went back, not to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vookavitch(ph</span> ), I forgot that, I really, but anyways, Toposco(ph) and Vookavitch(ph) is so nearby that yes, no, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ) we went back, it was maybe another time, I really don't, I don't remember, so I shouldn't say, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So, what else I should tell you, I don't know what.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  Well what was your next memory of <span class="NPIP">where</span> you were, whichever <span class="NPIP">place</span> it was, what was going on next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  We were a long time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ), I don't recall exactly how long we were and this I do remember and then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleena(ph</span> ), which is also, I think it is 13 kilometer from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ) and my, my parents were that time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ), but I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleena(ph</span> ) and I was only hoping, you know, during the night, we heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> going to, going to wherever they went, to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , whatever and we were so glad, because we were hoping that pretty soon the war is finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">That's all I can tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Every day was, we were scared to be, you know, to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">But of course, not from the, from anybody else, we were scared that German may take over, that was the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  Did you have a lot of contact with partisans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  Not really, but they helped us, because when they wouldn't have been there, I wouldn't be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Before, there were the Italian, then it was the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">But we didn't have any contact whatsoever then, they gave us food, they gave us some food, you know, to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And they gave, they brought us to <span class="BUILDING">peasant homes</span> where we were sleeping and they had to give us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Not much, but anyway, something to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And when you ask me now how I survived, I really don't know how, how we could survive without money, without anything, only with help from other people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">QUESTION:  I want to back up just a little bit, when you were coming from Robb(ph), back to the mainland and it sounds like there were many small <span class="NPIP">places</span> that you traveled through and I, I don't expect you to remember the exact names of each <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but what was it like going from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Where were you staying each <span class="NPIP">place</span> and how long, days, weeks, were you traveling before getting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> )?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">ANSWER:  We were walking and walking and I really don't, sometimes we were staying with peasant, we were walking, we walked, but we didn't know where we can sleep and then when they found the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we could lay down and sleep, it was just a <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of course, we were glad we could sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , because that's all we did, I mean they, they didn't have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> that time, there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">We never thought so, when we had straw, I think you call it straw and they had straw once in a blue moon, that was really something good to sleep on, but most of the time on plain <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> we went through, some of them were, most of them, some of, most of them, some of them, were burned out <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , so we couldn't go in in those burned out <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , we could not. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">So we were looking for something where we could sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And when we found something, we stayed awhile, as long as we could, til we had to escape again and we know, that time, when we get caught, that we are not going to be alive, so, but nobody knew which way to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">A lot of people disappeared, we never know, we never heard anything any more about those people, because they didn't know where to go, or maybe they stayed at <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we left and they got caught from the Ustershur(ph), German, I don't know who killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">They were not better than the Germans, they were just, I couldn't say just as bad because I don't know, but I think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  Walking from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> , how large of a group were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  We never counted, but I think it was 100, something in that order, that time already, because that time I think a few people were just disappearing, a few stayed in Robb(ph) and they never came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Not as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I was told that everybody who stayed was killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  And so perhaps a group as large as 100 of you, were arriving to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and then trying to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and many <span class="NPIP">places</span> to stay in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , 1s that how you were going about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  Oh, we were parting, each, you know, in a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> and different, sometimes we found a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you know, but when it was small <span class="NPIP">places</span> , I think they were sleeping four or five, in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and the others were sleeping in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , that's how they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ), they were already a big, bigger group together, because we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ), but then I went also to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleena(ph</span> ) and there were a few people from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> who were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleena(ph</span> ) and there was a time when in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleena(ph</span> ), we couldn't even go out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleena(ph</span> ) because there was Typhus in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleena(ph</span> ) and they didn't let anybody move out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleena(ph</span> ), so we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleena(ph</span> ), which is nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toposco(ph</span> ), also a small, I don't think you call it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but maybe they call it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I don't know what else, what should I tell you, what else should I tell you?</span></p>
