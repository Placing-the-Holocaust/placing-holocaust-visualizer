<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  What were your feelings as a child then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  I didn't understand what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I think if I would be, older, I would commit...commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I couldn't go through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Then I thought it is not real. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I think because I had my mother, I had my father and you know, I was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">What's the difference? </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I...a child don't understand much. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Also, I was pretty mature I must say for my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But we was going from the work back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and...and that's the way we lived until the final call. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">The final call was November... November. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">What does it mean the final call? </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I'll explain to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">There was <span class="NPIP">outside</span> a big, big sign: ALL PEOPLE, ALL JEWS HAVE TO GATHER TOGETHER AND TAKE THEIR BEST THINGS, THEIR BEST THINGS, AND WHATEVER IN SACKS, INRUCKSACKS, WHATEVER BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A DIFFERENT, TO A DIFFERENT <span class="NPIP">PLACE</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So we didn't make a deal out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It's supposed to be the next morning, 5 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So I remember overnight, my father took...told us to take a pillow case with towels to make a rucksack. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">A rucksack...how do you say in English, a rucksack?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  That's right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  A rucksack. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And we put all our best things there because we believed that we are going to transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salaspils</span> , what...what was a bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So we was peacefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">We didn't think that we are going to be harmed or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I mean there was plenty of killings all the time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Because you see some parents lived there in this <span class="REGION">section</span> and the children live in the other <span class="NPIP">section</span> , and the parents and the children wanted to move together. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So if you are out after 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock, they kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And it was shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I remember...I hear remember the whole night was shooting and shooting and shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">People was sounds of...of...of shooting people, and that was people who wanted to run around to my daughter or I will run to my dad or to my brother, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">People...people wanted to get together or to go to that new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And so we also sewed the whole night. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">My mother, my sister and me, we sewed all the time the sacks and put the best things. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Because...not because we...we just wanted to exchange for bread because bread was the biggest thing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">It's like a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Because we was constantly, constantly hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And then 4 o'clock in the morning, the Germans came armed with...with the whips and "Raus, Raus, Raus.” </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They screamed all the time, "Raus.” </span><span class="sentence" id="138">This mean "Get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Get out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And so they...they threw us all out in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> where we sit together altogether these people to gather together. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">There we...we tried to be together because my father had a brother there, Uncle Arthur with his wife and two children, my cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So we was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We tried to stay together. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We wanted to live all to...because my father was very close to his brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">That's the only brother he ever had. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And then when all the people was...you know, there was screams and yells and the...the...the tragedy was that the...the men who was capable to work, they couldn't go with their wives or with their mothers or with their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They was putting in in a special little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">They called that the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">There was...this was called a man's...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">man's ghetto</span> , but in my... in my particular <span class="DLF">line</span> in that thing where we...we was was mostly old people, old women, mothers with children, with little children. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">There was a mother who had a baby on her hand and three children on her...holding on on her because her husband was in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And you know, when we passed by we saw them and they were screaming and calling names and...my wife, my child...you know, by their name, "Frieda, Frieda, Sascha, Manya, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They...they...because we...we was gathered altogether 1n a...on the Chaussee, on the big Chaussee to go somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We didn't know where we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">We thought we are going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salaspils</span> to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We...we hoped so. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So we was in that big <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">There was 30,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">30,000 people! </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They only later somebody told me that there in this particular aktion was 30,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">There was two aktions 1n...in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I was in the first, but then was in December the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Now I am going to just tell you about the first aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">This is what happened in the first aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So we was on that Chaussee. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">There was blood and snow in November. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">You know, it snowed and I remember it was squashing, squish, squish... blood and snow, blood and snow, and there was...you know, on the side was people. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I...I thought it's...1t's wood, but this was not wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">That was dead bodies piled up on each other like a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I say...from the...because it was 4 o'clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">It was dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">You couldn't even see real good. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So then I saw these are people. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">That was not wood at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So we straightened out on that...that Chaussee...I think it was 10 people in...in a row, you know, like...as...as breit [broad] as the Chaussee, I think it was 10 or 9 people or I cannot remember really. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And it was a big, big <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">We was one of the last ones who...who was who was joining that...that <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And we start walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">On each <span class="NPIP">side</span> was German, Latvian, so...so Nazis, with their Totenkopf, with the dead skull on their hat, and with a...with a...with a...with revolvers. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">How you call that? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">With guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">On each <span class="NPIP">side</span> , you know, and with the...with the whips. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Go. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Go. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Schnell Schnell, you know, because there was old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They couldn't walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The little children crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">They...it was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">It was freezing. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">They wanted Mama, Mama, Mama. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And the Mama has a baby on her...on her...this 1s... cannot explain to you what that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">It is disgusting. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">You just looked, and you couldn't understand what...what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So when we was walking about maybe a half an hour, suddenly from the first <span class="DLF">line</span> ...from the first <span class="DLF">line</span> , we heard that we are turning in on left. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Turning in, not going straight because I don't know, but people knew where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salaspils</span> is. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">This 1s a different, total different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We was turning in...in the left and from the first <span class="DLF">road</span> the people was screaming, "We are not going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salaspils</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">They are going to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">They are taking us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rumbula</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rumbula</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I didn't even know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rumbula</span> is then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rumbula</span> is <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So the first <span class="DLF">line</span> , surely the Germans people start screaming and yelling and some people was running, starting running and as they were shoot on the spot, so the...the whole group...the whole 30,000 people left in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , in that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rumbula woods</span> till I saw what it was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Because we were one of the last ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Not...not really, but almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">There was already a...a Yama...how do you say
