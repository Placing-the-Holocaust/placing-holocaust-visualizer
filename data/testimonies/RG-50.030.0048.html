killed, to go to the <span class="DLF">grave</span> in your young age, you can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">That is your choice." </span><span class="sentence" id="756">But she said, "I don't like to be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And I am too young to be buried." </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And she said, "No, I am sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I will not help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I will not take Jews and help, because that 1s death." </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And I said, "Ok, Mary. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">If you don't like, maybe I will not take also." </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And I told her, "Mary, please don't tell -- don't mention to nobody." </span><span class="sentence" id="764">She said, "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I already got amnesia. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">I already forget everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Everything gone from my head and my mind." </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">So Joe came in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I told him how Mary refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">He said, "Well, ok." </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I said, "Well, maybe I will take by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I will look for <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And I looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I didn't know really where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">But I look. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And Joe advised me to go there, where was mostly <span class="DLF">Jewish street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">And now was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">That. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Maybe there you will find <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Was really empty, whole <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="785">But was every <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , I running up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Was no <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , was no <span class="DLF">doors</span> , was no <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">No nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So I thought, "Well, <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> is not necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">But <span class="DLF">doors</span> and <span class="DLF">windows</span> , that is necessary!" </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Then I looked -- oh, sorry, then I looked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">If I will find some <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> there, I will take in these people where I will hide him, them. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">But was not <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I thought, "Maybe from another <span class="BUILDING">building</span> I will take some <span class="DLF">windows</span> , some <span class="DLF">doors</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="794">But was no-- nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">You see, I went out and I stood on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I thought, "Where to go now?" </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I didn't know where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And I was frightening a little, so ghostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">You were laughing, really, but I heard a voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I heard a voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">When I stood and thinking, and I asked, "Dear God, where I supposed to go now to look for <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Where?" </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I looked around, and was a little scared because was nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And then I heard the voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Some voice told me, "Don't be afraid, and go a little farther there. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">After this corner, there 1s standing two women, women who clean the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and they are supporting on the brooms. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And ask them for <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="808">They will tell you." </span><span class="sentence" id="809">So I was listening; and then I said, "Well, what is with ordinary women who clean the <span class="DLF">street</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="810">What they will know about <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And this voice said to me, "Go and ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">They will know. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">They will tell you." </span><span class="sentence" id="814">So I still thought, "Well, what they will know?" </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And this voice again told me, "Go. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Please go." </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And I felt like a little pushed, and said, "Go and ask, and ask for a janitor there." </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And I said, "All right, all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">What I can lose?" </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And I am going exactly this way, like this voice told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And aft-- after the corner, and I saw two women, and they are, they were talking together and supporting on the brooms, ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">I approached them. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And I asked, "Ladies, maybe you know

id="830">And one of them, she said, "Oh, 1s <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Tatarska (ph) 3. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">You go this
