<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Today is June 12, 1992. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">I am here with Mrs. Miki Pear of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Franklin Lakes</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , and she is here at the United States Memorial Holocaust Museum today to tell her story of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Good afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> on May 14, 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My father was a violinist and a professor of music. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">My mother came from a very large family -- my father was an only child as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">He had a tiny family. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My mother came from an enormous and very well known family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , a very prominent family. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">My grandfather had a soda, carbonated beverage manufacturing family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  On your mother’s side?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  My mother’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I don’t know very much about my father’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I know only that he came from a family of intellectuals, professors, linguists and I don’t know what all. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I do remember his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I remember meeting them once. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I remember going to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I remember the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that I was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I remember that there was a red oriental rug, very highly patterned, intricately patterned and the <span class="DLF">walls</span> were lined with books.. That was very impressive because first of all, I had never seen anything quite like it and second of all because my father’s parents, like my father, were very short. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">They were even much shorter than my father was. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I remember that --the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> so clearly because I remember thinking how do they reach those books which went so high up. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">The <span class="DLF">ceilings</span> in Europe were very high and I don’t remember and I was very small.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  Were you crawling on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rug</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  No, I was walking on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rug</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I had to be four years at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I remember thinking how could my grandfather who was so pale and delicate looking climb? </span><span class="sentence" id="24">There were <span class="DLF">ladders</span> on each side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , which I guess must have been on wheels or however those things worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">But I remember imagining how could my grandfather who looked so frail and tiny reach those books. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">That’s the impression that I have of my grandparents and I remember absolutely nothing else about them nor do I know anything about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Only that my father was an only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">However, my mother’s side of the family, I remember very clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And they were exactly the opposite in every conceivable way. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">They were very loud and noisy and gregarious. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">My mother was the youngest of eight siblings. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">There were nine originally, one died at a young age, maybe in childhood, I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">But she was one of five daughters, she was the youngest, and three sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">The oldest child was a daughter, the oldest child, my mother’s sister, married a physician who was her childhood sweetheart and they moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">This would have to have been in the twenties. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">They had two daughters who I know became -- one became a merchant ship captain, captain of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">merchant ship</span> and the other daughter, this would have been my cousin, became, I believe, a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">But that entire part of the family was lost to the other, to the rest of the family because they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So I know nothing ...
QUESTION:  Soviet citizens?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  --Soviet exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So I don’t know any more about them but I imagine that these two cousins, anyway, who would probably be twenty or thirty years older than I am, might still be living. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I imagine my cousin is a sea captain, provocative thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Hopefully their descendents are living somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and hopefully they’re enjoying a peaceful life. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">The rest of the brothers and sisters -- all the sisters married and all of my mother’s sisters, all four of my mother’s sisters had families of three or more children. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And all of those families perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Of the three brothers, the oldest was banished to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> with his wife and child. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">He survived the war and it was he who later found me where I was hidden in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , where I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">The other two brothers -- the middle brother escaped sometime during the first World War and the story goes that he was, what’s the word? ... </span><span class="sentence" id="48">He punched a senior in the jaw for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  This is in the Russian army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  In the Polish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">He was in the Polish cavalry. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">The Polish cavalry during the first World War was kind of interesting because if you could afford your own boots, or at least this is what I am told, if you could afford a fancy uniform with boots and so forth, you sort of automatically became an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">If you could afford to bring your own horse, you became an officer in the cavalry. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So he was a horseman and he had the means to afford all this grand stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So he was an officer in the Polish cavalry. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">He was quite rebellious and kind of a smart ass and apparently he got into some, I don’t know, fracas, and punched out a senior officer and they were going to shoot him for insubordination. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">He jumped over the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , I don’t know, I may be romanticizing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">These are facts that I was told and eventually escaped and made his way to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where there was some distant relative who took him under his wing. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Morris Berliner, this middle uncle became in later years, the rich uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He’s the one that we came to, he was our sponsor in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">The youngest of my three uncles who was just the next sibling to my mother, my mother was the younger and he was next; he was Martin Berliner. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">He and his bride -- he was a student in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> -- he went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> there and became an engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">He and his new bride were fortunate enough to have come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1939 on the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> which was admitted into New York harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So he was a surprise to us when we arrived here because we had no idea of his whereabouts at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  You had known him before you left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Possibly. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I don’t remember him at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Hard to keep track of all your uncles?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Well. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Also he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">He was a student in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Although he was very close with my mother because they were closest in age, I didn’t know him. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Or if I knew him, it would have been only very casually, very briefly. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">But my uncle Jacob, the oldest was closest in the family to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">The two were each other’s confidant, they were friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">They were friends, socially. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">They just had a very close friendship even though they were a number of -- quite a number of years apart, perhaps fifteen years apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And he was her protector and he loved her a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  He had remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Yes, he remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and he remained in my grandfather’s business. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He ran the finances of the business and apparently one of the reasons that he was so -- that he did that is because he was so honest and so trustworthy and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">He was the kind of the controller and the business head of the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">My grandfather was part inventor, entrepreneur and dreamer and my grandfather ... For example, my grandfather was the first to introduce fresh fruit juice or syrup to carbonated water. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">That juice was raspberry and he was at the beginning of creating fruit flavored soft drinks, sparkling soft drinks. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">The fledgling company which he called Fraise, the French word for raspberries because that was the first fruit flavoring that he experimented with, with his carbonated water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Did you get to drink any?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  I don’t remember at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I don’t remember that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But I remember that life at my grandparent’s kind of revolved around the siphons. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I remember their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- I have wonderful memories of my grandparents’ <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and here comes the lump in my throat. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">My grandparents’ <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was sort of on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">My uncle Martin, the youngest of the brothers, was interviewed for a book, ‘Voices of the Holocaust’ and I believe, in that interview is the -- if not the address, the location of, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I’m not very good with the names and the <span class="NPIP">places</span> because I was so young. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But that information is known. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And apparently my grandfather, who was extremely tall, unusually tall, he was the tallest member of the entire family. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">My grandmother was quite small and she had beautiful blue eyes, she was the only one with blue eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">She had a beautiful singing voice which could have been operatic but she preferred just to share her singing talents with her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">She was the family songbird. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">She sang all the time as she cooked and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My grandfather was extremely, highly respected in the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">He was sort of the unofficial Jewish mayor of the <span class="REGION">area</span> and was the ... He was the one who kind of communicated with the official government and the gentile community. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">He was the -- I can’t think of the word. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Well, anyway —
QUESTION:  Community leader.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Yes, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Well, more than that, he was also kind of the wise man. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">People came to him for advice and he settles disputes. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">He loaned people money. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He was very loved and respected.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  An elder statesman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  He was truly that and looked the part too. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">He was a great big tall man with a white beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Oh, and I have a wonderful photograph of them too, if your archives might be interested, of my grandfather and grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Oh,G__, They’re gorgeous!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Was your family orthodox?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  I believe my grandparents were ...
QUESTION:  On your mother’s side?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Yes, I know really nothing about my father’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Everything I’ve told you is everything I know and there is no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But my -- I think my grandparents were probably orthodox . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I don’t know that but I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">My grandmother also has a wonderful reputation. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">She took the teachings of the Torah rather literally in some respects. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Every Friday and on every holiday, she would go and collect beggars from the <span class="DLF">street</span> and she would feed them in her <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">On the high holy days, she invited them to share our holiday meal in our <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I remember my grandmother’s dining which because she had eight children, all of whom were married and had children of their own; the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> could seat I don’t know how many people, maybe twenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I remember the beautiful crystal chandelier which hung over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I remember a little story of a peasant from the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> who came to work as a sort of maid, or I don’t know, helper, and my grandmother told this servant to go and turn out the light in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">When the servant didn’t reappear for a long time, my grandmother went to search and found this peasant standing on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> trying to blow out the electric lights in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chandelier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So I remember little antidotal facts like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Stop me from telling you these stories because it will take me forever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="BUILDING">home</span> did you live in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Well my father was a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He taught at one of the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I really am not sure which, either the <span class="BUILDING">University of Warsaw</span> -- there were two <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I think he might have taught in the smaller of the two because there was great anti-Semitism at that time and difficulty within the university system. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So he might not have taught in the <span class="BUILDING">Warsaw University</span> but I’m not really sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">In any case, he also gave private lessons at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">My father was not successful in the <span class="DLF">field</span> of making money. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He was kind of a disappointment and disgrace within the family because my mother’s family was all very aggressive and very well to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Everybody did exceedingly well and apparently they thought that that was very important and everyone was talented in a different way but everyone was sort of well off. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">My mother was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">It was very disappointing to the family that my mother married my father because she married him on the rebound. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">She had been in love with a local boy who apparently was a great Zionist and gave her the choice of -- or asked her to go with him to build <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">When she refused to leave the <span class="BUILDING">family nest</span> and go to such a <span class="NPIP">faraway place</span> , he left without her. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I’ve often wondered which hero in the State of Israel might have been my mother’s childhood sweetheart and so I romanticize about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Anyway on the rebound my mother married one f her teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">My father was quite a bit older than my mother and it was against my mother’s family’s wishes that she rebelliously married him. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I was their only child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">QUESTION:  How long had they been married before you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  Well, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">My mother was very young so I imagine they were just married a a short time and I was their first child. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">In 1939 when I was four, I remember with great clarity, the blitzkrieg. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I mentioned that my grandparents lived on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in a section, the name of which I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And we lived, my mother and father and I, in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that I can describe to you in detail, the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> and, in fact, a little bit of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> too, but I won’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">In any case -- well, I'll describe only this much. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">That it was a <span class="BUILDING">red brick building</span> and was built with a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> inside but I think a lot of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in Europe were. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">That there were <span class="DLF">iron gates</span> through which you entered the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">The <span class="DLF">gate</span> , the handle of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> was a monkey’s paw. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I don’t even know though if that’s all that unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But I remember that clearly and I remember that gypsies came and entertained and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gypsy wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">The people leaned out of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and looked down into the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and threw coins down. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I remember that very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">The circus troupe came and I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I remember looking out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I remember that a <span class="DLF">line</span> was strung from <span class="DLF">window</span> to <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I looked out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> one morning and a ballerina was walking on a rope, right in front of my <span class="DLF">window</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Across the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Across the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I remember that she held an umbrella and she smiled at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I looked down and there was a bear standing on its hind legs and clowns. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It’s such a clear memory, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  A visiting circus?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  A visiting circus in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And the people threw down coins and that’s how they were paid, these itinerant entertainers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  Do you remember whether this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> or was it mixed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  I don’t know, I really don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I wouldn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">In any case. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I do remember that there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> to my grandparent’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> , there was a kind of circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> was turned on a -- like a lazy susan. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And that -- that was the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Then the <span class="BUILDING">terminal</span> was near you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  That was where we lived, at the end of this <span class="DLF">trolley line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">We went all the way to the other end of the <span class="DLF">trolley line</span> where there was another turn-a-round. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Within a walk from there was where my grandparents lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So I could probably look on an old map of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and identify where both <span class="BUILDING">dwellings</span> were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  I have one such map downstairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  You do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">QUESTION:  We’ ll look this up after ---.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  I'd like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  During the break.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Oh dear, -----
QUESTION:  We’re talking about your <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ...

<p><span class="sentence" id="455">ANSWER:  Practical, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">She said come, it’s raining, it’s beginning to rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">We started to go toward the -- where our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">horse cart</span> was, and we began to walk in a <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">The adults held up the blankets over our heads -- made like a <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> of blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">The little boy and I and there were several other children who were older and who had gone into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> with the mushroom pickers. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">We were among their feet, you know, underneath the blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">The taller adults held the blankets aloft over us on the four corners. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Huge drops of rain and possibly hail began to fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">With that, two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> came flying out of the <span class="DLF">sky</span> and strafed us and began to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">We scattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">They made a pass and my mother said, I remember my mother screaming something like the blankets wouldn’t protect us from bullets, scatter. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">We began to scatter and I wound up in a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">When the excitement of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> and the noise and the bombs or whatever ended, the little boy who had been picking berries with me was lying dead next to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So that’s an anecdote.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">QUESTION:  And you still didn’t know why or what or who?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">ANSWER:  No, I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I did understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">You know, it’s like nobody ever explained the facts of life to me, nobody ever had a sex talk with me but I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Nobody ever explained the war to me, but I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I was old before my time and understood without explanation. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I don’t think I ever asked a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I remember men disappearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I remember the gathering of jewelry to pay some kind of ransom. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Somebody was imprisoned -- Zuckerman! </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Dr., Professor Zuckerman, we had to... My mother gave some jewelry and we collected jewelry because he was detained. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">We never did get him back. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Shortly after that, my father went foraging for food somewhere and he was in a <span class="DLF">farmer’s field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">They went to steal food from a <span class="DLF">farm</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I remember my father coming back and saying that the soldiers were running -- were chasing them and that he hid in a furrow, you know....
QUESTION: <span class="DLF"> Irrigation ditch</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  Or something, I don’t know, in a furrow on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> between the rows of whatever was growing. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And that a soldier stepped on the brim of his cap and very soon after that, my father disappeared and my mother said that he had left and that he would send for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">My mother and I were left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I remember asking my mother, many, many times, when will father come for us or send for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">She always answered in exactly the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">It’s really one of the half dozen Polish words that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">She always said, Crusscoov and that means soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">But of course, he never came. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Then my mother and I moved to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and I wishtoG___I could tell you where. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">But that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  So you never returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  No, no, we never returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Oh, I remember, another incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">My parents and I were on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Several of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> fell down into a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and there were many dead and screaming andG____ knows what. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">We were in the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I think that was the only one that was left standing on the <span class="DLF">track</span> and was not hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Anyway my mother and I were alone and we wound up in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , probably in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , and very near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where I was ultimately to be hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">My mother supported us, it’s a terrible word. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I mean she provided the little we had by knitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I know that sounds ridiculous but my mother would take your old sweater with the holes in the elbows and she would rip out the yarn and out of that torn, holey sweater, she would make you a vest or a short sleeve sweater or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">She knitted day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I remember listening to my mother’s knitting needles, even in the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">My mother smoked. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I remember seeing her cigarette in the dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">My mother was an exceptional knitter and she could knit in the dark without having to look. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I remember going into <span class="BUILDING">bomb shelters</span> during air raids and my mother would say to me, I’m here, just listen to my needles and you know I’m here. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">You needn’t be afraid as long as you hear my needles. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">If she wasn’t knitting, she was smoking. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">She’d say, watch, that’s my cigarette. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I would watch her face suddenly light up as se took a puff of her cigarette. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">But most of the time she was knitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">She knitted all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">She would ask me to hold out my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">When she ripped a sweater, she would wind the yarn around my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">My two outstretched hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Then she would wind it into a ball from my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I remember holding out my hands and getting very tired and complaining a great deal but that was how she supported us. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I know that at night, she would sneak out after the curfew and she would go to the parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where she wasn’t allowed to go be, to deliver her goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">One time she took me with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">That was rare, usually she left me back in our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with my teddy bear, my David, my treasured possession. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">She took me with her into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and she said she was taking me to a lady who, I must be very careful and I must not speak only to say please and thank you and to be very polite, other than that to not speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">If I’m asked a question only to say yes and no and not to say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Because where we were going was very dangerous but this was a very generous lady and she would probably serve tea and cake or cookies. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">That was why my mother was going to take a chance and take me because we might get something very delicious to eat, or jam, jam. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So we went and we crossed into a section that I don’t remember by what means or what but I know we weren’t allowed o be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">We went into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I just seem to remember that it was a white <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it had a <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">We went <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and inside was a very cozy <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , a cozy <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with lovely upholstered <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and a lot of pillows. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and it had a shawl over it and a beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vase</span> filled with flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">There were photographs and there were a lot of pictures and paintings and things on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">We sat on an upholstered, lovely carved settee with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in front. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Just as my mother had predicted, this lady brought out a tray with a tea service on it with cookies and jam and toast and wonderful things. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I ate and oh it was so wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  You hadn’t had anything like that in a while?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  I hadn’t had anything like that, my G__! </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Oh, it was so wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">With that the lady said to my mother, come into my <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and I’Il show you what I made. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">It turned out that this lady was a -- well she did beautiful needlework. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">She did these pictures which were framed which were both embroidered and appliquéd. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">For example, there was one -- well I’Il tell you about that one because it almost caused our death. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Also the reason she called my mother into another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> 1s because this lady also made dolls which were fully clothed adult dolls but they were apparently anatomically correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So she showed this lovely doll but then invited my mother into this next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> so that she could undress this male doll and show my mother that it had all its anatomical parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Well, while my mother and this lady were out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> I turned and looked at the <span class="DLF">wall</span> behind me on which hung a picture that this woman had also made. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">The picture was of a sort of <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> and a <span class="DLF">yard</span> filled with chickens and there were flowers against the <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> and there were little <span class="DLF">windows</span> with shutters and a <span class="DLF">door</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">There was a girl throwing feed from an apron, just like I had described before, throwing seed out to chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">There were chickens all over, feeding and flying around and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">All of this was appliquéd and embroidered and so on and very intricate. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Suddenly I realized to my horror or fascination that the girl feeding the chickens had a yellow star on her chest. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">When my mother came out of the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with this lady, I absolutely couldn’t help but point it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Look she has a yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">With that this woman flew into a rage, pointed a finger at my mother and said, you did that, it wasn’t there before, you’re responsible, you did that! </span><span class="sentence" id="556">She screamed out of the <span class="DLF">door</span> for the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">My mother and I ran out. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">There were two police and I can’t tell you what they were but I think they had brown....
QUESTION:  Brown uniforms?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  Brown uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">That’s -- I think -- my memory serves me -- they were brown. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">One blew a whistle and ran around the corner for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">The other one had a rifle or a gun or something, I don’t remember, and he was holding on to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I realized the import of what was happening and I began to scream and I bit the hand of this policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">He began -- pulled away his hand in pain and screamed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">My mother grabbed me and we ran and hid and we got away. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">At that time, my mother and I shared a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with another lady in a sort of a <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> which must have been all Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I don’t know whether the woman who owned this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was Jewish or not, I only remember that she -- I remember a lot about her actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">One of the things that I remember is that she kept talking about her son who was in the army and who was going to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="569">She had cookies or mondelbrut that she had baked and she had it in packages under a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabinet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">She showed us that she had baked this and she was saving it for her son, it was his favorite thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">As soon as she knew where he was, she would send it to the front, send some to the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">But if that wasn’t possible that was okay, because he would be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> soon and then she would have this for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">My mother and the lady who shared the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with us gave each other a knowing sort of look and then my mother, every night, proceeded to steal some of the cookies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">QUESTION:  Was this an Ukrainian woman?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">One day, my mother went out and she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> very, very excited, very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">At that time we were literally starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">There was nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">It was summer and we were eating, it’s a weed that grows. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">It’s kind of a jagged leaf and it has a kind of gray, silky, shiny surface. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">It grows here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and every year is a ritual, I eat some. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">It kind of tastes like spinach. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">That’s what we ate that summer, that and the stolen cookies. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Every now and then something else my mother was able to forage. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">But my mother came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day extremely excited and happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">She had made a great coup, a conquest. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">She brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> this treasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">She carefully unwrapped this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I couldn’t wait to see what it could possibly be. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">She kept on unwrapping this handkerchief. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">It was in this piece of cloth. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Finally there was this two- inch square of -- or maybe it was one inch, I don’t know -- it looked like a big domino of something white. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I’d never seen it. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I didn’t know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I said to my mother, what 1s it? </span><span class="sentence" id="596">It was such a treasure! </span><span class="sentence" id="597">She said, it’s fat, which didn’t mean anything to me but it did finally mean that she was able to fry those greens and they had a little taste rather than eating them raw or boiling them.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="606">ANSWER:  Possibly or the one after that, I don’t really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">That period is very -- it’s all very fuzzy. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I mean my memories are more anecdotal than they are historic. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">There’s no real sequence. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I guess they’re in some sort of sequence but it doesn’t really tell you much, well maybe it does. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">So my mother made me this coat and I remember this lovely spring coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">It was a very pale gray tweed and it had little nubs of color, little colors. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">The colors were all pastel, little bumps all over this fabric. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">They were beautiful, pale lavender and pink and light green and blue and just sort of a capelet, a little cape on top of the shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I remember that I couldn’t wait for it to get warm enough to wear this wonderful treasure that my mother had made. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">When I finally -- it was time to wear to it my mother sewed this very ugly yellow star on my left shoulder and my left shoulder blade. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And I protested vehemently and she simply told me not to discuss it. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">It was a fact and to ignore it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">QUESTION:  This was your first yellow star?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">QUESTION:  Then this was before you had seen that -- the embroidered picture?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Well, the yellow stars became common. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I also remember my mother coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">She had a navy coat and it had a black fur collar, a shiny -- a seal. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">It must have been a seal collar or a black Persian , or I don’t know, something, a black fur collar. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">When she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- and the coat had yellow stars on it -- when she returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from wherever she had been, the fur had been removed from her coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">She explained to our roommate that all fur had to be donated to the German army because they needed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Of course, the coat was ruined. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">So I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">One day my mother came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she had this young girl with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">She was a teenage girl and I was supposed to remember her, but I only vaguely remembered her. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Apparently this girl had been a student of my father’s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">My mother, by chance, bumped into her somewhere in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and brought this girl whose name was Rya. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">She sat me on her lap and in her no nonsense sort of way, she said to me, you must go with Rya and when I can, I will come for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">When will you come for me? </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Crusscoov.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">QUESTION:  You heard that one before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">ANSWER:  Of course, my mother never came for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">QUESTION:  Do you have any idea when this was? </span><span class="sentence" id="641">How many winters, for example, had passed since you had been wandering?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">ANSWER:  I know that this incident was at the very end of summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">It was probably the same summer which the preceding spring had brought the pretty coat and the yellow star experience and all that sort of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">QUESTION:  The same year that you had the incident with the picture, the embroidered picture?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">ANSWER:  Yes, probably although --. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I would imagine that that was very close, those events were very close to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">The events that I told you before, traveling with my father, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the bombing with the blankets over the head and all that; I think that was probably a year before. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">So that might have been, say 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">QUESTION:  Pretty good guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">QUESTION:  Did you see German soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="652">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Well, of course, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">QUESTION:  More so than before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">ANSWER:  Yes, I didn’t really see a great deal of German soldiers when I was still with my mother, although yes, some.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  Any explosions, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> , bombings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  A lot, a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I told you about listening to my mother’s knitting needles in <span class="BUILDING">bomb shelters</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> and that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">That was nothing, that was daily, sometimes twice daily. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Many times, that was --that was just ordinary. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">In fact, at one point, I was pushed down some <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , or a <span class="DLF">ladder</span> or something and my nose was broken. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">It wasn’t even known until the next day that my nose was broken because we were in the dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">It wasn’t until the light that my mother saw that I was completely bruised -- my nose had been shattered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">QUESTION:  You were someplace in the <span class="REGION">western Ukraine</span> , late summer, end of summer ’41 and your mother is Now giving you to this young woman who was also from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> originally? </span><span class="sentence" id="665">A No. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Now I have to give you a little bit of background. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">First of all, Rya was no more than a teenager at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I would say, that at the most, she was 16 or 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I would have been say five and a half, six. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">So Rya was, I don’t know, ten years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">A little background... In the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , what I know of the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , there are little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Obviously, there are big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> but the countryside of the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> was... This is another life, now I’m giving you history that I- this is where I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">There were little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> which were connected to each other by <span class="DLF">dirt roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">During the summer these <span class="DLF">roads</span> were traversed by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">horse drawn carriage</span> , not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> but <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> -- surrounding these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were the <span class="DLF">farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="676">The <span class="REGION">land</span> had been divided after the fall of the Czars, Czar, First World War, had been divided among the peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Previous to that, it was owned by the <span class="BUILDING">Church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">So that now although the people were very religious and were very loyal to the village priest and they were very generous to him; he was no longer as wealthy and flamboyant as they had been during the time of the Czars, during <span class="REGION">White Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">But because the peasants were religious, the priests lived a far better life than did the peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Now it’s the <span class="BUILDING">Greek Orthodox Church</span> , the Bible is in Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">The priests marry and have families. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">The families were the intelligentsias, if you will, of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">The children of the priests became the postmaster, the school teachers, the mayor, if there was such a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">They sort of ran the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">QUESTION:  They could read and write?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  They could read and write. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Some f them were very highly educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">The more wealthy was the priest, the better educated were his children. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">In order to be educated they were sent “abroad”’. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Abroad meant great <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in Europe like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> where this particular Rya, child of a priest in an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ukrainian village</span> would up studying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Apparently she took private lessons at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or somehow or other got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to meet my mother and became enamored of my mother and became a frequent visitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I told you earlier about the generosity of my grandmother and her warmth and so forth, and I am sure that my mother befriend this young girl from the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> in a similar sort of way, although this girl was not of peasant stock. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">But my mother liked her and they had a relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Therefore, when my mother bumped into her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and explained our plight, Rya must have asked -- I had to have been a baby, less than four -- and Rya must have played with me or possibly babysat or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So when my mother explained our plight and the possibilities of our disaster, Rya being an altruistic, kind and religious teenager said, well I’Il take her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and hide her with me, without any thought to the consequences or to the reaction of her family or the possible danger to herself, her family, the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , the future, I mean, you know, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">She simply offered and my mother jumped at the opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">So my mother sent me off with a little package of clothing wrapped around a handkerchief, my teddy bear who was now significantly smaller than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I remember walking down the <span class="DLF">front steps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I remember my mother standing on the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> saying don’t turn around. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Just go, walk through the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and don’t turn around, keep walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Remember what I told you, remember what I told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">We walked through the -- down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and through the <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I remember that the <span class="DLF">garden</span> was overgrown and unkempt and wilted and a great mass of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">It had been cultivated at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">That’s why I -- it was late summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I remember walking with Rya holding my hand and I holding on to my teddy bear and Rya with the bundle. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">We walked out and I turned once to look at my mother and she was holding a handkerchief up to her face. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">She yelled again don’t turn around, keep walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">That’s my last memory of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I don’t even remember getting to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I don’t remember arriving, I don’t remember any of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">QUESTION:  Had you remembered Rya from before? </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Or were you -- as far as you were concerned this was a stranger?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">ANSWER:  No, I might have -- I don’t know, I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I don’t remember whether I remembered then or...I was just an obedient child and I went... If my mother said she would come for me, she would come for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">If she said that I would be safe and I should go, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I trusted my mother and I knew not to argue with my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">QUESTION:  Were you wearing your yellow star?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I don’t imagine so, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I’m not sure that that yellow star was on summer clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I think it might have only been on outerwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I really don’t recall that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">QUESTION:  But Rya knew you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  Rya.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">QUESTION:  Rya.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So now we arrive in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I’ll describe the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">There was a <span class="DLF">dirt road</span> through which you got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">When you got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , there were <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , there’s one in these pictures somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">There’s a man standing in front of it -- I was looking at it before and now I can’t find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">It’s kind of log <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> with thatched roofs. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Why don’t you turn that off for a moment and I’Il look for the pictures?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  There were <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> like I pointed out to you with thatched roofs, <span class="BUILDING">log cabin</span> kind of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , but whitewashed; whitewashed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">log cabins</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Then the <span class="DLF">road</span> split like a wishbone. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">In the crook of the wishbone sat a small, white <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with steps going up. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">It had a large <span class="DLF">door</span> and two <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">When I looked at it, 1t looked like a clown face because it had a big <span class="DLF">window</span> on each side of the <span class="DLF">door</span> and the <span class="DLF">steps</span> -- it looked like a clown with his tongue hanging out. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">It had a sharp point at the top of the cross with the slash underneath. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">The <span class="DLF">road</span> went around it. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Behind the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was a small <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> with crosses, stone crosses. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">There was a legend that the cross of the priest whose family I was about to live with, that stone cross grew every year. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">The people wee so superstitious and they had revered this particular priest to such a degree that these legends about him grew. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Anyway, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> continued as the <span class="DLF">road</span> -- the two <span class="DLF">roads</span> ...
QUESTION:  Diverged.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="747">ANSWER:  Diverged, exactly behind the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="748">I would say that at the very most there were 30 to 50 <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="749">That was the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">On the left side behind our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was the most elegant <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it was a clapboard house, very different from the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> ...Further back behind our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">stream</span> and then a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="751">On the opposite side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , to my right, as I was facing the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was a <span class="DLF">road</span> that led out to the <span class="DLF">fields</span> where all of the various wheat and grain and hemp and barley and whatever all was grown was. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">That was the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="753">There was no electricity, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> , there were no telephones. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">The donation that I made to you, I wrote a little piece to go with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">The little dress we grew our own hemp. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">We spun on a spinning wheel, we spun the yarn. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">It was loomed at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I sewed it by hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Life was primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I am sure that it was no different than it had been two centuries before. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">That was the life of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="763">ANSWER:  So I’ve described the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Okay, the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I mean I could describe our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Very briefly, Pll tell you that life was centered for the most part around the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , primarily because it was the warmest <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">There was no central heating of any kind, in fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">There is usually a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and the <span class="DLF">wall</span> against which the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> 1s in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> 1s the <span class="DLF">bed wall</span> in the adjacent <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> simply because of the heat, you know, the warmth. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">There was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which must have been the back of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , the <span class="DLF">wall</span> behind where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> where we baked our bread was. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">We used to sit in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Or if not sit, we would stand with our hands behind our back leaning on that warm <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="772">We would take turns because only one <span class="NPIP">spot</span> on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> was really warm and so we would take turns. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">That was how our evenings were spent. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">We would tell stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">In fact, Rya devised a game. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">She would start a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">She would say Mirka and Vali were two beautiful children and they went on a picnic. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">When they got out to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> a wolf suddenly jumped out from behind a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and Mirka said ---, and she would point to me and I would have to pick up the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Then I would take the story to some precipice and the next person would go on with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">This is how we entertained ourselves at night and then we would all go to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">QUESTION:  Just you and Rya?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">ANSWER:  No and other members of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">QUESTION:  Were there other brothers...? </span><span class="sentence" id="784">A Yes, I'll tell you about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">That’s how our evenings were spent. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">There wasn’t much to the evening because we woke up to the roosters. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">They took off with the first light, they would crow. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Life would start at five in the morning or whatever it was and I am sure we were all in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and asleep by dark.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">QUESTION:  Candlelight?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">ANSWER:  Kerosene, we had kerosene lamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Okay, the members of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">The priest had died some years before, two, three, five, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">The wife of the priest was very highly revered in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and she was, in fact, feared. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">She was spoken of in the third person, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Enormous respect was accorded her. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">She was spoken of in the way you speak of a -- almost a god or a monarch, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Very highly respected and revered. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">People paid <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">There were obligatory visits that they had to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">They brought baskets of fruit, or whatever, to visit her. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">They would nod in our direction whether we were sitting by the <span class="DLF">window</span> or not, nod toward our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> as they walked by to pay respect, that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Now she was a very bright woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">It was decided that my new identity was going to be that she was -- she spoke fluent Polish -- she was very well educated. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">She was fluent in Polish so my identity was going to be that she was Polish and had married the Ukrainian priest but she had a sister back in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and I was that sister’s child. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">That was -- since I came from, I don’t know where, wherever they had me come from in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , my Ukrainian was not perfect, my Russian was not absolutely perfect, but that was the excuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I was brought from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of -- I was her niece, or her relative, or whatever and that was why my name was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I didn’t look exactly like them and that was my beard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="808">QUESTION:  You were given a new last name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="809">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">So I had a new last name which was a Polish last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Theirs was a Russian name, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I remember only that my name was purported to have ended in ski whereas theirs ended in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kvov</span> which son of whatever as does ski, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">In any case, so I was --well, it’s irrelevant, okay, I won’t give you all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">In any case, this woman had five children. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">The oldest was Ivan and Ivan was the son who really didn’t take too terribly well to education. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I don’t think he was ever sent abroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">He was sort of more interested in farming. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">He was very practical, he was the farmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">He was huge, he had a moustache, he never smiled, he rolled his own cigarettes, he spat into a spittoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">You know, he was more like a peasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">He was very well liked and respected and he was like one of the boys and probably the head boy, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">Then there was a middle son and he was very rebellious. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">He ultimately ran off to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and was with the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">In fact, I used to hide out by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> when the Germans came. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">At one point, I was hidden in the hayloft, haystack rather. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">He once or twice came and gave me messages which I carried back. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">But I hardly remember him because he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I don’t even remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">I remember that his mother -- I remember his mother describing him to someone, and she said, and it’s funny because it’s an expression that I’ve used many times because it described him so well, it described his nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">She said that this middle son when he has a cause or feels strongly about something would fight until he was up to his knees in blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I don’t know whether that was a Russian saying but I’ve heard myself saying that in describing such a person, a kind of tenacious stubborn person. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">The youngest son was two years older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">His name was Vali and I was -- he and I slept in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I was, I don’t know, five and a half, six; he was two years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">I can describe him perfectly. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">He was very tow headed. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">He had a cowlick in sort of in the wrong <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="838">It was just above the widow’s peak where his hairline began. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">He had a sort of a double cowlick with cowlicks going in opposite directions at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Because of that, his hair was almost shaved off. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Because had it not been, it probably wouldn’t have been able to sort of stay all in the same direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">So he has this Russian version of a crew cut. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">So those were the three sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">The two daughters were Rya, who I’ve already told you about and the older one whose name I really don’t remember and whom I didn’t get to know very well because she already worked and lived in, sort of in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="845">So she had some sort of <span class="BUILDING">office</span> type job. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">Rya was the homemaker and Ivan was the farmer who grew the whatever, the provider and the man about the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Vali was the kid and my playmate sort of, and the middle boy was the rebellious, I don’t know, 14 year old he was, who ran off and joined the partisans and became what we called a Cossack. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">So that was the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="849">Now I was not received with any degree of love or kindness. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I wasn’t sheltered or shielded or loved at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">I was tolerated, I was respected and I was sort of taken care of but never with kindness, never with love. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I was never complimented. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">If I did something very well, it was -- more than anything I had the feeling of resentment. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Furthermore, I was from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I was urbane and Vali was a peasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">He had never been to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I described the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in which I lived which had four floors. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">He couldn’t understand that there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> above a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I explained to him that it was like the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> where they dried their apple slices on a -- strung from one <span class="NPIP">end</span> to another -- and stored things. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Also like the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> where the cabbage slaw was kept and that, in fact, his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had three floors. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">But these were four floors of one above the other, <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> and, you know, <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I described one <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="863">He couldn’t conceive of such a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">He couldn’t conceive of such a thing as chocolate either. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">So that when we were finally invaded by the German army, the first time I was hidden in the haystack which I already mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">But then they went back and forth and in and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">They were, you know, driven out by the Russians and there was fighting back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">So they were there several times, 1n and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">At some point, I became very brazen and I wound up sitting on the laps of officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">They would pinch my cheeks, kiychy-koo and play with me and so forth and give me chocolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I would then take the chocolate and give it to Vali. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Until the mother found out about this and put a stop to it because it was, you know, absolutely life threatening. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Well, anyway I never really had any love. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I was incredibly lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I kept thinking about my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">One day, it just occurred to me that she’s not living and she’Il never come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Meanwhile the mother, Vali’s mother, Rya’s mother, was teaching me to read, to sew, to be a Ukrainian child, girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Taught me all the things, how to spin, how to weave, how to sew, how to mend, how to cook a little bit although it was very difficult because of the primitive style of cooking in deep ovens with iron pots. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">You know, children couldn’t physically manage that but everyone had jobs and mine was peeling the potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">In the time that I was there, in the two and a half years, I must have peeled ten truckloads of potatoes, that’s all I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I peeled potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">I read with the mother and at first she would read to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">She read me Bible stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">She would read to me and she would point to the words with her finger. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I would watch her moving finger across the page and then she would turn the page and there would be a picture that related to the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">She would continue the story and I kind of fell in love with one story. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I kept asking her to read it over and over. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">It was the story of the prodigal son. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">I don’t know why I liked that one especially but somehow... So she read it over and over and then one day in the middle of the story, she sort of looked up and she said, you read, and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And not only did I read but -- maybe because I had heard that one so many times -- I understood it and I read it and we turn the page and went on to the next story. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">At one point we turned the page and there was a picture of little girls crossing a little <span class="DLF">bridge</span> over a -- you know -- like a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">stream</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Hovering -- and there was a very sort of rickety little <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , maybe a log, whatever it was, and it looked dangerous with the rushing water underneath. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Hovering in flight with arms outstretched behind the little child was an angel with beautiful wings like a bird and a flowing gown. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I said what is that and she explained to me about angels. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">I said everybody has an angel? </span><span class="sentence" id="896">She said every child has an angel to protect it. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I said even Jewish children? </span><span class="sentence" id="898">She said yes, even Jewish children and even you. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">You have a very special angel. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">So that night I went to sleep and I woke up and I knew who my angel was. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I was absolutely certain that my own angel was the infant Jesus and that I would be protected because I had a Jewish angel. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">No harm would come to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">I knew that I would be all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">I can tell you a lot of stories about life in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I was there two Christmases and three Easters or maybe the other way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">It’s the other way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">One day, you’re not going to believe this, you’re not going to believe this... One day in the middle of the severest winter, a horse drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , which was an event. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I mean nothing came in the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">Sometimes, you know, if the German army was there, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came but we never saw anything like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> or.... In fact, once a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> came and all the children of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> gathered around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and stared at it as if it was a flying saucer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">QUESTION:  You had seen one before, hadn’t you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">ANSWER:  Well, I mean to me, it was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , I mean it was nothing, I had been in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="912">My grandfather had a <span class="DLF">yard</span> full of big shiny black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and I remember sitting on his lap and blowing the horn, it was outside the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , you know, one of those things you squeezed. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I mean <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> -- was nothing to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">I was a city child. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I remember being fascinated watching all these children staring at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> like it was something really. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">But in any case, it was a great event in the middle of winter, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> came from -- into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Also a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , you know, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> came from -- into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">Also a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , you know, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> pulled by a single horse with a bell and a guy huddled up and dressed in -- bundled with a whip. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">He came right to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and Rya came to me and she said Mirka do you remember your uncle Jacob. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">This is a note from your uncle Jacob. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">He’s waiting for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">I was put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">That morning, Vali, the little boy who was two years older than I, disappeared and hid with my teddy bear. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Finally the sled driver was anxious to leave and we could wait no longer and I had to leave without my teddy bear.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="925">QUESTION:  For the first time in your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="926">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">That teddy bear is alive and well and living in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> and I know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Because that -that artifact would never be destroyed or discarded, never.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">QUESTION:  They loved _ teddy bears?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="930">ANSWER:  I know that teddy bear is living and well somewhere in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="931">So several hours later, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> , we got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and a tall extremely handsome man with a moustache and dark hair; he looked kind of like Clark Gable or possibly..... No, no even more distinguished than that, not as romantic a figure but the one who -- what was that great war movie, Mrs. Miniver, who was the husband of Mrs. Miniver? </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Not Gregory Peck, Walter Pidgeon. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">So my uncle Jacob, looking like Walter Pidgeon, in black shiny boots, very natty, very straight like a soldier, lifted me out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and set me down. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I looked up at him, up, up, up; he was so tall. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">He said, do you remember me? </span><span class="sentence" id="936">I said, of course, you’re uncle Jacob. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">How do you remember me? </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And he carried me into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I told him the story of when the horse kicked him in the chest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="939">QUESTION:  Those were the days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="940">ANSWER:  Well, uncle Jacob and I traveled around Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">We went to a number of <span class="BUILDING">capitols</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I remember that we went to -- I think we were in four or five <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">We traveled by those same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> , looking for survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">We lived in <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> that were incredibly cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I'd like to tell you about one experience but first I’m sure you’d like to know how it was that uncle Jacob found this needle in the haystack hidden in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> when he had been in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="946">So now I'll tell you a story that you will not believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">Uncle Jacob left <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> where he had been put in charge because he was, I had told you before he was so trustworthy and efficient and good at everything, so he had been put in charge of the food supply, mainly the meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">He was the head butcher in charge of -- he never touched the meat but he was in charge of all the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">With the little bit of black marketing and finagling that he did, he was able to fill several suitcases or bundles with goods, ladies’ silk underwear... I don’t know where he got all this stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">I’m sure they were payoffs for favors or whatever but as we traveled around Europe later, after he found me, those suitcases got lighter and lighter because their contents is what kept us fed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">QUESTION:  That was your money?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="952">ANSWER:  That was our money. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">He also kept a journal. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Unfortunately, at one point, we had to cross a <span class="DLF">border</span> where I was told that I was to play the part of a deaf mute since we were going -- I didn’t speak the language of wherever we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">He was so fearful that he burned the journal and it was the history of the entire war, day by day, from the time he left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="956">So unfortunately a great treasure was -- and I watched that burn, I watched that burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">That was a daily log. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Anyway Jacob left <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and traveled until he -- traveled to many <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="959">At one point he wound up in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="960">QUESTION:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that’s near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where you had been staying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">The way the Jews — there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> schedules, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">People would -- if they wanted to go east, they went to the <span class="DLF">platform</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was heading east was going and they sat on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> for a day, for an hour, for a week, whatever, until the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came, they boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they went east. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped, they got off or they kept going or whatever and that’s how people got around. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">So there were always people sitting on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="967">They were going either east or west or wherever they were going, north, south, waiting, sitting on <span class="DLF">platforms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Well, apparently, Jacob got off the <span class="DLF">platform</span> and I have already described to you that he was extremely handsome, very nattily dressed, which was very unusual, highly unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">So this handsome guy gets off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with two bulging suitcases and the women were extremely attracted to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">He began to talk to a woman who was waiting for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which was going east -- in the opposite direction -- into, towards <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="971">Is that east?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="972">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">QUESTION:  The direction from whence he had come.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="975">ANSWER:  From whence he had come. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">So he gets off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , he’s on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> , he begins to chat with this woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">What is your name? </span><span class="sentence" id="978">That woman was the only human being who knew my whereabouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">She was the woman who had shared the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with me and my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="980">QUESTION:  Before your mother gave you to Rya?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="981">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Had her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> come first---. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">It was absolute sheer chance! </span><span class="sentence" id="984">He said Berliner, my mother had changed her name, she was no longer using her married name because she was so disillusioned with her husband, my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">So she had gone back to her name, Berliner. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">This woman said oh your name is Jacob Berliner. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">My dear friend was Berliner. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">My uncle -- I’m hearing this -- apparently fainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">Her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">She got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">He wasn’t sure what niece. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">He didn’t get all the facts. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">He knew the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , he knew a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">He thought it might be me but 1t could have been any number of his nieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">He didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">He fainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">I don’t know how long he was on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="998">Anyway, he was found passed out by someone who I think was also a priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">He was taken <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to that person’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , maybe because he looked wealthy, I don’t know whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">In any case, apparently he was sick, delirious, ill, I don’t know, whatever for a number of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">In that time, he told us later that he had a dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">In the dream, he dreamed he was back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , it was before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">He was wearing his tails and top hat because he had come from a ball or gone to the opera, or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">He was walking along the <span class="DLF">street</span> with his walking stick and as he got near the street lamp, gas lit street lamp, he heard the clippety clop of an oncoming <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">It was a very foggy night and out of the fog approached this horse drawn black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">He tried to peer <span class="NPIP">inside</span> but he couldn’t see because of the fog but it stopped right under the street lamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">A woman leaned forward and she was all dressed in white. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Here comes the lump in the throat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">It was my mother, his young sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">She said, Yacov, take care of my child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">He knew who it was and it was the next day that he sent this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> to get me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1012">QUESTION:  She was your guardian angel?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1123">QUESTION:  The little schooling you had would have been...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1124">ANSWER:  The little schooling I had was at the knee of the Ukrainian mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">A little bit of schooling in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> but only until 1t got too cold for me to walk barefoot to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because I had no shoes Then in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camp</span> to which we went in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camp</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">We were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camp</span> for, I can’t tell you how long, maybe a year or more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camp</span> , Jacob had the job of being in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">social hall</span> which meant he was the electrician, the plumber; he set up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> , he took them down, he was the stage manager and he was the emcee of all the various goings on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">Being handsome and charming and witty, he was the perfect emcee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the morning but <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was mostly the learning of Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">Because most of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camp</span> , all of them, were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">It was kind of embarrassing or shameful to admit that we were going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">So I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and studied Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">When I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I spoke Polish, Russian, Ukrainian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">I could understand Greek, a little bit of Hebrew, a little bit of German and somewhat more, I was able to understand but not speak fluently, Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">If I’m not mistaken, that’s seven languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1136">QUESTION:  Had you known any Yiddish before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1137">ANSWER:  Well, my grandparents in their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> spoke Yiddish and Polish so I heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">There was no Yiddish spoken between my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">Of course, I heard it after my experience in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> as we were displaced persons traveling from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">I left out one part of the story and I will tell it to you as briefly as I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">The one part of my story which I never really told and the reason I’m telling you now is that earlier today, I told it in front of my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">It’s the first time my children ever heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">So now I feel at liberty to tell it to the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">It’s not something of which I’m proud of but it’s a significant part of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">My father left us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">I can’t with all honesty say that he deserted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">But it sure felt that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">My father was a blue- eyed blond. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">My father was a linguist, he was fluent in German and he could pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Whereas, he promised to send for us, he didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">It could easily have been impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">It’s not something I’ll ever know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">But I resented my father and when my mother became Berliner again, changing her name back to her maiden name, I simply went along with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">I went along with my mother’s attitude about my father which wasn’t generous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">It wasn’t severe or bad either but their last months together were not affectionate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">So I felt that my father had betrayed and deserted me throughout the war and I never thought about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">D.P. camp</span> , while Jacob was working at the duties in the <span class="BUILDING">social hall</span> which was an all day and evening job, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the morning where I studied Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">Then when <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ended in the morning, I would have lunch with Jacob and then I was free in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Now Jacob told me that we were going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> across a big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> would sway back and forth and there was a good possibility that I would be seasick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">I had never been seasick but he described it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">To avoid that, it would be a wonderful idea if I acclimated myself to the swaying motion by going to the <span class="DLF">playground</span> and spending my time on the <span class="DLF">swings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">So I spent every afternoon on the <span class="DLF">swings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">Now the <span class="DLF">swings</span> faced a <span class="DLF">cyclone fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">On the opposite side of the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">bus stop</span> and in the afternoon a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> would come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">Now I sat on the <span class="DLF">swings</span> , swinging back and forth every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">Every day about an hour before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> came, or half an hour, an old woman would come and she would sit on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and she would take out of her bag, a little package of crumbs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">She would throw the crumbs to the little birds, pigeons, or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">She would turn around and she would nod to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">This happened afternoon after afternoon so finally we began to chat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Then one day she said to me, why are you spending so much time on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">swings</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">So I explained I’m going on a long voyage on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">I’m going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I know that I’m going to get seasick and I explained the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">She said, you know, I have a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">Some day, I’m going to go to my brother when my quota number comes up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">I said well if you’re going to go on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , then you will be wise to get acclimated to the swaying also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">From then on, instead of feeding the birds and sitting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> , she would come <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and she would sit on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">swings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">We would swing back and forth criss-crossing each other and chatting away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">One day as displaced persons do, we began to talk about our backgrounds.. She began to ask me questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">What is your name, who are you, where are you from? </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I told her about my life before the blitzkrieg in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , my father had been a violinist and a violin teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">She said tell me his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">I told her his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">The next day she returned and we sat on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">swings</span> and she said to me, tell me, do you have any marks on your body? </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">Anything that could identify you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">Anything that’s different from anything that anybody in the world has? </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">I have a beauty mark on my right forearm, shoulder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">When I was a little girl, my grandfather used to tease me by making believe he took the beauty mark off my right forearm until I began to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Then he’d say, don’t cry, don’t cry, I'll give it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">Then he would give it back to me on my left forearm or shoulder and I would look and there it would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">So she left and came back the next day and she said, that was a very interesting story about your grandfather but isn’t there anything else on your body, any scars, anything that’s different and unique? </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">I said well, I don’t like to talk about it but we have a family trait and I was born with it also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">We have six toes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">My uncle Jacob has six toes on one foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">When I was born, I had six toes on each foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">They were surgically removed and I have a scar on each foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">The next day the woman came and brought my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">I don’t know where he survived but I think in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Well my father insisted that I stay with him but we were going to sail two weeks hence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">Having waited for our quota number, having found the uncle in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">I mean all of these -- years of waiting and uncle Jacob said absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">They argued and uncle Jacob had the same resentment or appeared to have the same resentment towards my father that my mother had had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">I didn’t show him great warmth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1205">QUESTION:  Did you recognize him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1206">ANSWER:  Oh, of course, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">So they argued and finally uncle Jacob said to me, okay, it’s her choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">Of course I insisted on going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">Well about a year later, my father followed me and he knew where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">By the time he came a year later I had begun to -- I had not begun -- I had succeeded to a great extent in assimilating into American life, just like the chameleon I learned to be in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">I did, once again, of necessity, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ..
