<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Did you have a middle name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> on October 29, 1929 in the <span class="BUILDING">Rudolfina House</span> and it was a Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Let’s talk a little bit about your family and the background, how fa -- how far back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> it went, or other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  As far as I know, both my grandparents, my father’s parents and my mother’s parents were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and they all lived there, fairly close to us and I remember them parti -- partially from memory and partially from my dad’s pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And we were, I guess, an average, middle class, Jewish, Viennese family. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And my January 9, 2004 father was an attorney, my mother was a housewife and my grandfather was a doctor and my other grandfather had a leather business in which my father worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  And what were the names -- your parent’s names were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  My father’s name was Eric Alexander Sorter. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My mother’s name was Gisele Sorter. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My mother’s parents were Adele and Emil Koernig and my father’s parents were Emil and Hilda Sorter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  And did you have a large extended family of cousins and aunts and uncles?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Well, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">My mother was one of three, and my father had one brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Did you have any brothers or sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Thad no brothers and sisters, I was an only child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  And what kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> did you live in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  I would say it was a middle class kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which we owned and it was quite large, and in those days people had lots of servants, and we had someone who came in to do the laundry because it was before <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">washing machines</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dryer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And my mother always took care of me, but when she had to go out, there was always someone there with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The last one I remember was Umgayla.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  And was it a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> or a non-Jewish, or a mixed? </span><span class="sentence" id="27">January 9, 2004
ANSWER:  You know, I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I really don’t know because a-as people probably know, when you lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in the thir -- in the 30’s, you considered yourself Viennese before you considered yourself Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We lived across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> , and there was no separation of <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and state, and so when I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- excuse me -- we had religion in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And the Catholic kids went on one <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and the Protestant kids went on another and the Jewish kids went upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And I remember I had a teacher and her name was Mrs. Wolfe and she always told us we shouldn’t be afraid of her because her name was Wolfe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  Was she a Jewish teacher?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  I believe so. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">But we had cards, I still have one, with ma -- a picture of Moses on it and we had to get the cards punched when we went to services every Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">That was like, you know, our homework.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  How religious was your family and how affiliated Jewishly were they?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Well, we belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">You know, you -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> at that time you were taxed according to -- through -- through the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> , because the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> had to send in lists of who was a member. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">That’s why it was so easy, you know, for the Nazis, and you were taxed according to that affiliation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  And you said -- so you obviously went to a -- what we call a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">January 9, 2004
QUESTION:  And wh-what age did you start?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  I -- there was no <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> at that time and I went to a <span class="BUILDING">private kindergarten</span> and my teacher was Miss Sophie and she taught me French be -- and then, when we were going to emigrate, my mother asked her to give me English lessons, but the only English lessons she gave me were nursery rhymes. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I was very good on Humpty Dumpty, that was one of my specialties.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  German. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Viennese German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Did you know any Yiddish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Nobody in my family spoke Yiddish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Did you celebrate any Jewish holidays?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Yes, we c-celebrate, especially with my mother’s father. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We usually had Seder at my grandparents, I remember that, and I have a German Hebrew Haggadah, which I still have. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And that was about all I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Now, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> at that time, I had a Christmas tree. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">My parents, at a -- there was no, you know, there was no discussion about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Every kid I knew who was Jewish had a Christmas tree, the Christmas tree was for me and the maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It was like, that’s what you did at that time and I got th -- we didn’t have stockings or anything like that, but I got my presents under the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">That was a Viennese tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">January 9, 2004
QUESTION:  So there was no discussion of what the holiday really meant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  You mean Christmas?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  Chri-Chris -- Christian-wise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">It was just, you know, I mean, 1-1t’s contrary to here where, you know, you make a big deal out of Hanukkah because you don’t want the kids to feel inferior. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Everybody I knew got their presents at Christmas.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And what about friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Did you have non-Jewish friends also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Most of my friends were -- I think all my friends were Jewish, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I-I -- I still have a very good friend who lives in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> and she and I went to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> together and we’ve kept up all these years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Did you observe Shabbat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  And wh-what -- Kashrut?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  No. [</span><span class="sentence" id="76">indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Did you feel Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  Not particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Not particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I mean, I -- there was no problem about, you know, kids going to different <span class="NPIP">places</span> for their religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I mean, I never felt that I was better, worse, inferior or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">It was just a fact, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I wa -- I January 9, 2004 knew I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">You have to remember, I was eight years old when I left, so from the time I was six to the time I was eight, that -- those were the only years that I wa -- I was in -- 1-in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">By the way, I-I was a very protected child, I never went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">school buses</span> , my mother walked me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">She walked me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> t -- for lunch, she walked me back from lunch, she picked me up again, a-and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So --
QUESTION:  So even though you were -- obviously you were quite young when you left, you- you were not that independent as a very young child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Not at all, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">As a matter of fact there was a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> I remember, very close to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I was never allowed to go there by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I -- it was just -- you know, it never came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And then when Hitler marched into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in - | think it was March third, ’38, my mother took me out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Now, I don’t know whether she had to take me out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , whether she wanted to protect me to -- you know, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And that’s when I started those English lessons with Humpty Dumpty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So up -- up to the time of the anschluss you were leading a normal life --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  -- and a child’s life. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">January 9, 2004
ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  We'll get to that point in a minute.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  Did you have -- and again, you were very young, of course --
ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  -- did you have any other interests of hobbies or playing, or did you have any favorite toys? </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Anything like that that you can describe, as a young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  I had a beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">doll carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It was gray and it had <span class="DLF">windows</span> and it had a <span class="DLF">roof</span> that rolled -- you could roll up and it had blue curtains on the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and when we were here for a few years, my dad and I always used to take walks, and one day we passed the -- we lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on <span class="DLF">Riverside Drive</span> , and I passed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garbage bin</span> and there was my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">My mother did not ask me if she could throw it out, she just did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And it -- Pll never forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It was like the worst shock of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  What was her rationale for throwing it out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Well, at -- at that time my grandmother and my aunt and my cousin, we were all living in one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And I guess she figured, you know, I was old enough not to need the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">doll carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But again, I had -- my granddaughter Lauren had interviewed me and I explained to her how -- you know, she asked me if I was January 9, 2004 scared when I had to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and I tried to explain to her -- she’s 15 now- how in those days, in 1938, if you were a child in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , or at least in my family, if your parents said, we’re going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , which my mother did, I never questioned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was just, you know, that’s what you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">You didn’t say, oh I’m sorry I’m not going, or I’m sorry, I’m staying with a friend or -- or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It was just a very different time. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And my mother always did say, cause sh -- I think she wanted to paint it as black as possible, that we were going to live ina <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And I was such a naive kid that when we got here and we didn’t live in a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , I said, how come we’re not living in a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">But you have to remember, I was eight years old, it was 1938, that’s the way it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  My parents were actually really wonderful in retrospect, because I -- I really never was scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I know we didn’t have a lot of money, in retrospect, but I never had the feeling that A, I was going to starve, B, I was poor, C, I wouldn’t have enough clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I never had that feeling, so they -- they must have just been very positive people to convey that message to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  How old were -- were you when you first heard of man named Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Well, I remember very clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">It was the President Schuschnigg, was his name, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , when he abdicated, and I remember everybody sitting in our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> January 9, 2004 and my mother crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So it must have been very shortly, you know, before the anschluss. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So I was -- I was eight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And what are your memories of the anschluss?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Well, my mother took me out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">She didn’t really explain it too much, but I think all my -- my three best friends also, you know, couldn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But, I mean, they didn't tell us that anything horrible was going to happen to us if we continued to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Again, it was this naivete, you know, of your mother says you’re not going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you’re going to have English lessons cause you’re going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">You know, that’s how it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  So you and your friends, did you talk about that --
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  -- at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I think we must have talked about, you know, who was leaving first and -- and -- and those kind of things, but I -- I really don’t remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And so then your -- your mother started to prepare and your father started to prepare to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Right, well --
QUESTION:  What -- do you know what they did? </span><span class="sentence" id="142">January 9, 2004
ANSWER:  -- a very dramatic thing happened with my dad, tha -- ma -- as I said, my dad was an attorney, but he worked for my grandfather and he was like -- I don’t know how you called it in -- in German, but he was the attorney at the -- at the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , because my grandfather’s <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">leather factory</span> was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And --

<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  And not many people know this, but before the Nazis started to wear swastikas, they wore blue carnations. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And the accountant in my dad’s <span class="BUILDING">office</span> wore a blue carnation. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And after the anschluss he had a gun and went into my grandfather’s <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and said, this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> is mine now. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">He didn’t shoot my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But my father, who was, you know, young, saw the writing on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And the people who gave us our affidavit were customers of his in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , who are not Jewish and saved our lives.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  And how did they get contacted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  I guess my father cabled them or called them or -- you know, somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Mr. Simon used to come to purchase leather, you know, from my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So that’s how my father knew him, but only very slightly.</span></p>

ANSWER:  No, no, but I know that Frank’s tol -- Frank told me then that I was the first girl from Europe that he had ever dated, because I guess in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dayton</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> there weren’t that many refugee kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">QUESTION:  Did you feel a connection because of that refugee status that you both had?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="589">ANSWER:  English. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">We always spoke English until our kids were born and then one day we decided maybe they should learn a little German. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And Frank and I discovered that we spoke an entirely different language. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">That the German they speak in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> is not the German that he spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And then, of course, the kids learned all those phrases about going to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and, you know, all the things that kids at that time shouldn’t know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="599">ANSWER:  Well, my husband always said that it hadn't been for Hitler, A, we wouldn’t have met and B, that our lives are much richer living here.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="601">ANSWER:  Well, I don’t know what our lives would have been like. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">I mean, we -- the chances of Frank and I meeting were nil. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">You know, he lived in <span class="REGION">Upper Silesia</span> , I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Unless his family took a trip, I mean th -- I -- th-there was -- there- probably we -- we just wouldn’t have met and we probably, you know, would have married different people and had different interests and children and so on.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="608">QUESTION:  How did you present your family history an-and -- and what happened to the Jews in Europe to your children? </span><span class="sentence" id="609">January 9, 2004
ANSWER:  Well, they knew that their father and I had been born in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I mean they stu- they studied. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">We were very active at Temple Beth-El in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Great Neck</span> and they -- they studied what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And you know, they’d ask us questions an-and -- and we'd answer it. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And -- oh, I don’t know what year it was, but when I was teaching in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Great Neck</span> at the John F.

<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">So your children, at a young age -- relatively young age were aware of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">It’s like -- you know, y-you -- I-I don’t know some -- we -- we’re a very open kind of family and you know, it -- it was always part of their past. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I mean, they- they always knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">They -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I mean, both my husband and my parents and my in-laws had accents, so I think this sort of, you know, brou -- brought about questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And my son, unfortunately, when he was in <span class="BUILDING">med school</span> , got leukemia and my s -- husband was the bone marrow donor, twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And the big joke always was, was Jerry going to get an accent, or my curly hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">He didn’t get the accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">He got my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> -- curly hair the first time, he didn’t get it the second time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  I don’t feel a -- I know that I’m probably a little different, because people have said to me -- it -- 1t’s not so much that I -- I feel different, but w-we’ve traveled a lot and when I go to Europe, I really feel that people in Europe look more like me than people here. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I don’t know why that is, but it -- it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I -- I -- I have that feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And -- but otherwise -- once in awhile I’ Il joke around with -- with old friends of January 9, 2004 mine and they’Il use a -- a word that I’m not familiar with and I'll say, hey, you know, English is my second language and they -- everybody laughs, you know, cause I’ve been here for such a long time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">QUESTION:  Have you been back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">ANSWER:  Yes, we went back eight years ago because my husband wanted to see where I lived and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And he got food poisoning and I really didn’t want to go in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">QUESTION:  Why not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">ANSWER:  Because I live 1n the present and the future and to me the past is the past, it’s -- it’s gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">It’s -- that’s the way it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I mean, I -- I know people who live here in <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> who dwell on their past. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">They’re sometimes -- they are older than I am and maybe they had some horrible experiences, because I have a -- a step-cousin who was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and she and J are pretty close, she lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And we ve talked about it, that some people who had very bad experiences, as she did, that she was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , either talk about it all the time, or never talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And she’s one of those people that never talks about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">So, people are different. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I mean, you can’t say that all Viennese kids who at the age of eight came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , you know, think one way or -- or -- or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">But I -- I mean, I could pass for Yankee Doodle Dandy any time. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I am proud to be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I am thrilled every January 9, 2004 time we come back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you know, from -- from a trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Cause I am thoroughly American, except for those eight years when -- when I -- when I lived in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">But the interesting thing is, since my husband and I were recently in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and the kids saw where he was born and where he grew up, my daughter Nancy suggested, and we took her up on it, and two of our granddaughters are going to be Bat Mitzvahed this year, we’re going to take them and their older sister to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and show them where I grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">This was not my idea, this was my daughter’s idea, but wa -- I’m going to do it, I want to show them, you know, th -- where I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> and -- and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">We’re going to take them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to see, you know, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish district</span> that they have studied about. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And -- but I have no -- no real, you know, connection to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> except that I was born there.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">QUESTION:  -- and if so, what were your responses?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">ANSWER:  Well, we -- we -- we saw where I lived and the only thing that had changed was the <span class="DLF">front door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And as I said there, my husband got terrible, terrible food poisoning January 9, 2004 and I couldn’t wait to get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">He was really sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And I -- I think [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  Y-You couldn’t -- you couldn’t wait to get out of there because he was sick or because it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and you -- and your [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  It was a combination -- 1t was a combination, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And I remember feeling at a time when -- I don’t know how many years I was here or how many years I had spoken English, that I really didn't want to speak German and I didn't want to read any German books because I was -- inside myself I was afraid that I would forget my English. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">It was -- I -- I don’t remember how old I was, but I remember that feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And I -- and I didn’t want to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">QUESTION:  So English was comforting to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">It -- I mean it -- this -- I-I -- you know, I’m 74 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">This happened a long time ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="675">QUESTION:  Are there any sights today or sounds today that trigger your childhood in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">My father was a very good dancer, and he loved to waltz and he t-taught me how to waltz at a very young age. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I taught my husband how to waltz, and very often, you know, when we hear a waltz, you know, I get all mushy about my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I was very close to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">But other than that, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">January 9, 2004

<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  -- smells or anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">ANSWER:  Well, as I said, my mother was a very good cook and even though she went to <span class="BUILDING">junior college</span> , she also went to <span class="BUILDING">cooking school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And she -- you know, an- name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Zacher torte, the Linzer torte, the -- whatever, you know she could make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">But I never learned how to bake any of those things because my family was very equally divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">My father ha -- you know, had the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I was the scholar and my mother took care of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And -- so my kids are better cooks than I am because I never went into cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">End of Tape One, Side B January 9, 2004 Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with Marianne Liebermann. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">This is tape number two, side A. And let’s talk now a little bit about your teaching experience, when you started and what you taught and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  Well, I taught in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Great Neck</span> , New York for 27 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I was at first a part-time teacher and I taught in several <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , and eventually taught at the John F. Kennedy school. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">It was an <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , and I taught middle and <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ESL in the summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  Which is English to speakers of other languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Well, actually in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> it’s called teachers of English as -- to speakers of other languages, so it’s called TESL rather than ESOL as it is called here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">QUESTION:  And you obviously had children from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> who came here and you having that experience yourself as a young child, did you feel a connection to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">ANSWER:  [indecipherable|
QUESTION:  And could you understand what they were going through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  Well, I did, except their problems are very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">A lot of my students were from <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> , who came after the Shah, and they had -- they were totally different January 9, 2004 socio-economic background than the refugee children who came in 1938 from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And their problems were -- were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">It was not only the language, but a lot of their mothers had really not been their caretakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">There were a lot of servants who really brought up these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And when the mothers were faced with bringing up the children, there were a lot of problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Some of the children didn’t change their clothes day after day after day, they slept in their clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">They had a lot of trouble getting used to the food here that -- that -- it was very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Like school lunches, you know, were a big problem for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">But all in all, children are children and the younger you are when you learn a second language, the easier it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">And my job was to take the children from their <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> in small groups and teach them, rather than have a whole class of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And as I said, I had children from <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , from <span class="REGION">South American</span> , from <span class="REGION">Central America</span> , from Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">My first two ESL students when I started teaching, were the sons of the CEO of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lufthansa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And I had to swallow just a couple of times, but they were two of my best students and they did very well in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">QUESTION:  Did you speak in German to them and --
ANSWER:  No, we were not really -- oh, I wouldn’t say -- allowed is -- is too strong a word, but we were encouraged not to speak anyone’s native language because our groups were mixed, and so it wouldn’t be fair that, you know, if I speak Spanish, I spoke to January 9, 2004 the Hispanic kids, and you know, the Iranian, I don’t speak Iranian or Japanese. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">So the goal of an ESL teacher is to have the children think in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And that’s what we tried to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">QUESTION:  So you said you did not tell them about your background and having to -- to learn a new language yourself at a young age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">ANSWER:  Sometimes I did, as I got more into the program and as I had the older children. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">You know, the fifth graders were the oldest ones, but the young ones, I certainly didn’t tell them, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And it was very helpful when computers came into the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> because some children really had difficulty learning. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">They had difficulty learning anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And some children came from <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> where there was very little education for them, and we had to teach them, you know, how to tell time and tie their shoes and -- and -- you know, very -- very basic things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">QUESTION:  Di-Did you feel any kind of connection to these children, having to have left their country of birth and coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Kind of a deep seated connection, in that sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">ANSWER:  I did, but we had a very, shall we say strict supervisor who advised us in no uncertain terms that our job was not to be social workers, but to teach them English. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And so ex -- we had a lot of after school things. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">We had parties for the children and their parents and we had different kinds of foods, and -- and you know, we’d have January 9, 2004 like an Iranian lunch, where their parents could participate, or a Japanese sushi lunch, or you know, things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">But there were social workers attached to the program, and that was really more their job than mine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">QUESTION:  Let’s now talk a little bit about the religious aspect of your experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Did having to leave because you were Jewish, when you were a young child, did that enter into your thoughts and were you angry that these things -- you were having to leave because you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">ANSWER:  No, because in 1938 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , if you were Jewish, if you were part of a Jewish family, you really felt that you were Austrian before you were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And my parents were not particularly religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And it wasn’t until many years later that I realized, if I hadn’t been Jewish, would my life be very different? </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Would I have not left, a-and so on and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">QUESTION:  So as you matured and you raised children, did you become more religiously affiliated than you were as a child?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="819">ANSWER:  Well, we went back to my husband’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , which originally was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but after the second World War was given to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and the name, in German it’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> and it was changed to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gliwice</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and it was under the Russian influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And through the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , this forum found out about the fact that Frank was born in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and contacted us, and they erected a memorial to the Jews that had lived in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And it was a very, very moving January 9, 2004 experience for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">We also went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and I really wanted to be very unhappy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and I really wasn’t, because I could understand everything, and we stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">Hilton</span> , which is like staying in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> 1-in -- in a -- another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And two of my children had been to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> 20 years ago when the <span class="DLF">wall</span> was up, and they could not believe the change in <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">It -- it was just mind boggling to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> is such a modern <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and so many new <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and a lot of hustle and bustle. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And in Frank’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> also, there’d been a big change over the eight years. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">As I said, 1t had been under Russian influence, and now it seems to be, you know, a -- a -- a great <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live now. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">The people that live there were all forced to leave where they lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> and settle in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And they’ve made the best of it, and unfortunately there’s a lot of pollution there. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">There had been a <span class="DLF">coal mine</span> there, which it was closed, but there’d also been industry and all the waste had been dumped into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And so there is a great deal of pollution, and also they still use coal to heat their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="832">So at night there’s like a smog, it makes your eyes itch. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And my son, being a doctor, wanted to find out the statistics about lung cancer there, but we -- you know, we -- we weren’t able to -- to find that out. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And also, Frank wanted to s-show our children the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we lived because the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is still standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">They changed the name of the <span class="DLF">street</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> number, but the people at the forum, Andre, said that the people were afraid January 9, 2004 to show Frank the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because a lot of the Germans who had lived there are now trying to reclaim those <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And so the people somehow connected that with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">So we couldn’t see the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , but we saw the outside of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and Frank showed us where he learned how to ride his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and where he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And the memorial that they erected was a beautiful -- they had commissioned a Polish sculptor to make this memorial. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">It’s a broken Torah wi -- and with an eternal flame in it, and they weren't able -- the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> had been destroyed on Kristallnacht and so the <span class="REGION">land</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was was transferred to a Jewish group, but the group is about a hundred miles away from there, and they’re in dire straights and they were in the process of selling the <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">So they had to get the permission from the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> next door and that’s a <span class="BUILDING">cooperative building</span> and they did get the permission of all the people who lived in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and so the memorial is attached to that -- the <span class="DLF">wall</span> of that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And my son-in-law -- one of my son-in-laws passed by there after they had the ceremony, and there was a mother and a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And I don’t know whether they’re speaking German or -- somehow he understood what they said. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And I don’t know what the mother said to the little girl, but the little girl said, what’s a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Which sort of gave us the chills, you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">January 9, 2004
ANSWER:  And we just hope that nobody will destroy this <span class="DLF">memorial</span> , or you know, put graffiti on it or -- or so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">But it was a very moving trip.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">QUESTION:  Do you or Frank have any desire to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="849">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">We -- my husband has a distant cousin, a painter named Max Liebermann. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And they ha -- are in the -- that -- that painter’s <span class="BUILDING">summer house</span> is just outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wannsee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And they’re in the process of transferring his pictures, which are now in one of the <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and they’re in the midst of fundraising because it’s very expensive to make a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> safe and climately controlled for, you know, works -- works of art. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And possibly some of my kids -- they’re supposed to open it in 2005, s -- possibly some of my kids might go back to there. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">But there’s no reason, you know, for us to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">QUESTION:  When did your parents pass away?</span></p>
