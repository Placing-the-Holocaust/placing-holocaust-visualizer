<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Good afternoon, Dr. Friedman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Good afternoon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  I'd like to start by having you tell us just basic information about when and where you were born and take us rather quickly, if you would, to where you found yourself in the spring of 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Well, that covers quite a bit of <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joseph</span> , <span class="REGION">Missouri</span> , on March the tenth in 1920 and I was the fourth of five children and eventually my father and mother took in a cousin who was orphaned. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">So there were three boys and three girls in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> locally in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joseph</span> , <span class="REGION">Missouri</span> , and of course grew up during the Depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">That covered quite a long era. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We all worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">It was the usual paper route, selling magazines, eventually working in the <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span> and working my way through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as much as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Fortunately, we had a <span class="BUILDING">junior college</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joseph</span> and I was able to go there for my first two years and get an Associate Arts degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But after that, <span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> out of money, so I was in search of jobs that would pay more. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">With that in mind, I went out to <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> , where I had an older brother and his family, and I worked in an <span class="DLF">amusement park</span> in <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> — <span class="DLF">Lakeside Amusement Park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">It was a very good job for the summer because a lot of college kids worked there as they did in ranches, dude ranches, in <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So it was very pleasant work but by the end of the summer I still didn’t have enough money to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So I went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> — I was homesick and my folks wanted me to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I went back around Thanksgiving of 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And made enough money to enter my first year of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> — of <span class="BUILDING">podiatry school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I’m almost afraid to go down that <span class="DLF">alley</span> because it was my first profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I went there because Dad wanted me to be a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I didn’t want to be a doctor but this was the next best thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">In fact, it was difficult at that time, even to get into <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">There were Jewish quotas. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">But I did go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and I talked to the registrar and when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> during the summer of ’39, to make a decision as to what I wanted to do, I decided to go to <span class="BUILDING">podiatry school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Well, that was in the fall of ’41, and we know what happened on December the seventh. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">During the Christmas holidays, although they asked us to remain in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as much as we could, everybody was gung ho. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">We wanted to get into the army and fight the Japanese because of this atrocity that they had inflicted upon us at Pearl Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Well, I tried to get into the Navy but, at that time, they were very strict and I couldn’t get in on account of my eyes, plus the fact that they did encourage us to stay in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> — at least to finish that year, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but during the week of finals, I got the orders to come report to my selective draft board and fill a quota and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and went into the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I went into basic training to , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , with the 95" Infantry Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I had had ROTC in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">ROTC was very good because we were able to wear uniforms and it would save on our clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Although they tell you never to volunteer for anything in the Army, when they asked if anyone had had any close order drill, my hand went up and I was immediately put in charge of a platoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">At the end of the first month, fortunately, I made PFC. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">The second month, I made buck sergeant, I’m sorry, corporal, then buck sergeant, that’s three stripes, then staff sergeant. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Then I was ready to go to OCS. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I wanted to get out of there as soon as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I had a first sergeant, was regular army, very anti-semitic, and when I put in my papers for OCS, he didn’t send them into <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , so I didn’t get to go.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  Did you ever talk to him about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, and the reason he didn’t put the papers in, although he’d called me, in all the promotions that I got, I found out that he kept saying, “I don’t want a kike (ph) on my staff’. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">The other officers would override him and I was promoted from time to time, through the ranks. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">The reason he didn’t send me to OCS was he was going out to the 97" Infantry Division and he wanted me to go along with him, which was quite a strange thing, until you think of the fact that I did all his work. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And also, one of the officers in my company said that I was going through too fast and that OCS 1s very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">They were flunking out at least half of them and it would do me good to have a little more training, a little more of a sense of army, and what’s expected of me, and the extra six months or so that I’d have to spend would be to my advantage. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And it was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I did go to OCS and it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I think around 520 of us matriculated and there were maybe 200, 280 or 85 that finally graduated and got their bars. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Then we were sent to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I finally ended up at a <span class="BUILDING">headquarters company</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Blanding</span> , Florida, doing various jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And then went overseas.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  When did you go overseas?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Went overseas during the winter of ‘42-43. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We were stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Preston</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lancashire</span> , and we crossed the <span class="DLF">channel</span> on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Polish ship</span> called the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Sobiesky</span> (ph) and when we got midway through the <span class="DLF">channel</span> , there was a lot of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarine</span> and anti-aircraft activity by the Germans, so we had to back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I later read, after the war, that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> that left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Southampton</span> the same time we did was torpedoed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  When was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  It was. .. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">the dates are going to be a little difficult for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  The general time of year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  Oh, it was during Christmas, it was during Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">It was the same night that Glenn Miller disappeared over the <span class="DLF">channel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Which later came into a lot of things that I did after the war, or a lot of things that I thought about as being — if something took off, took of paramount importance to me, I would think of the time that I crossed the <span class="DLF">channel</span> , and how lucky that I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">When they said that, “you get on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , or you get on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , how many are in your complement”, I said, “Six officers and 96 men’. “</span><span class="sentence" id="63">Okay, you get on this one, you get on that one.” </span><span class="sentence" id="64">We were lucky enough to get on the Sobiesky (ph) that turned back. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">The other one was torpedoed, with a loss of about 90% of the personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I didn’t know this until after the war ended, when they were printing these statistics. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">At any rate, we landed. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We had to go over the side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> with a <span class="DLF">rope ladder</span> and landed in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">landing craft</span> and went into LeHarve(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Now this was after the invasion, and although we weren’t being shot at, it was still very difficult and very cold wading through the water until we get onto <span class="REGION">dry land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Once, and I’m going very fast because there’s quite a bit to cover, once we got into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , we started moving very rapidly. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">In fact, I know there were a lot of articles written about Patton streaking across <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> , across the Raymoggan (ph) bridge head, which we crossed, and into Tree Air (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Then we went to, we were in the battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baston</span> , we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Luxembourg</span> , and then into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  You came into about the tail end of the winter, fighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  From the beginning of winter, of ’44, 45.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  And the Battle of the Bulge was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  In winter of *45.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  "44,45.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  And then you were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baston</span> in February?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Around that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I once read where someone was telling an account of, 1t might not have been his war stories, it was something and what stuck in my mind was, he said “My memory has a lot of holes in it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So I’m going to paraphrase what he said, or copy what he said, and tell you that my memory, after 50 years of not going back to all this, until I was given an opportunity to give this oral history, my memory is going to have a lot of holes in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So there will be a time period that will have quite a spread. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Now with the Third Army, i 1 hope -- it would have been nice if it all happened that quickly to bring me to this point, but I know that this is the major thrust of the interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  We’re in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  We’re in April. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Our troops uncovered the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ordruff</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ordruff</span> (ph) was one of the satellite camps at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bookenblow</span> (ph) near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gotha</span> (ph) and you can’t get the full measure or the full thrust of what happens to you when you walk into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like this and see bodies, emaciated bodies, stacked one on top of the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  Back up a little bit for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">When you got the orders to go in and you were, how did you approach, what did the <span class="REGION">area</span> look like, what time of day was it, can you remember those things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Do you have that whole memory?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Vividly, vividly, it was daylight. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Those who were left, there were still bodies burning in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> , and we could still smell it. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">In fact, after the war was over when my mother would fix a chicken and try to burn off the little feathers that were left, I had to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I couldn’t smell that odor, that odor that gets into your nostrils, and never leaves. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I’ve never bought a pair of striped pajamas in my life, because that’s what they were wearing — these striped pajamas, and I know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I kept salivating. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">You know there’s, before you vomit, something happens to the salivary glands and it’s kind of a, well if you’ve ever done it, if you’ve ever had it, you know that it just, before you give it all up, there’s, you know that you're going to throw up. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And that’s rather indelicate, but this is what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Some of the dead were in very grotesque positions, leaning against a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> with their legs covered, and dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Just all sorts of, maybe some in fetal positions, lying in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Those who were still alive, in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , if you could call it a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , they were sort of lean-tos with straw, were so weak that if the one next to him was dead, he didn’t have the strength to push him off so that he could at least have maybe the small luxury of being able to turn around on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pallet</span> that had been his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We did whatever we could — we did in the way of food, whatever we could give them, whatever help we could give them, but we were still moving on. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I was still with the combat troop. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Actually, I had a litter bearer platoon, and my men were the ones who saw the first casualties, the first <span class="DLF">line</span> of casualties, and would carry them back to the <span class="BUILDING">evac hospitals</span> that were in the rear of the <span class="DLF">combat line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We did whatever we could to make them comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I heard that, after we left, there was such pandemonium, and I think that this continued until the end of the war, there was never, nothing ever ran smoothly, it seems. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">As much as we tried, there was always some trouble brewing somewhere and something to be taken care of, that needed immediate attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But I understand that the Burgermeister (ph) of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ordruff</span> (ph) was murdered by the inmates who were left and his body was dismembered and he was strung up on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">civic center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I think this is true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  You didn’t see it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  I didn’t see it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  But you have reason to believe...
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Could you see, when you first came in, some of the people who were still alive were able to walk around and talk with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  And did you talk with people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  Briefly, briefly. “</span><span class="sentence" id="121">Cause we’d both cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">There wasn’t too much, we’d start a conversation and they would love us and kiss us and we would hug them and whatever we had we would give them. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Then there was the language barrier. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Some spoke Russian, some spoke Polish, some Ukrainian, Lithuanian, Estonians, Latvian. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">They came from the <span class="REGION">Balkan countries</span> as well, <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">There was a whole cacophony of voices and languages but we knew one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They all had one thing in common — that they were free. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And I think, I think, wanted to get revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I probably would have behaved in the same way, to avenge six years, some of them, of torture, of having their families taken away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And murdered in such a manner, in such a diabolical manner, that we’ve all learned about since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I didn’t know all this at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I was aware...
QUESTION:  What did you know then? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Did you why these people were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Did you know who they were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  Right away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Well, I knew, I knew, I knew that they were slave laborers. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I knew that the majority of them were Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Do you know how you knew that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  Well, in my fractured Yiddish, and they told me, and I was able to understand a little bit of German. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But I just sensed that most of them were, because by then, what had been written in the Stars and Stripes, which was the army newspaper in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , or in Europe, we started hearing about these atrocities. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">But I didn’t have any visual evidence of it until I went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I didn’t know how they got there, well, I knew how they got there, they were forced there, but I didn’t know until later on when I read how they were put in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> , and put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> and the methodical way that they were loaded into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> with the elderly going in first, pushed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And then the younger ones and then the younger children and then perhaps, from six on down, they were just picked up by their legs and thrown into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> to land on top of whoever was there and then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> was sealed. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">If they had to defecate, or urinate, they had to do it in place, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> came into play, when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> that they used to gas — you know they would use <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> and they would hook a pipe onto the exhaust and put the pipe into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> and by the time they got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I didn’t know all this until much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">When I saw them, well, they were prisoners who hadn’t been fed who worked for the German war machine and given, not even, minimal rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Not even just something to keep them going so they could keep the war machine going, and when they couldn’t any longer do that, it was off to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">That was all I knew then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  And you saw mostly men?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Did you see women?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I don’t recall seeing any women then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  And did you spend some time — how big was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and what did you see there and what did you piece together from seeing what was at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Did you see what work they were doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Did you know that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">By then, by the time we got there, the guards had disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">They tried to kill as many as they could before they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">A lot of what went on there, we were told as we went on, as we left, and talked to each other about what had been happening there, and were given all sorts of lectures, again, on what had been happening in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I didn’t see firsthand where they worked — they weren’t working anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">They sort of spread out over the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> because, as we progressed, as the army progressed, we would see them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Walking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Walking — in the striped pajamas, foraging for food, perhaps killing justifiably, we thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  How long did you stay at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ordruff</span> ph)?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Perhaps the larger part of two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Maybe a day and then left on the second day. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">But during that time, during that time, something must have started germinating in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I couldn’t help but think, of course, there but for the grace of God, go I. I and my antecedents were all from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and I could very well have been one of the inmates of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , had I lived in that surrounding, in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">The entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , I later learned, the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that my parents and grandparents lived in and aunts and uncles whom I’d never met and cousins — they were entirely wiped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I later learned that they were all herded into a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> was set on fire and as they tried to escape, they were machine-gunned. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">This 1s in 1939 when the Germans went into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I didn’t know that that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I just know that we stopped getting letters from my grandparents in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">We stopped getting mushrooms. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">They used to send mother — my grandmother used to send her dried mushrooms and she made delicious mushroom and barley soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">That all stopped of course.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  You knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I wanted to go into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I wanted to take a bicycle tour through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I had talked to a friend who had been there and he said, “Don’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It’s not the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So we knew as early, actually, as 1933, the things that were happening, the laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I didn’t pay that much attention to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I was 13 years old then and the prom was much more important at the time, I guess.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="215">ANSWER:  Not a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Just enough to keep them alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">It became quite a hot potato after a while, on what to do with these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I do know, and it might have been, it might be a rumor, but I was told that our Air Force, who did almost pinpoint bombing, eventually, was told not to bomb any of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German military camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Or any of the IG Farban (ph) <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Now the IG Farban was this tremendous cartel that had quite a bit of American money involved in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">The <span class="BUILDING">army barracks</span> , we knew that we were going to have to use them for the displaced persons, until they could be repatriated. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Now it wasn’t that difficult to send the western Europeans back, who’d been slave laborers, send them back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> — although <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> was Allied Germany for a while — they were also working in the war effort and had to be sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">But we couldn’t do anything with this tremendous, tremendous horde of eastern Europeans until we made contact with the Russians and that took “til the end of the war, and then some. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And then problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  Is there anything else about that day and a half in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ordruff</span> that you remember, that you want to relay? </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Anything about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> itself, the local people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Did you have any opportunity to interact with the local people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  I didn’t speak with any of them, but they all stood around as though. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  They came — was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> right in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">On the edge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , on the edge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They acted as though, as they were surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">But I honestly believe that no matter where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were, the people knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They knew! </span><span class="sentence" id="235">They smelled it! </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They smelled the ovens. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">They smelled the smoke that came out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">They didn’t think they were baking bread there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">QUESTION:  And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself was close enough to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  . . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">that was no doubt in your mind that people must have smelled and seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  Now, they might not have seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They might not have been all that aware of how, how really despicable the conditions were — how horrible they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But I’m sure that they knew what was going on, and didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Jews! </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Who cared? </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Hasn’t that always been the history?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  I can’t say that I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I really didn’t know enough then, and didn’t feel enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But what I did feel, and I guess that’s what later led me, I’m taking all this in, probably, led me to volunteer to stay over after the war ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Or to get into the work of repatriating the displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I thought if I could, that whatever I could do, that I would try. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">In fact, it became a problem to the United States Army before the war ended, because when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that were overrun, eventually all of them, knew that they would get better treatment from the United States Army, and, as we progressed, I would see hundreds, literally hundreds, thousands even, Russians walking, displaced persons walking along the <span class="DLF">street</span> , along the <span class="DLF">highway</span> that we were driving on to get from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">They had to be put in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , otherwise we couldn’t feed them, we couldn’t clothe them, we couldn’t control them.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  I am, actually my platoon was broken up shortly after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And, ‘cause the war was winding down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  You didn’t, you weren’t, that function wasn’t necessary anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I still had control of them but they were assigned to various combat troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">At times we were with, I forget the names of the various corps, the 12" Corps, the 22" the 15", and from time to time, I would see them and sort of oversee them and see that they got their rations and see that they got their pay and see that they got their mail. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">But other than that, other than that, I, the work really for me sort of died down a bit, until, until my commanding officer asked me if I thought I would like to get involved in working with the displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And it wasn’t all altruistic, at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I thought if I would get involved with that, when the war ended I wouldn’t be sent to the Pacific. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I’m being honest 1n saying that that was a factor, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">But the overriding factor, I believe, was something inside me that just wanted to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">You know, I’m beginning to think, and as I hear myself and as we go on with this oral history, I’m going, you’re going to hear I a lot, I guess.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="278">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">It’s your story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  Pronouns tend to get all knocked all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">But I know of no other way I can tell you this. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">But I really, honestly and truly, wanted to do what I could to help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">QUESTION:  Where were you — do you remember hearing that the war was over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">ANSWER:  I didn’t know the war was over until three days after it was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And it’s in my notes here. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We were near a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and there were two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> that landed near us. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">A German officer and a blonde came out of one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> with a case of champagne. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And he’s the one who told us, the group that I was with, that the war had ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I think it was a, I think the war ended, what May the 52 This was about May the 8". </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I wrote <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I told them that I found out that the war had ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Now other things happened along the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I received a promotion from second — I was a second lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And I received a promotion from second lieutenant to first lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Now I can along on this vein for awhile, if you wish...

<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  But it is germane to what has happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I received a promotion, first lieutenant, and while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph), one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , we were constantly being inspected. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">There was a group of officers that came in from Third Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">No one wanted the responsibility of running one of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , because by this time, there were all sorts of letters written to the paper, and all sorts of surveys being made on how the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were run and how the Jews were being treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Governor Lame (ph) and I recall reading in the Stars and Stripes that the Jews were being treated worse by the American army and by Unrah, (ph) and so on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , than they were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Well, this wasn’t true, entirely, but there was some truth in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">They didn’t know whether to put the Jews in with all the other DPs, or, because the Jews were stateless, they were homeless then. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">They couldn’t go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> had already been taken over by the Poles, the Russians, or whatever and they were happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">They were happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I’m getting ahead of myself.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="373">ANSWER:  Civilian. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And army. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">We had, now understand, in order to run all these <span class="NPIP">places</span> , we had to have people who were knowledgeable about the gasworks, about the waterworks, about the electrical companies — and who knew these things? </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">If they weren’t members of the Nazi Party, they didn’t hold these positions, so we had to use them. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Course Patton was later accused of playing footsie with all of them, but to some extent he had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">One thing leads to another, doesn’t it? </span><span class="sentence" id="381">They all had to fill out what they called a Fraggoboggen (ph) — are you familiar with the questionnaire that the Nazis had to fill out? </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Well, it tells about their history in the Nazi Party and of course all of them said that they didn’t, or many of them had a supplement to it, which I have here, and I’m going to leave with the Archives — a supplement to the Fraggoboggen (ph) that this one man filled out. “</span><span class="sentence" id="383">T was never a member of the Nazi Party.” </span><span class="sentence" id="384">That’s what he said. “</span><span class="sentence" id="385">I was never involved in any of the atrocities.” </span><span class="sentence" id="386">They all were. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">They all were — if they weren’t actively involved in it, they were guilty because they were there and allowed it to start as far back as 1933 and did nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Or when they started coming after the Germans who disagreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And the Catholics who disagreed, after they got through with the Jews and the gypsies and the homosexuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">That’s when people started taking note. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Maybe there’s a juggernaut that we can’t stop — that we’re going to need help. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Now I’m in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were run as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">They had their own administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We had an entire Polish army complement in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I have it right here — the badges that they wore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamburg</span> (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamburg</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And later in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> , (ph) also. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> — we were constantly being inspected because, we were being inspected by all the, by major generals, and colonels, because everybody was coming down on them, from President Truman on down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">QUESTION:  Action, they wanted...
ANSWER:  They wanted, they wanted what’s going on in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So they’d come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Now, at one time, by being on temporary — this 1s just a little story. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">By being on temporary duty and away from my original company, I wasn’t able to draw any rations — any of my rations from my company — like cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We were able to get liquor, too, incidentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Heavens knows we needed a little schnapps once in a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Cigarettes, liquor and candy. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And when I tried to get it from my company, they said we didn’t draw any rations for you because, PX rations, I guess they called it, because you’re not assigned to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">You’re away on temporary duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And when I tried to get it from the <span class="BUILDING">army headquarters</span> , they said, you’re not on our roster, you’re only here on temporary duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So on one of the times that, on one of the times that my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was being inspected, when the officers got through, there were about eight of them, and I have the listing here of all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">The general just happened to mention, “You deserve a lot of credit for the work that you’ve done here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And I said, “I deserve a rest.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And the rest of the officers — I guess their chin dropped between their knees because you just don’t talk that way, . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Very G.I. And he said, “Oh, what would you like to do?” </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And you know, I was very young then, and very flip. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I said, “I think I'd like to go to the Riviera for ten days or so.” </span><span class="sentence" id="417">He said, “Oh, how soon could you be ready?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="418">How soon could you get a man here to replace me?” </span><span class="sentence" id="419">He said, “Can you be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> at 5:00 or 9:00 in the morning or whatever? </span><span class="sentence" id="420">We’ll fly you to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Riviera</span> .” “</span><span class="sentence" id="421">Certainly I can be there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="422">So before going, we had a camp barber — and the reason I’m telling you this 1s because one story begets another story — and he was cutting my hair, I had hair then. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">He was a Frenchman and I told him, I said, “Now I want you to do a good job because I’m going to the <span class="REGION">Riviera</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I’m going to stay at the <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Carlton</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nice</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monte Carlo</span> while I’m there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="426">He said, “My family lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cannes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I haven’t seen them in eight years — I haven’t written to them and there’s no way that they could write to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Would you call on them?” </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I said, “Of course.” </span><span class="sentence" id="430">He gave me their address of where they lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">They lived up above <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cannes</span> — Gros(ph)? </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Well, and one day I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> and went up there and I met his family and I invited his sister, a little 16-year-old sister to come back to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> with me to have dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Well, the <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Carlton</span> , this is where they have the Cannes Film Festival, as you know, and everything is very, very elegant there. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">There’s a waiter behind each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">The little girl was sitting there, I don’t she’s ever, I don’t what she’s ever had in the way of food, or the way it was served, but I want you to know it was quite elegant. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And she brought a little bottle of perfume for me as a gift for letting her family know that her brother was still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">That little bottle of perfume is the only thing that I have left. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">When I came back to the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> and we staged at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Philip Morris</span> — you know they named the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">staging camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> after cigarettes — I had a musette (ph) full of souvenirs — perfume, lighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I had a bottle of, I had a fifth of Three Feathers, which 1s bourbon liquor that my dad had given me two years before. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">He said, he wanted, he said, “Yasilah, (ph) I want you to give this to your colonel so he won’t send you overseas.” </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And I thought to my, I told my commanding officer, I said, “My dad wants me to give you this so you won’t send me overseas.” </span><span class="sentence" id="442">We both had a good laugh. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I thought if we landed safely, I'd break open the bottle. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Every celebration that we had, I was going to use that bottle that my dad gave me. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I never did because there was always liquor available. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And this became kind of an icon, kind of a talisman. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I thought as long as I had that, nothing’s going to happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Because it somehow, it’s somehow sacred. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">When I had this in my musette (ph) bag, with that little bottle of perfume, along with perfume for all the women in my family, Chanel, and Flue de Racai (ph), and all the Caron and I had lace from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> that I had picked up and saved to take <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as souvenirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Everything was stolen out of my <span class="INT_SPACE">stateroom</span> but that little bottle of perfume. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And, the bottle of bourbon. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And my dad and I had the first two drinks out of that bottle. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Well, I came back from the Riviera and kept working and for a while, we went, I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Veeldflecken</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Veeldflecken</span> (ph) was taken over by an Unrah (ph) team and we were already old hands at this. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I only spent two weeks there, about two weeks, and a member of the Unrah (ph) team was Kathleen Hulm (ph) who later wrote “A Nun’s Story”, that was made into a movie with Audrey Hepburn. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And I met her and I have a copy of her book. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I had a copy of her book but it’s now in the archives, here in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">It’s out of print and it’s a wonderful, wonderful account of how a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced person camp</span> is run, and how it should be run. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">All the trials, all the vicissitudes, all the problems, all the glory and all the good feelings that you have when you see a job well done. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamburg</span> (ph) and by this time there was quite an attrition among the officers and enlisted men who were going back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">They’d earned enough points to be sent back and I was put in, they had spread us out over several <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph) and that’s where I had my greatest glory if there 1s such a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And I’Il tell you what happened at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">QUESTION:  Good. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Let’s take a break and then we’ll come back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Good. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">End of Tape 1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  We’re gonna start with now, in the fall of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">You come back from the <span class="REGION">Riviera</span> and you have been assigned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">It was quite a coup, actually, I was the only officer in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I was the second lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I had six enlisted men who were gems. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">They had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , they had worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , and we were the only American army personnel in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="474">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> however, held between 11,000 and 15,000 eastern Europeans, mostly Poles.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">QUESTION:  They were there when you got there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  They were there when I got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">They’d been collecting them. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">See, nothing travels faster than a rumor in the army, or in a situation like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">When they told the people, the people who’d been slave laborers that they could get billeting and rations and so on, under the American auspices, under the American army auspices, have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sleep, have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to eat, until they could be repatriated, but, on the other hand, many of them were already, had already been repatriated and had come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Because they had been fooled by Stalin. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Stalin even sent special troops into the <span class="REGION">area</span> to sort of prepare the people for coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by telling them that you’re going to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you’re going to be with your families, you’re going to be on your <span class="DLF">farms</span> , you’re going to be in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , and life is going to be like it was before. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">It didn’t happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Once the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> were sealed, I don’t think they were really sealed in the manner that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> were sealed, that’s probably not a good word. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Once they were closed and they started the long trek to the East, when they got there, stories came back that they weren’t even allowed to go into their own <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">That they went on to various goulag in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> and spent so much time because Stalin, Stalin sent his own son to one of them, who’d been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as a slave laborer. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">He said they should have chosen death rather than work for the German war machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">That fought against <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="488">QUESTION:  Were you present for any of these — what were they called, repatriation . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">QUESTION:  . . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">.transports.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Many of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">QUESTION:  Those happened at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="495">People were organized to be sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  We would organize, we would send them to a railhead at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichtenfelds</span> (ph) which was about 15 kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph), <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="497">That was the railhead. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">We would put them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , incidentally, belonged to the 1 1" Panzer (ph) Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">They were SS troops, run by Major McLean (ph), and this is a walking stick that he later carved and gave to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Here it says, Coatsing (ph), that was their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , May the 5" 11" Panzer (ph) Division, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Although it’s a Scottish name, he was quite German. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">He had a complement of 175 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German vehicles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Some of them were halftracks, some were regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , some were similar to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeeps</span> , and some were what you might call <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pleasure cars</span> , for officers, perhaps an Opal, or one of the other small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German car</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Volkswagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And we would load them onto these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">We gave them five days ration for the long trek back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , to their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">We saw that they were well clothed, we saw that families went together, quite unlike the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> that went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="507">QUESTION:  Were these people eager to go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  Willing to go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  In the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And then we had to force them to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  How many of these...
ANSWER:  1500 a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">QUESTION:  For how long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  It seemed to go on forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">But it was around, I guess this lasted, this lasted until about March of ’46.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">QUESTION:  So, six months?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">ANSWER:  Five or six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  Daily?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">ANSWER:  Almost daily. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">The constant—we took a census of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from time to time. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">It wasn’t a daily census — maybe every week, every two weeks and found that the constant number was always between 13,000 and 15,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">But there were around 1500 a day that left for the <span class="DLF">railhead</span> and around 1500 a day that came in from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , from the <span class="REGION">German countryside</span> , people who’d continued to work, under the German — not as slave laborers. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">But some of them stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who heard about what was going on after they were being repatriated. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Some of the them wanted to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and work on the German economy. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">That didn’t last too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">They started coming into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> where they could get rations, from the American Army, from Unrah(ph), from Quakers, from — there were many organizations that would send boxes of food in. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Dry milk, dried eggs, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And this was, this was the almost, you’d almost count on 1500 going out every day or two and we have of course, we have photos of all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">They send — and they decorated the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with boughs. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">It looked like Arbor Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">They put all sorts of tree branches on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Then they had huge photos of Stalin and Lenin and they sang Russian songs and we had Russian officers at the exchange points, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichtenfelds</span> (ph) to see that everything was run properly, that they got on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Later on, to our shame, our halftracks drove up and guns were mounted on the halftracks, and they were forced to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to go back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  When did that change happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Was it — do you remember an incident where suddenly you knew that things were different or was it gradual?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  Actually, it was gradual. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And then it got to the point where I didn’t always go to the railheads. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I went there very seldom after it started running. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichtenfelds</span> (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  But in the beginning, you would go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">ANSWER:  In the beginnings, I would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">On some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> there. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">QUESTION:  But you felt the people were genuinely . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  Happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Happy, singing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  And later, when you say that the Americans had to force these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">What was the nature of that coercion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  Maybe a little subterfuge. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">A little tell the story about how nice it was going to be after they got there, that they were going to their own <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , using the same <span class="DLF">line</span> that the Russians used. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And the Russians were there to back us up, to help us with this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="551">QUESTION:  But you knew that wasn’t true?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">ANSWER:  It slowly dawned on all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">It’s in all the books now — our disgraceful forced repatriation. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">But we couldn’t do anything else — they couldn’t live with us for -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">They couldn’t live on the German economy forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Even the Germans were having — I didn’t sympathize with them that much, only as one human being to another — but they were having a difficult time. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">As a matter of fact, those who saved Jewish children started turning them over to the American army so that we would make different billets and different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And I think I showed you earlier, in the chronology of what happened during the war, that the Joint Distribution Committee and they were a tremendous during the war, a tremendous help. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">They saved my life many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Gathered up orphans from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , in the <span class="REGION">Buchenwald area</span> and sent them to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I received orders from <span class="BUILDING">Third Army headquarters</span> to form an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> for Jewish children who’d been turned back by the Germans who had saved them during the war and were turning them back to the army to be fed and clothed by army personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And there was a <span class="BUILDING">sanitarium</span> , the Strooth (ph) Sanitarium. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I don’t think I’ve mentioned that name in years. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">But now I know, that was the name of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">The Strooth (ph) Sanitarium near <span

the same time that I did for the orphans, he received orders to find billets for returning German prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And I had to put up a big fight to get this Strooth (ph) Sanitarium for my orphans. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And instead of getting 40, over 200 came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And while I’m on the story, the Joint

teaching them folk dancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And it was a wonderful, wonderful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and wonderful experience for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And one day, one -- a little girl from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> came into my <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> and gave me that block of wood that’s now in the archives at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">She had carved what looked like the Fleur de Lee (ph) that the Girl Scouts — apparently they were basing their training perhaps on what they do with the Girl Scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And she gave this to me and I saved it all these years, 50 years, until I came here 1n the end of June to turn over a lot of my artifacts and that’s one of the things that I gave to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I later heard from her, from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , it was <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> then, telling me how happy she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I haven’t been able to find that letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I saved all the letters that I received. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">My dear, dear sisters saved all the letters that I wrote for four years in the army and I have a journal for almost every day because I wrote quite a bit and I had a little <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> girl working in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the past month or so before <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started and she was putting the letters into polyurethane sleeves and so far she’s used 1200 sleeves. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">It doesn’t mean I wrote 1200 letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">This is just the year of 1945 and beginning of ’46 before I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">But several of my letters were five and six pages long. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">But I’m so happy to have this all, all four years preserved. </span><span

<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  Well, not only were they coming to an end, but the army involvement was becoming less and less and they were being turned over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Unrah</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="591">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were being run by Unrah (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Now before that time, I had to suffer through another inspection that turned out to be quite a coup for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Major General Robertson, commanding general of the 15" Corps, I believe it was, came into my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , with Major General Richardson. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And he, too, was very complimentary and then he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">He sent back a letter of commendation which I have here. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">15" Corps. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Major General Robertson. “</span><span class="sentence" id="599">I wish to take this opportunity to commend you for the excellent work you’ve done at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph) <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Displaced Persons Camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">My recent inspection revealed that your earnest efforts and ingenius use of all available facilities have solved many seemingly hopeless problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">A fine organization and administration of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> reflects the highest credit upon you and your accomplishments.”</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="609">QUESTION:  You'd just go out in the nearby <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">ANSWER:  We’d go out, well, that’s where the German — the German battalion that worked with me — they were very good at ferreting out these <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">It so happened that one of them belonged to a baroness. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">She came into my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and begged me not to touch her <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">We had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">We had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">It was in our <span class="REGION">area</span> and we needed, we needed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Before — now, do you know that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was divided into four parts after the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="617">The American Occupied Zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the British, French and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian Occupied Zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">During the early days of the Russian occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which was just north of us, I found out that there was a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> that had the leather pants that the SS troop, the motorcycle troops wore. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And there were hundreds of thousands of those leather pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So Germans, well, many Europeans love rubber stamps. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">If something has a rubber stamp on it, 1t must be authentic. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">So I had a bunch of rubber stamps made up, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph), in one of the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> that made them and it said, “Please give bearer, whatever, the above merchandise,” and stamped it military government, Unites States Military Government. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I’ve forgotten now what I put on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">But I sent these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German trucks</span> up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soldenburg</span> (ph), which was just beyond the American Occupied Zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian Occupied Zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And they loaded those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> up with all the leather pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Now the reason I did that is because in my <span class="REGION">zone</span> , my <span class="REGION">area</span> , there was a <span class="BUILDING">shoe factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">They didn’t have any uppers, but they had all the Airsots (ph) leathers, Airsots (ph) soles. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And we were buying these things, we were buying equipment from the German — or articles of clothing from the Germans for the DPs and for the slave laborers. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">We were able, with one pair of leather pants, we were able to make six pairs of shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Now I wanted to bring one pair <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , as a souvenir, but I thought if I bring a pair of shoes <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , that means somebody’s going to have to without shoes, and I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Oh, oh, do I think of that, when I see the shoes in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">That’s what I think about — what we did so that they’d have shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">DPs. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And what they did, and what they did when they took the shoes off -- the Jews before going in the <span class="INT_SPACE">undressing rooms</span> -- before going into the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So worried that our men wouldn’t have shoes and they were so worried that they couldn’t take ‘em off fast enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">They’re in the bin, aren’t they — in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">That’s what I think about. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Well, I received a letter of commendation from another major. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I won’t read it — it’s on record, thanking me for this ingenuity. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">But you do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I don’t know where it comes from. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">You — I set up a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">You have pictures of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">They had their own entertainment. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">We had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> — we had a wonderful <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I also had Polish army personnel attached to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">QUESTION:  How did that happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="648">How did they happen to be here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">ANSWER:  They had been slave laborers but they had been taken as prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">But they were army officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">They were Polish army officers and the Polish army in exile in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> decreed that they work in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to help repatriate the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And if I can put my hand on it right away, maybe I won’t take the time now, but they wore patches that said Polish Army Displaced Person, Third Army, Number Ten. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">That was my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="654">DPTA10 — that was the name of my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Oh, what a badge of honor that was — for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">It gave them the run of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="657">They had wonderful uniforms to wear — it was kind of a mixed uniform — American officer uniform and Polish officer uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">But they wore their berets with the Polish emblem on it and this nice emblem wasn’t like the yellow Star of David the Jews had to wear, in disgrace.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">QUESTION:  What was the — what were living conditions like for people at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph)? </span><span class="sentence" id="660">There were big former <span class="BUILDING">German army barracks</span> where people were housed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  They were housed in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  Can you describe the living situation? </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Were families together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Not only were families together, but sometimes when they got their potato rations, they made vodka. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And every once in a while, we had to raid the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> when we knew that there were stills, and people told us, because, actually, it was — 1t had become poisonous, a lot of the vodka that they made. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I don’t know what they mixed it with. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">They mixed it with alcohol that you put in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and there were some horrible scenes. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">But they lived, I assure you, they lived much better than they had ever lived up until that time under the German rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">QUESTION:  They had three meals a day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">ANSWER:  They had three meals a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Not only did they have three meals a day but we had a nutritionist attached to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Two nutritionists — we had an American nutritionist and one on the Unrah (ph) team. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">There was a schedule, there was a roster — so many calories for adults, so many calories for children at a certain age, so many calories for youngsters, those who got skim milk, those got regular milk with cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Incidentally, Strooth (ph) Sanitarium, for the orphans, was near <span class="DLF">Striker’s Farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Striker, who was the number one Jew-Baiter (ph) of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> — I saw him — I went to the Nuremburg war trials one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">We were able to get eggs and butter and milk from his <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">His <span class="DLF">farm</span> functioned during the entire war — it never stopped producing. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">At first 1t bothered me and then I thought why should it bother me? </span><span class="sentence" id="681">We’re getting all this good stuff from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Incidentally, we got fresh vegetables and butter and fresh meat from the German economy. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">We had demands, we had regular requisitions that we gave the military, the German military command, in each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and they had to supply so much.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="769">ANSWER:  Up until that time, up until that time, there were Jews, but they came in as DPs. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">This was in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">They came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and when I knew who they were, and they had their own way of, of, of being in their own group. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And when they realized that this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was really a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">repatriation camp</span> , a camp that was sending people back east, when they realized they couldn’t go back, then they wanted to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And who took them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="774">What irony. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">My German major from the Panzer (ph) Division in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Loaded them up — and he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And I knew that he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">But they got very good treatment and they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in southern <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">There was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ogsburg</span> (ph), there was a camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ogsburg</span> (ph), there was a camp at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strowbing</span> (ph), there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> there was one they called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Funk Casairn</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="780"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casairn</span> (ph) means <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="781">I knew that that was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish camp</span> and he and his men had orders to take the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">QUESTION:  So after what period of time — do you remember when that was, in the winter of ’45, maybe, that soon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">ANSWER:  Early °46.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">QUESTION:  Early °46.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">ANSWER:  Beginning, beginning in winter of ’45 and early ’46. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Now, when, when Unrah (ph) started taking over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , I was transferred. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I’m trying to think if there was anything more I wanted to tell you about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> , except that 1t was running rather smoothly, although people started trickling back and telling their countrymen that they weren’t allowed to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , that they were sent to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So that meant that more came in and that we would have to continue to take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">On Bastille Day in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , one of the French officers almost blew up the camp celebrating Bastille Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Jacques Jencam (ph) was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And when he left, he told me if I ever got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to be sure and look him up, which I later did, but that’s, Pll go into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Now, I, when the work was running smoothly in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and, as I said, they had their own <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , they had their own entertainment. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">We were invited to many of the affairs that they had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , as guests of honor, and I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I danced to many a oom- pah-pah band and Polish, and the polka. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I liked to dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Then I was transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Onzbock</span> (ph) which was outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And I was put in charge of several <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> and also the exchange point at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoapf</span> , (ph) <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and we have that on the map. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Now the reason it was called an exchange point is because, apparently, and I believe it was at the Yalta Conference, we, that is the four major powers, said that we would repatriate the Germans, also, who had been displaced because of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">German for German, who had been displaced prior to September the 1°, 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And they all, and they came from <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> into the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoapf</span> (ph), <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And I was in charge of that exchange point. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And it was through this exchange point, the Jews came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">They also had gone back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , or wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And they thought that they, well they did, they knew their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were already occupied, their <span class="DLF">farms</span> had been occupied, and they were being killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">The progroms had started. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">A little anecdote. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">When the Allies got onto the government of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , after the war, immediately after the war, and started chastising them for starting these anti-Semitic picadilloes again, this one telegram that they got, or communicae that they got, said, “I don’t understand how you can be so unhappy with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">We’ve only burned one <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> since last August.” </span><span class="sentence" id="810">This 1s what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="811"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> (ph), <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> (ph), the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> (ph), that had 200,000 Jews before the war, two of them came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">The Lodz (ph) Uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">When they were subdued, they were all taken out, but 40 of them hid 1n the, in various <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> , underground <span class="INT_SPACE">sewers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="814">This is why they either didn’t go, or went and came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Poles wanted to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">They didn’t want to give up their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="817">They didn’t want to give up their <span class="DLF">farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="818">I’m not talking about the Poles that came to American during the mass migration in 1906 and 1909. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">They came for the same reason my folks came — to get away from religious persecution and to have a better life for their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">There was a Polish family that took care of all of us in Saint, little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joseph</span> , Missouri. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">They were like brothers and sisters to my father and mother because they spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">My folks did too -- Russian Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">These are people that had been so indoctrinated with the hatred who had helped, I think they showed the Nazis a few things, and so did the Estonians and Lithuanians and the Latvians. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">They came out smelling like a rose, too, after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">To make Patton say, when he talked about the dirty, filthy Jews, he said, “They’re nothing like the Estonians.” </span><span class="sentence" id="826">Well, how could they be? </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Where was the soap? </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Where were the water levels in the billets that they were in? </span><span class="sentence" id="829">There wasn’t any water, there wasn’t any running water! </span><span class="sentence" id="830">How could they use the latrines or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="831">He didn’t think about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And it was against his Anglo-Saxon sensitivities to put them in <span class="BUILDING">German homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="833">You can’t displace Germans! </span><span class="sentence" id="834">For the Jews? “</span><span class="sentence" id="835">I can’t do that,” he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I’m digressing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="837">QUESTION:  Let’s talk about Hoapf (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">QUESTION:  How did you organize that? </span><span class="sentence" id="840">It sounds like a big job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="841">ANSWER:  It was a big job. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">It was a big job and I didn’t do it alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">We had security troops there stationed...
QUESTION:  Can you remind me, give me a little time frame here? </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Do you remember roughly when you went to that assignment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">ANSWER:  March.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="846">QUESTION:  Were we talking March?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">ANSWER:  March. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">We’re talking about March, ’46.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="849">QUESTION:  Spring.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="850">ANSWER:  February, March.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">ANSWER:  We had security patrols around there and we had, we had people, <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> set up and they all had papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">They all had the, they all had the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Everyone had papers . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="855">QUESTION:  Everyone...
ANSWER:  Germans had papers, the Jews coming across had their papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I don’t think that they were the correct papers, I know that they weren’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I know that they were false papers but they were coming in as German nationals. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And they had been doing that for months. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I know at least that ’d helped about 900 come through. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And this one time, I might as well get onto this story, because it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">There were 125 caught coming, Jews, coming across the <span class="DLF">border</span> with, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoapf</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="862">They had the security patrol pick them up and he called in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Onzbock</span> (ph), and wanted to know what to do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">I said, “Put them all in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoapf</span> (ph).” </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Now this is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mittenwald</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="865"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mittenwald</span> (ph) is the county and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoapf</span> (ph) is the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="866">The Joint Distribution Committee was working out of the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and they were handling all the Jews, many of the Jews that were coming through. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Now there’s a lot that enters into this. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">The extreme efficiency of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">By now the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were running, by now the electricity was on, all the gas, water and that wasn’t too long after the war ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="870">QUESTION:  Less than a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">ANSWER:  Less than a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And the people that were supposed to be doing all this were still back in the <span class="BUILDING">military government schools</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">University of Michigan</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> or <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> — the <span class="BUILDING">Ivy League schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="873">They were learning German, they were learning Polish, they were learning Russian, they were learning French, so that they’d know how to handle the DPs when they got to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">They got there after it was all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">But it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And now this was an officer — this was a captain, the security officer and he wanted to know what to do with their papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I said, “Send them to me by courier,” and incidentally, among my pictures that I gave Bob Kesting (ph), just yesterday, I have a picture of the courier. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And it got to me, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Onzbock</span> (ph), to my billet, at the Golden Eshtairn (ph) Hotel, about three in the morning, and I burned them. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">It just seemed to be the thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">You have evidence of some transgression — you get rid of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">QUESTION:  And — meaning you knew these were false papers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">ANSWER:  It really didn’t matter — about burning them because I knew that they could make new papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">It amounted to just the same as the paper — but I didn’t want to have any of the evidence because of what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">I knew I would have to account for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">By morning, by morning, they were all out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="887">The guards had been bribed with money, with drinks, with liquor and the Jews were on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , again going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish DP camps</span> in the American Occupied Zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="888">The story doesn’t end there with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">I was called into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> —my commanding officer’s office — who was a colonel. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And I shan’t tell you his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I’ve never mentioned his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">He was regular army. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">He had appropriated the finest chalet in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Onzbock</span> , for his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">They were coming over. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">After all, this was a war of occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">He had appropriated one of Hitler’s specially built <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes-Benz</span> bullet-proof <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">touring cars</span> for his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And he called me in because the security officer at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hoapf</span> (ph) told him what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">He said, “What do you know about this?” </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I said “Well, I know that 125 Jews, approximately, 125 Jews tried to come across the <span class="DLF">border</span> last night and I told the captain to put them all in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="900">He said “Well, they’re all gone now. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">Where do you think they are?’ </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And I said “Well, I think they’re all very happily ensconced in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish DP camps</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> , in <span class="REGION">southern Germany</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="903">He said, “You know, this is conduct unbecoming an American officer and I’m going to have to court-martial you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Well. “</span><span class="sentence" id="905">We, Pll send for someone from the Judge Advocate Division, <span class="BUILDING">Third Army headquarters</span> to come up and take a deposition. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Meanwhile, you’re under arrest of <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> at the Golden Eshtairn (ph) Hotel.” </span><span class="sentence" id="907">I found this the other night. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I knew something would happen — I wouldn’t be able to put my hands on these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">Nevertheless, that’s where we were billeted. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">It was a little embarrassing to go from his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , with two MPs, one on each side of me and put me under arrest of quarters in my <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And I could only leave to go to eat, also, under guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">He, I saw him afterwards, before the, it would have been the attorney from the judge advocate, judge advocate’s office, whatever, to come up and take a deposition prior to a court martial — I saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">My colonel. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And I said, “Colonel” — now I want you to know that I was just a kid, according to what I am now, I was just a kid, but you grow up very fast in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I said, “I don’t know what’s going to happen to me if you court martial me. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">I’m sure I'll be breaking rocks at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Leavenworth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="917">But you’re going to be right beside me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="918">He said, “What do you mean?” </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I said, “I'll just have to tell them how you allowed all your men to go into my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , your officers gave them furloughs and leaves to go into my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> and shack up with the women in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="920">You gave them extra rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">You drew army rations that you shouldn’t have so that they could have a wonderful time sleeping with my women in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> !” </span><span class="sentence" id="922">They were so bold and so blazen about this that they walked around in their uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">They didn’t even bother to get into civilian clothes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="924">QUESTION:  And that was forbidden, that they should go...
ANSWER:  Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Couldn’t fraternize with them at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">There were all sorts of directives. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">We had a little pamphlet that Bradley put out. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">It’s in the archives — I gave it to them. “</span><span class="sentence" id="930">So Pll have to tell them that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And he thought for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I said, ““You know, you can delegate command in the army, as a colonel, you can tell me, as a captain, what to do, but the responsibility is still your responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And all this happened under your nose.” </span><span class="sentence" id="934">What’s 125 Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="935">There were close to a thousand. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">This had been going on for months. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">It didn’t mean anything to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">The lives of 125 Jews, or even a thousand, compared to what he was going to have after his family came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">This fine chalet in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Onzbock</span> (ph) where they could go skiing at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Garmish</span> (ph), Garmish Pardonkershem (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Where they could go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremburg</span> , where the Passion Play already started. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And over Amergal (ph), they could have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Oh, I don’t know how he ended up. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Probably, may be, maybe made general one day, who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I was, but. . .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="949">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">End of Tape #2 Tape #3
QUESTION:  Dr. Friedman, you were telling us, in the last tape about your having allowed these 125 Jews to come through Hoapf (ph), which means that you understood the underground organization that had been created in Europe to move Jews from east to west and eventually down to the Mediterranean — their passage to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="953">QUESTION:  Explain how you became aware of this and how do you witness its function?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="954">ANSWER:  That’s very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Sometime in the summer of ’45, perhaps around June...
QUESTION:  ’45? </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Right after the end of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="957">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">A group of Palestinian officers, now we must remember it wasn’t called <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> then, they were Jewish officers who had fought with the Palestinian brigade in <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And they had permission from <span class="BUILDING">Third Army headquarters</span> and they had their papers with them and they had a roster of families and names with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And you have a picture of that in your archives. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And I’m so proud of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I’m standing right in the middle of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">I just wanted to be with them because of what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">They were trying to find, ostensibly, they were trying to find, survivors of the relatives of members of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Palestinian Brigade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Well, this is true, they were, and they did find as many as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">But, it was to be a cover for the Jewish Underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And what they were trying to do was to get the sympathies of the American Jewish officers, mostly American Jewish officers, although a very dear friend of mine that I worked with who is non-Jewish helped a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And therein lies another story but, and when they realized that I would do all that I could to help out, they, they were satisfied and pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And I think, I think if, if the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> would blow up this photo that I had, that there might be some faces on there that are easily recognizable because I’m sure that they later became leaders in the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or in, again, with repatriation of, of Jewish DPs, Jewish slave laborers. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">And I think we might find among them some who had really dedicated the rest of their lives to this type of work.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="997">QUESTION:  And did they identify themselves as an organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="998">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">They had, they had legitimate papers that were given to them by the military government of the Third Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">They’d come up, the papers were dated and had the letterheads — were from the <span class="BUILDING">Third Army Headquarters</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bod Toles</span> (ph) which was south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and it was very legitimate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">The legitimate part was that they were looking for survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">The other <span class="NPIP">part</span> was that they were also looking for people who were sympathetic towards getting the Jews into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , helping them get into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">But, God bless the Jews, they sort of organized themselves and knew where they wanted to go, and knew how to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">They just, they just couldn’t have, didn’t want any interference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">There was still, you see when the war ended, there was such a, there was such a, a, thrust by the Germans, the young Germans, to poison the minds of the American soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">Now these were soldiers who had never fought in any of the wars, they were fresh from the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and they came in and they saw all the dirty DPs and they saw the dirty French and they saw the dirty Poles, and they saw the dirty this and the dirty that, and the nice clean efficient Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">Well, of course they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">All the soap went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . “</span><span class="sentence" id="1009">Course they might have been washing themselves with one of their ancestors, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">We know how some of the soap was made. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">In fact, I have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , or had one, that had the Nina, one of Columbus’s <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessels</span> , a copy of it, and the sails were made out of human skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">And I wanted to bring it back and put it in one of the <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And I did bring it back, but it’s disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1016">QUESTION:  ... after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1017">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Not all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Not all but this was just another little murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">This was another little battle that we had to contend with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">They didn’t have to draw, they didn’t have to draw KP anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">The Germans did that, the Germans peeled the potatoes, the Germans did the cooking for the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">They didn’t have to draw extensive guard duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">You know, there was no more, you know there was no more fear of being invaded, of having your, your command post taken over by Germans or any kind of invading army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Was no longer in existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">All they had to do was sleep with the German girls and drink the champagne and schnapps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">It was a great life! </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">We didn’t want these dirty people to interfere with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">Get rid of ‘em. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Put ‘em in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1032">QUESTION:  And that was the overwhelming sentiment, you think, of the average G.I.?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1033">ANSWER:  I really do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">Maybe I’m very cynical about it, maybe I’m overemphasizing it, but I saw it right after the war ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Perhaps with all the directives that were sent out and that little booklet that every soldier had to have, that Omar Bradley — you have it, they have it at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">I gave it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">Perhaps with that, 1f they complied with what he asked them to, things might have been better afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">But they were seeing the world through Uncle Sam and having a ball. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">They knew nothing about what went before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">If they had read about it, or if they were told about it, it didn’t have the force or the power or the — it didn’t affect them the way it did the soldiers who were right there and really knew what had happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1041">QUESTION:  By that you mean — what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1042">ANSWER:  They didn’t go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1043">QUESTION:  Most of the G.I.s never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">So they didn’t really understand . . .</span></p>

QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1059">ANSWER:  ... and Truman wanted separate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> set up for Jews if the — go into the <span class="BUILDING">German homes</span> , had no qualms about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">Didn’t bother them to go into the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> and kick everybody out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1061">QUESTION:  But you are, I think saying, that part of the reason for the surreptitious nature of this effort to get Jews out was resistance by American military personnel, as well as the law prohibiting Jews from migrating to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1062">ANSWER:  Well, you know, everybody was torn during those times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">If you wanted to obey directives, if you knew that they couldn’t land in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , then you tried to do — I’m talking about regular army — you thought why, why would I put them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">Or why, why would I try to get them down to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> so that they could get on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ‘cause they’re not going to take them anyway? </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">They won’t take them — they started taking them in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> , incidentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">We didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">We didn’t take them until much later but that’s a whole other story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Again, it was very chaotic, even at that time, as to what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">Most important thing was to see that they were well fed and clothed and had some degree of contentment and family because they, and, in some way, and some way that they could really reckon with their tremendous loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1070">QUESTION:  And the people that were coming from east to west, among them the 125 that you have already described — who were they, mostly?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1109">ANSWER:  Yeah, but I had to be very careful, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">I had, I had, above all, I was an American army officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">I was in charge of the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Displaced Person Camps</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , as well as this exchange point so I had to sort of walk

<p><span class="sentence" id="1127">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">Only the one, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">None of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">But of course those who came through my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph), I knew when they were coming through and I knew when they were going out with the, in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they got special care — food, clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">Years later, well let’s go back to where, if you like, where I was almost court-martialed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">Is that alright? </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">Anyway, I was put under arrest of quarters in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Onzbock</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">In the Golden Eshtairn (ph) <span class="BUILDING">Hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And as I said before, I told the colonel that you can’t, that the responsibility was all his and it was under his command. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Now and he had all his family coming over, they were all ready to come over for the duration, however long that was going to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">And the next day, there were orders that came from <span class="BUILDING">Third Army Headquarters</span> sending me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">That’s among the orders that you have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">Now they would send divisions home, they would send battalions <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and my orders came through, one person, Captain Joe Friedman, report to Camp Philip Morris. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And I was escorted by the two military government, by the two MPs, to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">We went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> — we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> there for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">Now Jacques Jangcam (ph), who had the Bourbon (ph) signet ring, or crest, told me that if I ever got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , to call him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">Well, we had to change <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , either from the Guardinore (ph), or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">I don’t remember because, because it’s been 50 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">But I took a chance and I called him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">Had his phone number in my little book when I knew I was going through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and I called him and he asked me — and he was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And he asked me where I was and I told him I was at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And I told him what the circumstances were — that were two MPs guarding me — but at the time they were looking at magazines and French postcards in the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And he said, “I know that <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">He said, “I'll be over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">You stay in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">phone booth</span> and pretend that you’re talking to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">I’Il be over there in about ten minutes and when you see me in the <span class="DLF">doorway</span> , you come out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">telephone booth</span> and come right to where I am and we’ ll get in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I’Il take you <span class="BUILDING">home</span> — to my, to my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">And that’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">I don’t think anything happened to the MPs, because they were all so happy to get rid of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">I’m sure that when he went back, when they went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Onzbock</span> (ph), and told the colonel what had happened, he probably felt that it would be fine if I was arrested for being AWOL, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">But, what actually happened was that Jacques took me to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> happened to be a floor through <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the Trockadeero (ph) Section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And you could see the Eiffel Tower from their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">And it was the type of <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> opened up into their, well as long as it’s French I’d better say <span class="INT_SPACE">foyer</span> , but it opened up into their <span class="INT_SPACE">foyer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And I, his grandmother lived with them, and I received her, I was given her <span class="INT_SPACE">suite</span> of <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> while I was there, which consisted of a <span class="INT_SPACE">sitting room</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">And I was served breakfast in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">In fact, I had to wait until the maid got out, left the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> so I could get out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and put the tray on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dresser</span> so I could have breakfast comfortably. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">I found out what the signet ring was: their <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> — they had tapestries all over the, all over the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they were these tapestries that depicted all the wars that the Bourbons (ph) had fought in from whenever to wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And he was the descendant of the kings and it didn’t mean anything to him except that he had this signet ring that he wore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And it was also in needlepoint on the back of all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And Jacques had a sister who showed me around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">Louvre</span> — we did all the typical tourist things and I was there for about four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">I was very anxious — I was a little afraid that something might happen and I did leave after, I think it was four or five days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">But I’d been to the Leedo (ph) and the Moulon (ph) Rouge and the Casino de Paris and to the <span class="DLF">Napoleon’s tomb</span> and the famous <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> — well, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">I'll think of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And I got to <span class="BUILDING">Camp Philip Morris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">I could have stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> for a month! </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">When I reported there, they said, “Well, you’ Il go out on the next available <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">Washtub is what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">victory ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">I crossed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , the SS something <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> which was a huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luxury vessel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">Took us four and a half days to cross — took me ten days to get back, and it was during that time and I was in a <span class="INT_SPACE">stateroom</span> with other officers, and that’s when all my things were stolen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">With the exception of that one bottle of perfume and the fifth of Three Feathers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">That was a very popular brand of bourbon during the war that I later had with my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">Then, I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I had a very difficult time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I was being separated from the service at <span class="BUILDING">Jefferson Barracks</span> and I sort of broached on this subject when we were talking before, but the first person I saw was a friend of mine that I grew up with in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joe</span> and he was playing cards in the officers’ recreation room. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">And I ran up to him and I said, “Paul!” </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">You know, I was so happy to be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> !

<p><span class="sentence" id="1203">ANSWER:  Nothing, nothing, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">Nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1205">QUESTION:  So what, what was it like then, to be a civilian, suddenly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">You mentioned it was hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1207">ANSWER:  Very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">Very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">I, in the army you always wait for someone to tell you what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">It doesn’t matter whether you’re a private and the corporal tells you to pick up cigarette butts or clean the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> , or your platoon leader, your captain tells you to shape up these men — go on bivouac, maneuvers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">There’s always someone above you to tell you what to do and I was waiting for someone to tell me what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">I had this brother and sister living out in <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> and I went to visit them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">And I spent almost the entire summer there — went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , breathing some nice fresh air and just relaxing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And slowly, the time was coming to go, when I would have to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> — if I wanted to finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And I was really very reluctant to go and I think that this same thing followed me, this same feeling followed me until I gave up practice until I gave up my practice and left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joseph</span> to seek my career — another career in the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">I had the typical midlife crisis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">I did go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because I thought let me finish one thing that I started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">Let me at least do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">But I was very unhappy when I went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Many men, many of the students in my class were much younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">They had just come out of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> or you know, they’d gotten a B.A. in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and had gone on to <span class="BUILDING">podiatry school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">And quite a few were married and I was kind of an old man at 26. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And an angry old man because the world had passed me by. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">And I’d lost four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">I really hadn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">It was the most formative four years that I could have had to prepare me for what came later and that was just — that was life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joseph</span> to practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">My first year back at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , though, was the hardest and I knew that I would need help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">And the Veterans Administration had a counseling service at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> and I was able to go there, on Saturdays, every week for about six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">And I had a very intense and intensive meeting with a very, very good psychologist, analyst, therapist, counselor that finally culminated in taking various tests. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">I took, but I tried, I tried as objective as I could with these tests and they grade you, you know, on the curve. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">Like, say in law, maybe four people will be better than you are if you follow that <span class="DLF">field</span> but 95 won’t be as good as you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">And, as I said, I tried to be as objective as I could in taking the tests but the results were that I would probably be best in personnel management, law and then medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">Medicine, of course, I’d had two years of pre-med prior to going into <span class="BUILDING">podiatry school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">So, I’m sure that that showed up in the exams. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">And I came back and I practiced and I had a very lucrative practice for 14 years and then I had the typical midlife crisis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">And I see, gee, and I kept thinking about life back in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> and how tenuous it is and how it just could hang by a thin thread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And you’re here today and tomorrow the whole thing could be wiped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">So live each day and, that’s not knew with me, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">But live it the way you want to live it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And live it the way it'll give you the most pleasure, not the most remuneration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">But just that’1l make you a good man and I picked the most difficult profession in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">And I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joe</span> and joined a melodrama troupe in <span class="REGION">Colorado</span> , on the <span class="DLF">western slope</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">They called it the Kerosene (ph) Circuit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And I played <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aspen</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glenwood Springs</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leadville</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Durango</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Steamboat Springs</span> — did it an entire summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And I was 42 years old then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1248">QUESTION:  As an actor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1249">ANSWER:  As an actor in a melodrama. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And I was fat and bald at that time, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">But at the end of the season I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and David Merrick, who was a very well-known producer at the time, wasn’t waiting for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">There was no red carpet, and I knew that if I wanted to do <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , I’d have to study and, at least the glossary of the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">Even the terms: stage right, stage left, although in <span class="BUILDING">civic theater</span> , I did quite a bit of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">Except we say now, “You go on that side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stage</span> ,” when you’re saying it and “you go on the other side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stage</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">But, nevertheless, I did well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">I started doing the soaps and I started doing, I did a couple of Broadway shows. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">I did several off-Broadway shows. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">I toured in industrials, I did commercials and I met my dear, dear lovely wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">She was a gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1260">QUESTION:  Now, I’d like to ask you, if I could, if, you’ ve mentioned that your father was an Orthodox Jew, and that he was observant, and that your parents both came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> from a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...

<p><span class="sentence" id="1267">ANSWER:  Well, a lot of things entered into it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">Yes they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">To begin with, I’Il just give you a short history of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">My father came over in the great wave of immigration, 1906. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">He was married, already, and had a child — my oldest brother, who will be 87 in November, next month. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">And he started peddling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">It’s the typical American story of the Jews who came over and put a pack on their back which he did, and sold needles and notions and dry goods — whatever he could carry — until he made enough money to buy a horse so that he could carry more things over into <span class="REGION">Kansas</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joseph</span> , <span class="REGION">Missouri</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">It’s on the <span class="DLF">border</span> between the, right on the <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="REGION">Kansas</span> and <span class="REGION">Missouri</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">Made enough money then to buy a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> so he could carry more goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">Then made enough money to bring Mother over and my brother and his sister. ’'</span><span class="sentence" id="1277">m giving you all this background because of what has happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">When he had his family over, when he had Mother, he didn’t want to go peddling anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">He wanted to establish, to take root somewhere — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">So he opened up a <span class="BUILDING">feed store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">After all, there were no, there were very few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">I once read what, what really has happened in my lifetime in the way of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> and radio and television and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and all the computers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">This has all happened, gee, in this century — not even the entire century, beginning, I remember listening to the radio on the little battery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">What’d they call — my brother made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">We would listen, we had earphones and I’d listen on one and he’d listen on the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">But then, we had the last, after the <span class="BUILDING">feed store</span> and when there weren’t too many more horses, Dad opened up a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">In 1919, and to this day, my brother-in-law has that <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">He and my oldest sister took over the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from, when my brother-in-law came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">Incidentally, my brother-in-law and I were both in the same unit, until we were separated and I went into all this other work and he stayed with the 95" Infantry Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">And every once in a while, if he has two beers, he’ II let you know how he took Metts (ph) — and, and he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">Wonderful, wonderful man but I just lost my sister a few months before my wife died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">These letters that she saved...

ANSWER:  Now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , there were a number of things that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">Oh, but I grew up in a very Orthodox family but I was younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">Now my brother, after his Bar-Mitzvah, he did the tfillin (ph), I guess until he got, until after he got married and I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> and I studied. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">I can read Hebrew today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">I don’t know everything — I can’t interpret it, but I can read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">And I was bar-mitzvahed, but that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">I was too busy, afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">I, I followed two sisters who were National Honor Society, and Quill and Scroll and all the honors in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and when they heard my name, they said, “Oh, you’re Lil’s brother and you’re Bess’s brother.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">There’s the two sisters between my oldest brother and myself. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Oh!” </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">And they expected me to do everything that they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">And I, during the Depression I worked — worked at the <span class="BUILDING">drugstore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">And I was just busy — busy keeping myself going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">It was rather selfish, I presume, but it was difficult being Jewish in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Not as difficult as it is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">We only have about 200 souls in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joseph</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">Before the war, there were around 4500. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">We didn’t become assimilated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">We had our own <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">We had our own fraternity, sorority — we had our own groups that we socialized with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">Little by little, course we couldn’t go to the St. Joseph Country Club, which is a joke that I had on them much later on when I received Alumnus of the Year from my <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and the dinner was held at the St. Joseph Country Club. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">There were many times when I refused to go there — they couldn’t allow Jews as members, they certainly didn’t want us there when we were receiving any kind of honors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">It’s all changed now, however. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">But I wasn’t as, I really wasn’t as observant as my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on holidays with him and when my mother passed away I said Koddish (ph) when I could, as many times as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">Also, I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , there were times that I received, there was a time when I received a letter from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> saying that mother was recuperating before I received a letter saying what was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">Mother’d had, had gone to <span class="BUILDING">Mayo Clinic</span> for a mastectomy in 19, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">And she’d lived to 1954 when it had metastasized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">So all this took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">You asked me if I was as observant a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">I, I thought God had forsaken my people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">I really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">I was very angry with Him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">How could you let this happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">So I was going to get even. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">I Just wouldn’t do anything that He wanted me to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">What were the prayers? </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">So, they were hollow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">Why would He listen to mine when He didn’t listen to their cries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">I heard them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">I don’t think I really know to this day and that was reinforced because He took my wife away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">He, she, the spirit, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">But I do know this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">Though it didn’t happen to me, those who did believe, and today, those who believe with all their heart and those who believe the way my dad did, had a much easier time of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">For some reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1340">QUESTION:  You spent the last 50 years angry? </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">About what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1342">ANSWER:  I never spoke about it — I couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">I’ve probably talked more now in these few hours than I have my whole lifetime, since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">Oh, there was a time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , when I was living there, that one of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> teachers was rewriting history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">And he said that this really didn’t happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">He was teaching his classes that all these emaciated bodies were coming from Central Casting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">And, course we hear these stories over and over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">And my optometrist, at the time, was a survivor — an emigre, and he was telling me about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">And I told him my involvement in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> and he asked me if I would work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">They were going to set up a round robin with survivors and liberators, such as myself, in a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">And it was, I think it was on <span class="DLF">Wilshire Boulevard</span> , on <span class="DLF">Pico Boulevard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">There was a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> that had <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span> and we were going to have a round robin about, well I have all the papers — we were going to take turns and tell our story over and over and over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">And the <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span> that were bussed in would be in this class and then they would do — they would go, each one of them, in time, would hear the story of about six of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">And incidentally, the Fonz was one of them — Henry Winkler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">I think that that was the main attraction for a lot of these kids that came in because, you know, Happy Days was running on the crest of television waves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">And I got involved, then, and that’s, that was the change of name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">I think you, I was using Joe Frederick at the time because when I went into the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , you couldn’t have a very ethnic- sounding name if you wanted to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">In fact, the first man that interviewed me for a job said that he looked at his calendar and when he saw Joe Friedman, he said, he thought to himself, he said, “Eh, another accountant? </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">Another insurance salesman? </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">I have plenty of insurance and I have my own accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">I don’t need anybody like that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">And he told me this when I went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">He was the director of Love of Life and Secret Storm — these were soaps that were going on at that time, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">And I wanted to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">He says, “You'll never work under the name of Joe Friedman.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">Well, I wanted to keep the same initials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">And also, a strange thing happened before I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Joe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">One of my patients called me Frederick, by accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">She called me Dr. Frederick and I thought, gee, what a nice sounding name and it’s the same initial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">But I didn’t have to worry about that because there was a dancer in the Equity, one of the actors’ union, who was Joe Friedman, and it didn’t matter to him — he was a dancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">And so I couldn’t use my name, anyway. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1372">Cause you can’t use the same name in the union. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">So it became Joe Frederick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">And that’s how it was when I did this round robin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">And as a result of that, we were honored at the <span class="BUILDING">Wilshire Boulevard Temple</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> when they were, as liberators — there were several and there all pictures here, and I was given a certificate by Vice-President Mondale. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">And I’m very proud of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">The only other time, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> that I spoke of it and, again, I keep referring to the pictures that I have and I left 1t with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> — the Ludz (ph) survivors have a very strong club in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">A very affluent club and they do wonderful work with the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">And they called the Federation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> and asked for entertainers for a fundraiser that they were going to have and I was sent to go to this <span class="BUILDING">Beverly Hills mansion</span> and entertain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">I have a little act that I do — I was in Fiddler on the Roof for three years — I did close to 3,000 performances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Las Vegas</span> for four months with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">So I sing, and I, and I do Al Jolson. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">I used to go down on my knee, but then when I couldn’t get up one time, I stopped that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">At any rate, this Shobby Shoptie (ph) who’s a terrorist from, he’s one of the leading exponents of, an Israeli on terrorism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">He was the main speaker and I was the entertainment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">And I felt because of the occasion, and because they were all Ludz (ph) people from the, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , that I would tell them a little bit about my experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">And I started talking and a lady came up and she threw her arms around me and she said, “You saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">I know who you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">I was in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">That’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">We both had a good cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">She was in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">She was on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph) going down to, it was the Funk Casairn (ph) — she told me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1395">QUESTION:  Shall we take a break? </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">We’ll pick it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">End of Tape #3 Tape #4
ANSWER:  Here we have a picture of members of the Palestinian Brigade, who came into my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> around the end of June. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">They had a list of members of the Palestinian Brigade who fought in <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> and ostensibly they wanted to see if there were still relatives of members of the Brigade that were alive and living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Displaced Person Camps</span> and they had legitimate orders from <span class="BUILDING">Third Army Headquarters</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bogtoles</span> (ph) to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and when they came into mine, I was very happy to see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">And, underneath it all, they were looking for the possibility of the sympathies of the American Jewish officers who might help out informing the links between various camps for Jewish DPs, who were coming out of the Russian Occupied Zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">American Occupied Zone</span> for a number of reasons that we’ve already talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">So that they could go down to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and get on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">This is an aerial view of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph) was a tremendous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German army camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">As you can see, all the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were built out of brick to last forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">Unlike our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , we built out <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> out of wood and plaster, and tore them down right after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">But <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had theirs to go on forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">Fortunately, we had these because we knew that we were going to house the displaced persons in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> after the war ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">So they did serve a great purpose for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">This is a wonderful Unrah (ph) team that were immeasurable help in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph) for me and they’re sort of a polygog of nationalities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">The head of the Unrah (ph) team on the extreme left, the man, the balding man, was royalty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">He was related to the royals of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">And the one kneeling in front of him was White Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">And she was married to an official of <span class="BUILDING">Macy’s</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and felt that during the time that they escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , people helped her family and this was the only way that she could pay back in kind and she joined this Unrah (ph) team — spoke excellent Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">In fact, she spoke about five different languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">The other members — there were two doctors, two nutritionists, a nutritionist for the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , a nutritionist for the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , a nurse and chauffeurs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">And they worked day and night, right along with us, and God bless them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">This is a typical <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> that, carrying the displaced persons from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph) to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lichtenfelds</span> (ph) which 1s a railhead, and, as you know, it was a happy time for them until they later learned what their fate held in store after they got to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">But nevertheless, they decorated the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with leaves and trees and branches and also with pictures of their leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">I don’t know where those pictures came from — they just appeared out of nowhere and were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">And we saw to it that they plenty of food and clothing and sent families back together, quite unlike other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that carried out people to <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">This is a photo of Russians and American soldiers, at, at a <span class="DLF">checkpoint</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">They were there to see that things were carried out according to our own United States directives and the Russian directives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">At first, they were very, rather shy, the Russians, and not as talkative as our American officers, but later on there was quite a symbiotic relationship that developed between the two. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">We wanted things from them and they wanted things from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">And between the two forces we got quite a bit done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">Well, that happens to be a picture of me, in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">That was a 1936 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes convertible</span> , I think they called it a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabrolay</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">And I got it quite legitimately — we paid for it — the Germans couldn’t use a lot of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> because they couldn’t get gasoline for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">In order for me to be able to draw gasoline and to have it serviced at the <span class="DLF">motor pool</span> , I had to have it painted OD, and had to put the army emblem on it, a white star on it, and I put some fictitious ordinance number on the hood of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">So there you have it, I’m, if the authorities find out at this late date, I'll probably have to go to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">This obviously is a wedding that was held in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamburg</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph) at the time, and they invited me to come up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamburg</span> (ph), because they were people that I had worked with when I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bamburg</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">The groom is Sergeant Richard Lane and the bride, her name 1s Hettie. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">I don’t know her last name but she was Estonian and she had been a dental assistant and very bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">Her matron of honor was also from the, from one of the <span class="REGION">Baltic countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">And then, I’m, you can see part of my head behind her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">We were all in the wedding party and it was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">It was nice to know that life could go on and that some of the institutions that we revered throughout life could take place under these most extreme circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">As a footnote to this, many, many years later, I visited Hettie and Bob in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">They had both gone back to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and were very, very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">A happily married couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">This was an <span class="BUILDING">entertainment hall</span> that we had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">They had their own musicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">They did requisition musical instruments and I have a whole roster here of what they requisitioned: guitars and violins, accordions — they all played accordions and the Bolla Lika (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">I really thought that before it was all over with, I'd be an expert at doing the, the Kuzotzka (ph) or the polka. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">One of the other, or both. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">But, I enjoyed going to these concerts and they enjoyed having us there because they realized that we were interested in the cultural aspect of their life as well as the necessities, the other necessities of life such as eating, clothing and a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over their heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">This was a bonus for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">Here I am again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">Periodically, of course, I inspected the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and would see to it that they had enough in the <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">We were always, always after enough wood so that we could heat the cauldrons that made the soup which was the mainstay of all the DPs in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">We would cut down entire <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> in order to get enough wood and here’s an example of how we would stockpile it and store it and just, it was as valuable as gold to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">As we spoke of this before, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was run the same way an entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> would be run. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">And this is the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">Many of the doctors, I should say that the majority of the doctors, were Polish although they, we would, they would answer to American medical, members in the medical corps of the American army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">And they received wonderful treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">Whatever they requisitioned for the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> we were able to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">We would either get it from our own medical supply or we would get it from the German medical supplies but whatever had to be done was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">Well this is a Polish doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">He was a very fine man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">I had occasion to talk him on a few, a few times that I went over to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and of course many of the times when he came into my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to request medical supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">But he was dedicated and very happy to be able to be a surgeon, to be a doctor again, which he couldn’t do under the German thumb.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1462">QUESTION:  Do you recall his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1463">ANSWER:  No I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">No, I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">I probably have it somewhere, on a requisition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">I’d have to go through the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">I’m certain that there’s a name on the requisitions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">I have, I have a whole list of all the Polish personnel and also I have the emblem that they wore on their jackets that I’m gong to give to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">This is an interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">This gentleman had been a collaborationist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">Not in the sense that he collaborated with the Germans, although he might have, but we do know that whatever organization took over the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> , if he had been a member of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> he was able to ingratiate himself into the hierarchy of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the extent where he was able to get supplies and whatever the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">But he would also service himself by doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">He probably worked the black market in cigarettes, in candy, in clothing, in liquor and the DPs knew about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">When I became commander of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koburg</span> (ph), he started this same thing with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">And I was quite ignorant of what had gone before, and very innocent and he brought a beautiful dagger that he gave to me that he had sort of confiscated, I guess, himself and had belonged at one time to the Forestmeister of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> , near TreeAir (ph), <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">I still have that dagger but this gentleman is no longer with us because the night of the day that he gave me this souvenir, he was murdered by other members of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">Conclusion of Interview </span>
