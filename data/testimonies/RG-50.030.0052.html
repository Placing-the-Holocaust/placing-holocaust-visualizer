<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  You see, when I was 6 years old, then I started the <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Yet in...in 1918, we..we are very unhappy because of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And my father was convoked to the army as the officer because he was ordered the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and did then in the first year of...uh... the battle between German...German and Russian soldiers, he was taken into Russian captivity already in 1915 and he was there, which he knew Russian of course, so his conditions of life were not so difficult there. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And the...the Russians have esteemed him and used him rather for the more secretarial work, not handwork. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">In 1918, he benefited and profited by the...uh... disorder because of the Russian Revolution and the __. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">You see, just by his judgment he knew what to do and came to our family in 1918 and...uh...when <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> became independent, he also had to enter the Polish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">But after some months he came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and continued his business work. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">He was an exporter of food to greater <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , also to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , during the occupation of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> by Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And so our conditions of life were rather good and we had the opportunity to be developed really in the atmosphere of a loving family. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And when other members, my brothers and sisters heard about the my life's decision that I will go to priesthood, then they also sympathized with me and helped me really to reach that priesthood by their sympathy, by their prayers and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And so...and....uh...uh...in 1920, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naklo</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and...uh...there I was 2 years and then transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wadowice</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> of my society. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And...uh...1t was in the dioceses of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And...uh...then after I had finished the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I entered the <span class="BUILDING">preparatory school</span> for priesthood and...uh...
QUESTION:  What made you decide to go on and to enter the <span class="BUILDING">preparatory school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Why did you become a priest? </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Want to become a priest?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  You see there was in me some conviction that this is my way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It was not my decision, strictly speaking or theologically speaking, but some preparation from <span class="NPIP">above</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">You see, we do believe 1n...uh...in our faith that all the vocations of priesthood for religious life come from God himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And no doubt in order that this cause may mature, you may live a very dignified and religious also family. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">My parents were very faithful members of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">All my brothers and sisters too. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It was really the proper atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Also helping to deepen my conviction, there is my <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And did then after I finished philosophy, I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> to the ____ <span class="BUILDING">University</span> to study theology and...uh...to get a doctor degree in theology. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So...uh...27 I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> and for 4 years I studied there at the <span class="BUILDING">Gregorian university</span> and at 31, I received the Priestly ordination and also my doctoral degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ...back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> just to celebrate really my priesthood ordination in my...uh...parish where my family lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And then my professor who became Rector of Polish Catholic Mission in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , he came also for the celebration of my priesthood in my parish where he was a vicar and then invited me to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> just to help in his <span class="BUILDING">Secretariat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">My superiors have allowed, and I spent the first year of my priesthood 1n <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Then 32 came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and start...and taught...uh...the proper __ in <span class="BUILDING">minor college</span> and then in the superior classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">It was 4...uh...24. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Yes, that's nght. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">24 and 28, first in the first classes of <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> and then superior classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And in 1938...uh...the Primate of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , Archbishop of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poznan</span> who was also Director of the...uh...Polish Catholic Mission outside <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , he was asked by my former professor, Director of Polish Catholic mission, that my superiors may help...may really allow me to come again to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And...uh...1 was working for some time and...uh...then in 1938, my superior, former teacher of Latin, has resigned and the Primate has nominated me as superior of the Polish Catholic Mission, that is to say of the Pastoral care of all Poles in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And we had there are about 50 priests who worked for the Polish people only, and as a young Priest I became a Superior of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Traveling from <span class="NPIP">place</span> after <span class="NPIP">place</span> during summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">It was some days in which I remember some Polish parish has celebrated some feast and so I visited also in this way the territory of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And then ..then when the war came, _____ to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , 1939, we have really also suffered much. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And then...then suffered much because...especially because Germans...<span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> has occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And...uh... here really is my great, I would say, for for martyrdom because in...on October 26, 1940 ...uh...Gestapo came to the Polish Catholic Mission in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and told me, "Gentleman.” </span><span class="sentence" id="64">He didn't call me father. "</span><span class="sentence" id="65">We have in possession all of your sermons which you delivered to the French radio to the Polish people against our German system. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">You will not be free anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">This is the day that we make really the end to your freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">You come with us and we will place you in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="69">You see 26...26th of October 1940, I was arrested and placed then in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And then there I was...from October 26th to November 26th, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">That is to say, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , Parisian...<span class="BUILDING">Parisian prison</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Father, don't...don't worry about dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Truly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Tell...tell me why you had been arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">The Gestapo referred to radio programs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  You see...
QUESTION:  Tell me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  Because...because they collected my radio sermons and believed that I am great enemy of Nazis, and they have not tolerated...you see people also in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> who would say something against them, for the Nazis, for the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">You see their system was sacred. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Nobody had the right to offend them. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And then I always remained with the same conviction.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  What had you been saying on the radio?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Well, that Nazism, Hitlerism is not only an enemy of Jewish people, but they are also anti- Christian system. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">That is to say, not only a system to purify <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from Jewish population, but also to not ______ with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">It was impossible for them, but to take really under their influence the whole <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And then...so in my radio sermons, as I told you enlighten by the French government, I consoled the Polish people already occupied by Nazi Germany that Nazism really must collapse because it is not only anti-Jewish system, but anti-Christian and human system. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Everything what was for us dignified, you see, was just condemned by Nazis, rejected by Hitlerism. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And do not forget I told them that the whole world is not dependant of Nazis, but God 1s taking care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And so do not cooperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Do not get discouraged. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">You will suffer no doubt, but in your suffering you will find always our sympathy and the sympathy of the whole Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And because, you see, of this tax of this approach to Hitlerism I was not allowed to live as a free person. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">So they considered me as an Enemy No. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">1. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> after 1 month of being 1n <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , I was just transferred...transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and on my way to ____ 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I was few days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trier</span> , ____, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> , and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> on December the 10, 1940...1940 to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , __. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And really that___——~———_—satn <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was a place of torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And...uh...you see no freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Just closed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> and...uh...I was really free only 2 times a month to take some part in the ___ of all the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Twice a month I was able to leave the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Otherwise, <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> was my unique, only <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">But in...uh...the week which we called Holy Week, I was really taken into the <span class="INT_SPACE">black cell</span> , that is to say without a light, without a light, without water, without anything, and there was a left there for 6 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">That is to say, imagine only you have no possibility to look through the <span class="DLF">window</span> because everything was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">You didn't have any possibility to take water or some...take some food because they didn't bring it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">After this Holy Week, I was really exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">But this was not sufficient for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">You see, they...I suppose they tried just to kill me, and they came at the end and felt...treated me so cruelly that I was fully exhausted and perhaps it seemed to them that I am not living any more, but to be sure they took me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where conditions were certainly not easy but better than the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So after some days I have recuperated and then they have taken me back to the ____—_. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But with more normal conditions of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">That is to say, I have received the regular food as other prisoners, but only with the privilege to leave for the Priminate twice a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And from ____ I was from December 10, 40. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">On July 29, 41, I left Berlin____-———S—S—S—S—s arn then transferred to the camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And then I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachenhausen</span> on July 29th, 41, and was there to February the 3rd, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And there I was also...uh...well, what I say, exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">You see because the conditions in the camp of concentration are not easy or were not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Neither here nor there. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And so after 3 weeks in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , I was for them fit to be transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Let's stop a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">If you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I want to put this down. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Can we stop and pause the tape a moment please. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Uh...Steven, are you there? </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Can you...we're having sawing or hammering of some kind coming through. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Would you please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Okay, Father we are back on camera. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">You had wanted to tell us the dates of where you were on each <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  But I have already told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> I was from July 29, 41 to February, the 3rd, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And then I was transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> to the prisons of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kothen</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg._And</span> on February the 13th, 1942, I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And...uh...finally, we shall speak about it later, on Sunday, April 29, 1945, we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> , you see, the conditions were not as cruel as in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And I spent there some time just...uh...doing things as other prisoners and particularly taking care of cleaning the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Deprived of any liberty! </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And then...then, of course, I was not beaten there as the other prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And so I still was able to continue my life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , it was really not easy to live and to survive because as the renowned French politician ___ wrote in his book, he was also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , and in his book, ___ Liberate Root of Liberty, he says in that book that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> for him was an organized <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And you see if somebody very intelligent person really writes so that not only for him, but for all the people, it was really life in <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> , without any hope, without peace, without liberty. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">You have been considered just there as a mechanical instrument, moved here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And...uh...1n my case as the Polish priest, also, we had to work everyday in this so called plantation. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And the...the work was really not easy and then every day, every day the same work. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And without enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And then with the spirit of persecution you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">All those Gestapo people who really tried to direct our work, we our not human and..uh.. although...although they were very...uh...I would say... uh...against all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Yet we tried to avoid their discipline you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And we did when they have...when they have...uh...come to us, we tried to do our best. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">When they disappeared, we just relaxed. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And so they didn't have the true judgment of our work, but when they have seen that we really were not working what they have beaten us. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And you see, some Gestapo people were very cruel without any sense of justice and the mocked kindness. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And many people beaten, and the plantation had to be transferred to the so-called <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And there the Gestapo men finished them. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">You see, there was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I was there also for...uh...some days just to heal my wounds here on the legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And...uh...we didn't have the true conditions which a sick person should have in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">You see, they treated us just as some living instrument and moved us here and there, also without the proper food. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But in those conditions, it was really very important to have a firm will and peace of heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">How was it possible to find peace of heart in such conditions? </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And I answered just by your faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">You see, if you believed in God, 1n his not only justice, but also Law, then you knew that you are under his protection and if he permits all that suffering to us, it 1s also on the basis that we, the mortal priest, are co-responsible for the salvation of the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And you cannot be safe according to our gospel, but taking also part in some suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">St. Paul in his Epistles tells us that our Lord has suffered for us and they offered to God that suffering, but in order that the suffering may be a stripe to us, we had to complete also that suffering by giving our part. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And so if you have such faith that your suffering really can bring some fruit to you, to your brethren, then you have found also energy and strength to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And...uh...we say very often that suffering can break or make you. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">It can break you if you see nonsense in the suffering, but if you find out that there is some value also of suffering and because of this in the popular language, we say that it can make you...it can make you stronger. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The more so stronger if you are a believer. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">If you think that everything 1s under the divine control. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And in this faith and tn this spirit you can really energize also your body and bring more peace for your daily life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  How did that help you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="170">What was in...in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , how did your faith help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">What...what kind of things did you do in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  You see, it was really...very great danger to lose faith in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">If your faith was not firm. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Because the German Bishop have received from Himmler the privilege that he has also given to the German priest a <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> , and they had the possibility to have their prayers, devotions, masses, and so on, but under one condition: no one accept German priests were allowed to take part all of the devotions performed in the <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But here the danger for some people...you see some people really intended, not only priests but lay people, intended to go to the <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> and pray a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">But there was a custodian, the priest, who according to the order of Gestapo was not allowed to...any body to enter a <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And so the lay people said, "Well, how can I believe if this minister of God 1s so cruel just not to allow me to go to the <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> for a spiritual comfort? </span><span class="sentence" id="179">and obeys rather a Gestapo order and not God's way. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We have to answer, "There are also ____ people among the priest who act not according to their conscious, but according to the order received from the civil authority.” </span><span class="sentence" id="181">But in order to replace for our use <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> here and there when we were not specially...specially controlled by Gestapo, we formed really little group of people, and consoled each other and prayed with each other and so some little common utarian groups have been formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And also it was...uh..for us also a joy when some priest custodian, not allowing according to the order of Gestapo enter the <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> to...not German priest, that he has just closed his eyes and allowed us to enter. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And then so from time to time it was also for us a spiritual consolation to pray and this <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> was reserved only for German priests and...uh...well some priests were so friendly to us that they also brought to us some part of the Holy whole. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">You know what it means? </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And so we were...uh...also not only consoled by strength you see, by this sacramental help and assistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So you must say that the German priests tried to help us also, but too many were fearful and fearful...and...for example, to such an extent, that they say, "No, I will not do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I cannot.” </span><span class="sentence" id="189">When I was really in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> after this torture of the Holy Week then some men who took care of us sick people...uh...he, knowing that I am priest, said, "Well, 1f you so wish I can prepare for you perhaps the possibility to say Mass.” And I said, "I would be so grateful to you, but you must ask the priest, the chaplain to give you all the instruments and say...for saying Mass. I approached the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , say Father and told him, "Father," I have all the opportunities for saying Mass here without being controlled by anybody in some secret <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Will you be so kind and give me everything that is necessary for celebrating.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And he said, "Father, I am too afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Do you think that I should expose myself to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="193">Never mind.” </span><span class="sentence" id="194">You see, we had also such sadness, such opportunities that on the one hand you had the possibility to be strengthened spiritually. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">On the other hand, fearful people who could help you and that chaplain was really...I would say very cranky even. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">He feared too much the Gestapo, and even <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">If really somebody is 1n the need spiritual...spiritual need I should help him, also if I will be exposed to some suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">We all are members of one family. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And members which should help one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And so this spirit you see of common utarian sympathy assistance was lacking also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , but as a rule we must say that all the priests except those that were in the <span class="DLF">German block</span> for priests...uh...with some exception of course...all other priests tried to help each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And...uh...so in this case, we can also understand why we have survived being helped, assisted by others, although not materially but spiritually. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">By this assistance, we really received new energy for survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So then after many months...you see, at the end of 1944, we have received the privilege to receive packages from our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And then really we have received many packages our families. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They tried to do their best in order to send us packages with the necessary...uh...food in order to strengthen us. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And as a rule, Gestapo has allowed us to accept to receive all the packages and so from October 1944 til the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> on Sunday, 29th, we really became stronger people. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And we may say prepared for liberty not to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> even to <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> or to some other <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So packages sent us by our parents really were a great blessing for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And one thing, we priests, Polish priests, noticed that packages sent by our Mothers came intact without corruption. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And then from other members of families, here and there there was food and damage by this or other conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And so one idea came to a priest and he composed a beautiful song in honor of our mothers and we sang, you see, this song, really giving not only our thanks but expressing our deepest affection to our mothers to our family also, but especially to our mothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And so we, on this occasion, started also our psychology, and came to conclusion that really love for a mother is the deepest mother besides the love for a God. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And then also this renewal I would say of that...uh...uh...love for our mother, with the food, really made us more normal people. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And...uh.. when I was also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> in...uh...1n the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for some days, one priest was dying and called, "Mother," in such despair. "</span><span class="sentence" id="215">My dearest Mother.” </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I approached him and told him, "Father, be consoled. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">You will find the blessed mother in <span class="NPIP">Heaven</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And he said, "Father, do you understand the deep love of a dying person fora mother?" </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And I said, "Well, I was not in this state of dying yet, but I understand that Mother really counts as the great consolation in the last moment of life.” </span><span class="sentence" id="220">You see, we perhaps have not realized enough what great really strength is our love for a mother, and the love of Mother for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Mother lives for her children. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Not always children live for their mothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">But our suffering, for example, in this case in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> really renewed in us the worthiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">There is no greater love after our love for God, than the love for our mother which is not always developed, but different occasions can really develop to such an extent that it will become strength and renewed energy for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">So then came the blessed day of...uh...April 29.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  Can we hold it a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I would like not to get to the liberation yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I would like to go back for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">QUESTION:  You have mentioned being in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Could you tell us about the events that led up to your being in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and you told me an extraordinary story before. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Tell us about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  You see, when we speak of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> or in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> then we should not believe that the name of <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was identical with the conditions of a civilized <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">You were there only an instrument...uh...which really received here...here and there some care, but most minimal. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">When you came to <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , then all the people who took care of the sick people believed you came here to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And so if you didn't have the interior strength and the...the hope to survive, the little food which you have received was not able to help you to survive that. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And so many people really died there and how many? </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Well, for example, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> 868 Polish priests perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Eight hundred sixty eight, and 3 of them...200 of them in the medical experiments, by torture in the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> __. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And the Polish clergy <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> order no. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">clergy of ordination, we were 1,718 numbers....1,718. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And as I already told you, 868 were...died, and was martyred, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And...uh...then we must say that the...uh...priests slowly...at the end of 1944 received really some better conditions of life to such an extent that they have received also a permission that a French Bishop who was there also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> has ordained a gentleman deacon to the priesthood. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">You see, unheard...
QUESTION:  Did you see the ordination?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  Yes, I...we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Please. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Put...put that down.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  And it was Karla Lisner, Deacon Karl Lisner. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">He was ordained by the French Bishop.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  Tell us about that ordination as you saw it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">ANSWER:  Well, for us it was great day not only because we witnessed the ordination of that Karl Lisner, but because we really....uh...have...have experienced some spiritual atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">You see, when you are deprived of any spiritual assistance and help and ordinary conditions of human dignified life, when you take part in such a great ceremony then you are liberated really and strengthened. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And perhaps in our materialistic times, we do not realize...uh...what kind of help and assistance we are losing, becoming indifferent to all the religious exercises and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">In that...in that...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> when, for example, such occasions happened that we had the possibility to assist during the Mass or before the Moment in the <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> or in this case, to be witnesses of the ordination. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Oh, this was really a day of great spiritual elevation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">QUESTION:  The Germans permitted this ordination?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">ANSWER:  You see, it was already...already 1944, as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">He was ordained...ordained by the bishop in December 44, and from October 1944, we had already better conditions because of food we have received from our families. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So this 1s the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  You had started...we sort of got off the <span class="DLF">track</span> a little bit to tell about your experience in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">How did you come to be in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  You see, because work in...1n the <span class="DLF">plantation</span> , I collapsed out of exhaustion. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And so I was unable to walk, to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So the so-called Kapo, you see of that group of people in which I also worked, ordered some people to bring some...uh...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that I may be transferred to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And so I suppose that the reason, the only reason was the exhaustion. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And...uh...I didn't...didn't get much medical help, but I had the possibility to relax, to be free from the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And did then also after some days, the possibility to approach the other prisoners also sick and console and strengthen them. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And so in some case, it was not only a blessing for me to be there in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> but also for those who needed also some advice, some help, some encouragement and so on because many sick people out of exhaustion, of being deprived of any assistance, help and encouragement died. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Or if they didn't die, they die yet, then they were more murdered and burned in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  You had said also you were in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> another time for your legs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">That's right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  Could you tell us about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  Uh...This was just only some hour in which I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">There had seen what happened and given me some...uh...I would say means to stop the blood and so on and to cover all the wounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I was there really for some hours to get some help, some assistance, but you see if you...if you did then have some inner strength and I would say...uh...desire to survive and to overcome all sufferings...also the very little sickness would you suffer, brought you to <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">You see when you speak of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , then you just cannot think of normal conditions of human life. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">The more so of the proper conditions in the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">They had to reopen also <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> you see because well the human eye needed it and international opinion also. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So many, so many, I would say, people knew about all these things and conditions in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , then they just try also to visit or show here we also <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> we care of the sick people, but the visitors didn't have any possibility to talk with us, to speak to us, to ask how do you feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And on the day if some visit was...uh...really programmed in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , then they have prepared better food, for the eyes you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">But really inhuman conditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">QUESTION:  Tell us about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Were you...uh...ever beaten and tortured in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  You see, not tortured but perhaps not taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">This was the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And so, for example, if...1f I was weak because of exhaustion, then they have not tortured me there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Perhaps because I was priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">But they didn't assist me. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">You had to just take care of yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And other people if they really were sick, they became victims of torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Many, many people really just disappeared because the Gestapo inflicted such great and did suffering to them that they had to finish their life. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So conditions which were not human you see, and because of this you can understand why the many also writers, as [have quoted____, the French writer, why they have spoken of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> as of the organized <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And many people really died and tortured in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I told you about, for example, Polish priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">We were there 1,718 and 868 perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">That is to say, died. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And...uh...300 of them..uh..died because of tortured suffered in the medical experiments. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">The doctors tried to see what they can expect from...from...uh..., for example, if the tortured such person to such an extent or another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">You see, we are experimental people. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And...uh...we must say that... uh...the German priest were rather more protected than we, the priest of other nationalities and the more so lay people. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">But some people knew how to organize also their lives and survive in better conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">This is the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And so then came the day of liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  At this point, we pause. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We need to pause here and we will change tapes and then we will talk about liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">TAPE #2
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Let us go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">If you would put that down. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I would like to ask you now that the tape is on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  The questions I asked I asked you when the tape was off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Yal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  Uh...Could you tell me first, please, how you went about...uh...saying confession in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER:  You see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">You're on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  We heard confession just by walking with some person who asked us for this privilege or we were hidden in some corner of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> because to hear confessions...you see it was really for the Gestapo some cause of a torture, and we tried to help the people that really in such way that these are ____ became the victims of torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And, also, during the work when we were not controlled by Gestapo, some people came to us and...uh...working a little, we have heard their confession and of course, tried to help them, strengthen them, to deepen their faith, confidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And then, you see, one thing that you can communicate with another person and share, things which are great interest for you is most helpful, particularly in such conditions in which we lived in...11 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And...uh...because of this we must say and repeat again that suffering can break, but also make you. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Through suffering you can benefit so much that you can have an idea of it only after you finish your way of the cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And...uh...this is really so that we may open our eyes more fully to the mysteries of our life, to the mysteries of our destiny, and then in our Christian life to complete what 1s wrong thing of the suffering of Christ for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">YOu see, Christ, according to our faith, has paid the majority of the price for the ticket to <span class="NPIP">Heaven</span> , but on the condition that we also give our part that the price may be made fuller. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">If we are not interested in it, then the precious suffering of Christ for us, for you, for...a person 1s lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , how did you help comfort people? </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Was this legal and open in the daytime or did you have to do it illegally and secretly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">ANSWER:  Uh...Secretly. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">It was not allowed legally to bring to the people some religious comfort. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">You see, Nazi's most really diabolical system, trying to finish with faith, with religion and annilihate, everything what was not Hitlerism. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">It's a totalarian system, and then anti-Christian among the religious and no doubt that the Jewish people suffered really many losses but it was also and so because for Hitler, Judaism was a religion and then after finishing Judaism, they would like to finish Christianity. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">But they didn't have the possibility of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">You see there was a diabolical system.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">QUESTION:  How did you go about trying to bring comfort? </span><span class="sentence" id="338">What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">ANSWER:  Well, you see, first of all, then we have offered to them a promise to help if we can and this are another case because they came to also with some difficulties in their work, in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  The other prisoners you mean?</span></p>

"</span><span class="sentence" id="431">I do not acknowledge the communistic government and the Consul General who...uh...calls himself Polish General Consul, is for me not any representative of Polish government because this Polish government is fully and entirely strange to our Polish...uh...people. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And I will never allow to...the communists to infiltrate our Polish ranks.” </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And he said, "Well, you are responsible for your conditions of life, but try only not to offend them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And I said, "Well, the...these communists personally will never be offended by me in my conversation, in my repression, and so on.” </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And I told the ___ delegate, "If the communistic consul general comes to our <span class="BUILDING">church</span> ...uh...to the <span class="BUILDING">Polish church</span> , I will accept him really as the faith will. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I will also hear his confession. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And so be sure that in the matter of religion, those communists will not be persecuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">If they would like to become really faithful to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , they will have all the opportunities barred to bring the communistic poison to our Polish ranks will be excluded, but you see when the communistic ambassador didn't succeed to pacify me, going to the French government, and then...uh...to the upper story...to delegate, they went to the Provincial Superior of my Province in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And they said, "If you do not dismiss Father Cegielka from the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of the Superior of Polish Catholic Mission, we will close your <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And the Provincial answered, "He is not subject to me in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">He was nominated by the Cardinal ____, the Prime of the <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And so I have no power. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I cannot do anything.” </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And so the communists have understood that he cannot do anything and cannot just send me away from my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">So they went to the General and said, "If you do not dismiss this man from the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , that will be end of...uh...many priests in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And so the General...the General
