<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  So, I'm Arwen Donahue and we're here at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and it's November 17, 1995. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">I'm here with Mr. Nicholas Winton. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">And Mr. Winton if you would state for me your date of birth and place of birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born on the 19th of May 1909 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And will you say something for me about your family background, what your father did, and your mother, and what you rememberâ€™?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  My father was a banker, Mother was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and was the first girl in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to take the Ivy tour which is the matriculation when that exam became open for girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> after her marriage when she was very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">She was still 17.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  What was the atmosphere in your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> like in your early years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  It was very... it was marvelous. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">We were in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> which Father's parents had owned previously. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">It was an enormous <span class="BUILDING">20 room house</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">billiard table</span> in I remember, and yes we were happy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">It was in the north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hampstead</span> and Father moved from banking after the war to importing glass from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He joined a firm which imported glass. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Yes, it was very as far as I can remember, a congenial atmosphere. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Nearly 85 years ago now, so I don't know how much one genuinely remembers from one's childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Now, you traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when you were fairly young, did you not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Well, we traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on holiday because Mother's relatives were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Mother's mother was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and brothers and sisters were still over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And of course when Hitler arrived on the scene, so the family that had been still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> started to come over to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and of course Mother and Father were able to help them not only to come over but to...to look after them. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">They all stayed with us to start with before making their separate ways in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  How would you describe.... were you aware of Hitler from the beginning of his rise to power, and did you know anything about him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  I think we did, because when Hitler came to power in 1933 I was 24 and I... from my youth I think I've always been very politically conscious and always very left wing and I joined all kinds of things which would have been protesting against things like Hitler represented. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Yes, I think we were very aware of it from early on, especially having gone through the first world war also where you had that... not anti-semitic feeling, but certainly anti-German feeling in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Later on, one had not only the anti-semitic but the anti-German feeling together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  When you were... before you become a London stock broker, correct me if I'm wrong, you had traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to study banking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Well, Father, as I said, had been a banker, and he thought that my career should be in banking, and that a little travel would do me good, and I was in a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> for a year and then six months with a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and then six months for the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and I would have gone on to do banking over here in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> were it not for the big crash occurring in '29, and so Father thought it was about time I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , instead of him spending money on me, and some of my own.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Were you interested in banking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  Yes, I think I was interested in banking and finance, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I dare say I would have accomodated myself to any other profession I'd be put in, but banking seemed to suit me quite well, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  What are your recollections from those months that you spent in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , political recollections? </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Did you witness persecution?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  When I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which would have been in 1930, I have no political recollections at all really. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I mean I did banking, I made a lot of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I was good at fencing and I was both in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">local fencing club</span> , and met a lot of friends there-- and in fact I even fenced for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">At that time in 1930, there was a big match against <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I was on their team and I also owned a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Wansee</span> and spent the weekends boating. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So at that time there was no -- I mean I wasn't interested in politics as such at that time and it was of course prior to... 1t was three years before Hitler even came on the scenes. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So, no I wasn't in any way politically interested at that period.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  When would you say that your political awareness was focused?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Well, I mean in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I was always politically aware of politics, but local politics, British politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And it was really only slowly, after 1933, when the implications of what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were known, that I became kind of interested in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Because, as I say, I was always very interested 1n politics, and my friends were always very interested in politics, and we were all pretty well left-wing and we used to have meetings and discuss things so that really directly Hitler became a factor in European life. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Yes, we were very interested in that, very. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We became more so as he became more aggressive and took over more of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Can you describe your friendship with Martin Blake?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Well, Martin Blake had always been a friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">He was a master at <span class="BUILDING">Westminster School</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and he and I shared lots of interests, but chiefly political interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We also liked winter sports, and he took a party of children to winter sports every year in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and I accompanied him which had the advantage of, for very little trouble or expense of energy, we got a free holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And, we were very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We were always together and nearly always with other people who were discussing politics in some way or other reasonably left wing politics because there was a lot going on at that time as Hitler became more and more influential in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Do you remember any of your discussions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  Well, not in detail really no. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They were anti- Hitler, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I can't remember the details. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">The politics in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> at that time were so complicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">You had the people who were very frightened about the rise in Hitler, and yet one of the biggest left-wing movements was the Peace Pledge Union which in a way was contrary to what was going on in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So, it was a very curious period, which was highlighted later on, of course, by the way Chamberlain and other people dealt with the rise of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They were also very schizophrenic about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">They didn't really know how... how to handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They still thought that... that this idea of peace could be maintained and... Very difficult to discuss the feeling in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> at that time, because there were of course a lot of people like there were in every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , because of the rise, just because of the rise of left wing influence who were becoming more and more right wing. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So, there were crowds of people in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> who at that time were very right-wing, as epitomized by Oswald Mosely and his people, whom I actually knew quite well at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">He was in our fencing club, Sir Oswald Mosely. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">He seemed quite inoffensive when he was fencing but he commanded quite a political clout later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Did you have particular ideas after the rise of Hitler of what should be done, what you wanted to do or that you felt you should do something in response?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Well, I think in a democracy the individual always feels rather powerless, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">You could feel it and talk about it and discuss it but except voting for a government there was nothing one could really do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">My political awareness of Hitler really was only crystallized when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and really saw for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">One could see individually what was happening from time to time but there was little one could do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I mean, one is very powerless really, the individual in a democracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And yes, we discussed it and we discussed the dangers of it, at the same time as this peace pledge movement was going on, so it was very curious situation at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">But there were lots of people in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> who weren't that much frightened by Hitler at the time, you know, who felt that the danger wasn't Hitler at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">The danger was <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And a great many people at that time I don't think ever thought that we would really be in conflict with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because they thought that the politicians would be adept enough to see that the Germans fought <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and not us. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">In the event, of course, they fought both, but not in the order we expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Now, Martin Blake, at this time, was working with refugees, was he not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  No, no, Martin Blake really had nothing to do with refugees at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Martin Blake knew a lot of people politically as well as of course his work for the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and he was very friendly with one lady Doreen Wariner who was the representative for the British Committee for <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and was given the job of going out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and heading a movement to try and save those who had arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and were politically endangered since the Germans... when the Germans... if the Germans arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">That was of course after the... Hitler marched in <span class="REGION">Sudetenland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And he rung me up one day just before he was setting off for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and said, "Look, I've cancelled my trip to winter sports so yours is cancelled too. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I'm in a rush-- I can't tell you what's going on but meet me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and I'll tell you," and that's how I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I really didn't know what I was in for when I left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  When was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  When was that? </span><span class="sentence" id="85">That was Christmas '38, '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I don't know the actual dates anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">That was Christmas '38, '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And I went out and met him, Blake, one evening, I knocked him up at the <span class="BUILDING">hotel Sroubek</span> and he told me what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  What did he tell you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  Well he told me that there was all these people who had come into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> mostly after the Germans marched into <span class="REGION">Sudetenland</span> , and that they were the Jews, they were the writers, they were those who were on Hitler's blacklist, and I think there were five separate groups, all of whom were endangered, and the job of Doreen Wariner and the British Committee was to try and rescue them and get them out to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And at that time, of course, they were... a lot of the people were living with friends or relatives whom they knew in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> but a lot of them were already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And I went â€˜round the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to see what was going on, together with actually two ladies who were given into my custody to look after whilst I did these tours, and one was Eleanor Rathbone, the member of parliament, and the other was the Reverend Rosalind Lee, who was the head of the <span class="BUILDING">Unitarian church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And we toured 'round these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in the dead of winter and snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">It was all rather cold and pathetic to see what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And I suppose that's when my final... when more of my ideas about really what was going on in the continent were formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  Were these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> all located near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  The ones we saw were located near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I remember we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> but whether we hired a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> or whether we were moved around I really can't remember but they were, yes, in the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They were Nissenhunt (ph) camps, and very over-crowded, and very nasty <span class="NPIP">places</span> for continuous living.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  Do you remember what you saw there, anything in particular stand out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  What, at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  No, I can't remember except that on my way out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> I met a gentleman called Mr. Hails who said he was out there to do business. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">He was in the motorbike business... I think he was going to buy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorbikes</span> , and I said that he couldn't really know what as going on in Europe if he thought he could buy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorbikes</span> at this particular time in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and he said, "Well what are you doing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="105">and I said, "I really don't know at the moment, but this will be my address, and if you've got time come and visit me." </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And he visited me the second day I was there and I took him â€˜round the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And in talking to him actually I found out that he was the Mr. Hails who instigated the Atlantic Blue Ribbon for the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> , so he must have been in that kind of business. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And going round the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , he suddenly disappeared, and I went back to look for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He was on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> crying his eyes out. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">He was not knowing what he was going to be 1n for; he hadn't really expected that I would take him into that kind of situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  So, would you say that most people weren't aware that these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> existed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  I shouldn't think in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> that anybody was aware of it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I don't really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I should think a lot of people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> must have known about it, yes, but whether it was known in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I mean, we were... obviously everybody knew that the Germans marched into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sudetenland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Everybody in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> said, you know, "This is Hitler's last ambition, and he's not going to do any more." </span><span class="sentence" id="117">When I was over there and found out that in marching into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sudetenland</span> not only meant that they were marching into that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> which was chiefly inhabited by Germans, but all their defenses were in that <span class="DLF">line</span> too, so from that moment on <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> was pretty defenseless in any case. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And of course <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> was full of Germans already. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We were followed 'round the whole time by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So one could see what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I wrote <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and said, "Look, this is happening," they either didn't want to or didn't believe that what we were actually seeing there meant what we were perfectly certain that it meant: that the Germans were on their way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Where were you staying?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  I stayed at the <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Sroubek</span> which we stayed at when we were over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> four or five years ago, when we were... I got the Freedom of Prague and met Havel and had lunch with Dubcek. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">It was all very exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We stayed at the same <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that I had been at in 1939, right in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">central Prague</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  And was Martin Blake staying with you there as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  No, he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I think he was already dead --
QUESTION:  No, at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">In '38.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  He was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sroubek</span> , yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  Now, will you describe to me how you became aware that you were going to be working on this issue of refugees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and how you came to that decision?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Well, as I said I went round the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and I was told of the people whom the British Committee were trying to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And every day I met up with Doreen Warriner to discuss what was going on and we usually met at one of the big <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Alcron</span> , and discussed what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Usually there were one or two men sitting not far away, and she had to say to me in German, "Until that gentleman disappears we better discuss the weather." </span><span class="sentence" id="135">You could be as rude as you'd like to the Germans as English people at that time, because we certainly didn't, and I mean, they certainly, I don't think, at that time ever thought they were going to be at war with <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And we of course hoped they wouldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And in conversation she said, "There are all these children, you know, who should be got out, but the British Committee just can't do anything about it at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They're far too overworked with the business of trying to get out the political refugees, the writers and all those people endangered," and said to me, "Look, if anything can be done, perhaps you'd like to try and do it," and that's really how it started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Were you aware at that point that <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> had made the decision to let in a certain number of children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  No, I hadn't got a clue. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I found a gentleman who came out from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , Trevor Chadwick, who said that if it was possible to bring children out, he'd given up his job as teaching in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swannage</span> (ph), he'd run the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And I said, "Well, I've not got a clue whether you can bring children into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , but stay there, and I'll go back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and find out if anything can be done." </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And so, I mean, when I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> nobody had any idea that anything would really transpire. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">In the end it didn't prove very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The <span class="BUILDING">Home Office</span> said, "Under certain conditions," which they laid down, "you can bring in as many children as you like." </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So, the <span class="BUILDING">Home Office</span> made no difficulties at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Getting children into other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> was more difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We got a few children into <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> whilst I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , but later on I don't know if that movement continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">But we didn't bring out children to anywhere else except into <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We tried to get children into <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> but that wasn't possible at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  How did you try to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Well I have letters with a lot of the important people in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> at that time and they all gave excuses -- no it's not fair to say excuses -- they gave reasons why they couldn't allow children to be brought into <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> at that time, which makes pretty sad reading when you read these letters at the present day. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But still, that was... I mean bringing over 600 children was something I suppose, but many more could have been brought over had we... had we had more time as well, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I don't think a lot of people realized the urgency which we felt was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Having been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , one could almost feel that it was any time the Germans could march in. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , of course, that urgency wasn't there at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  And you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for three weeks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> about a fortnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">That was as long as my holiday allowed, and even then I was getting letters: Why did I want to spend time in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> when I should come back and make money for my firm on the <span class="BUILDING">stock exchange</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="160">There was no-- certainly not in the city-- there was no real feeling of either urgency or things should be done, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">It was rather the, generally the Chamberlain attitude, you know: putting oneself out for a little <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> far away with which we had no genuine obligations. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">The major factor of Hitler versus Europe wasn't really in people's minds at that time, despite what Hitler had done up to then. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And I think there were lots of people who would have obviously far preferred to maneuver Hitler to fight against <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> first than for us to take up the cudgels. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">After all, there had been plenty of time for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the West to take up against Hitler, but before then there was plenty of occasions, as he had been nibbling away at various parts of Europe, that we could say, "Enough, and no further." </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I mean, by the time we took a stand on the Polish issue most of Europe had been already absorbed, or a lot of 1t anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So, I suppose historians will be writing about that for a long time: whether or not it could have been done differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I don't think that people, certainly in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , realized the danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">They always thought they could negotiate with Hitler, that in a way he was a smaller menace than what was happening elsewhere in the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  What was the date... do you remember the first... How did you get the first transport out of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  Well, I was only then, when I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I was working on the <span class="BUILDING">stock exchange</span> , which luckily was a job which finished at 3:30 in the afternoon so I could go back and carry on trying to... to make arrangements for bringing children over. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And as I say, the British Committee for Refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> didn't give me... weren't able to give me either <span class="INT_SPACE">office space</span> or any help whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And I just had note paper printed with their name on it, and put under, "Children's Section," worked from my <span class="BUILDING">private home</span> up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hampstead</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And the Reverend Rosalind Lee whom I mentioned, sent me the first 100 pounds to pay for correspondence and everything and we got newspapers like Picture Post to write articles saying that we were looking for guarantors and that we were looking for <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where these children would be looked after until the end of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And this started to trickle in, and, as we got people who would take children, so we sent them lists of children and even photos of children, and got them to choose children, and we then sent these out to Trevor Chadwick in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , who then arranged for the transport and the getting the children together, whilst we arranged for the people who were receiving the children to arrive at <span class="BUILDING">Liverpool Street Station</span> to receive them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Can we go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> for just a little while and will you tell me about how you started the operation going, you came to the realization that the children needed help and then what did you do? (</span><span class="sentence" id="176">End of tape 1, side A)
QUESTION:  When you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , the end of 1938 and the beginning of 1939 what did you do after you realized that the children needed help in escaping Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  Once I told Doreen Warriner that if it were possible to do it I would try and do it and knowing that when I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I would have to go back to work, the thing was to arrange the set up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> which could go into operation should I be successful when I got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">The person who was in charge -- I put in charge then was Trevor Chadwick but there was a Mr. Barozetti who was secretary to Doreen Warriner and he kind of ran the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in which Trevor Chadwick had <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">The first job of course was as I said there were five committees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> at that time, was to get one central list. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I mean you can't work from five lists and try to pick out who are the most important people or the most urgent cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">They were very diffident of course to give up their lists and having such a very short time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> I had to use kind of black mail tactics bringing up eventually I think it was the communist committee saying that I had one list on which I would work and the others could join if they wanted to, otherwise none of the lists would be considered. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So within a couple of days we got a joint list and we discussed at that time how the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> would have to work if I could be successful in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So, it was all a bit hairy fairy and nebulous and it may happen and it may not. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">But there was an awful lot to be done in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> if it did come off. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">They'd have to get all these children together. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">They'd have to get exit permits from the -- well, when I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> of course it wasn't the German authority because the Germans only arrived in March, but the time we really got going the Germans were in charge because they arrived in March 1939 and then of course they had to get exit permits from the Germans for these children to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">They then had to arrive with to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and then they had to arrange for escorts to go with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">They then had to find out from how much the operation would cost and we had to send out money eventually to cover that cost which should have been used black mail tactics and two days before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was due to leave they'd say they want another thousand pounds or something which was a lot of money in those days which once you got all the children moving to a <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and once you got all the people who are going to receive the children in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> posted that they had to be at <span class="BUILDING">Liverpool Street Station</span> at a certain time, it's not an operation that you could cancel. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Whatever they'd ask for somehow or another we would have had to produce. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But there was a lot of work to be done in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and it was done very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">The work we had to do in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was to find to meet the conditions which the <span class="BUILDING">home office</span> had laid down which was having a guarantor 50 pounds for each person which they designated as being money which would be used for the children's eventual repatriation at the end of the war, of course there wasn't a war to start with. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Then we slowly got people coming in saying yes they would take a child and that accelerated when a lady came to me who had been working for the British committee and brought me all the names of their correspondence throughout the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> so I was able to use that with an appeal for children, which of course always brings results whether it's for handicapped children, lame children, or blind children. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">For children and animals, the two most easiest things to get sympathy and raise money. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So, it went slowly but it did work. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We never got obviously as many guarantors as we wanted but we didn't have an awful lot of time to work on them and when we got the guarantee for a reasonable number of people we'd do the paper work and send it out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> then had all the job of arranging the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and the escorts and the money and dealing with all the parents and getting the children onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">It was quite an operation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">QUESTION:  When you're compiling lists of the children, did all five committees end up cooperating?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">ANSWER:  Well, as I say, we told each individual committee eventually that we can't work with five lists, and before I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> they had agreed to coordinate and make one list and I think there was already one list before I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So, the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> did work on that one list. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Obviously it wasn't only people who were on that list who came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I mean there were people very likely who weren't on the list who heard of this operation going on and wanted to send their children away. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I mean, how can you tell which are really the most urgent. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I mean I suppose any Jewish child at that time was the most urgent politically of course, it was more difficult to decide and that one had to rely on the committees to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">QUESTION:  Were you present when the decisions were being made and were you involved in the decision making process?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">ANSWER:  I was only concerned with the decision making process in the end product of where the children were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I mean I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> so I couldn't in any way influence who came. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">That was decided in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> by Trevor Chadwick and with the aid of other people who were working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I suppose the records which I've got here that 92 percent of the children were Jewish so that 8 percent were either on Hitler's blacklist or were communists or were writers or were children of that type who were in danger, and I think we've hardly made any of them who ever saw their parents or relatives again. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Very few, very, very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So, I suppose that in itself shows -- I mean whatever Jew that was brought out was the right Jew wasn't it. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">They were all in danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  While you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , did you interview any parents, children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">ANSWER:  I was usually had people in my <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> whilst I was shaving in the morning and usually followed until I put my head on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But there's very little I can remember about that now, but yes, certainly people the whole time were trying to influence you and leaving crates of pilsner beer behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Well, you can imagine they tried to use what influence they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I don't think we really, to be quite honest, took any notice of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">You couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">You have to be very tough in charitable work. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Feel soft hearted in charitable work it becomes impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">You really got to treat it as a business and we had these lists and we went by them. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">It's very likely that some people threw influence from knowing people or in some way or another got on the list ahead of other people who were just as deserving, but it was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">You can't sort it out like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">The same as in social services today isn't it. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Lot's of people get on the lists that shouldn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  When you returned to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> you were working as a stockbroker by day and working out of your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  Did you feel that you were living two lives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  It's only difficult to ask me how I felt 50 odd years ago, but no I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I mean I just left one <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and did the other work. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">It didn't seem strange to me at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I had the police corp on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I remember asking why I had that enormous correspondence with <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> from a private <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but I think I was far too busy to entertain those kinds of thoughts at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">It was two different lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I mean people mostly on the <span class="BUILDING">stock exchange</span> or a lot of people on the <span class="BUILDING">stock exchange</span> I didn't talk to about what I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I mean nearly all of them or most of them had completely different political views and opinions to mine so there was really no point in discussing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">They couldn't help in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">At least some of them whom I was more friendly with very likely gave me some money for the running of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , but I can't really remember those details any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">You see this story didn't exist for 50 years at all until suddenly the whole thing became public. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">That's why all these children are meeting themselves for the first time and some of them are making new friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Some of them meeting people they didn't know existed and some of them even finding relatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  So people just if they knew considered it perhaps a quirk or some particular interest but didn't inquire into it very extensively?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  Well, there was no common denominator where they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">150 children coming over and disbursed all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Nearly all of them not finding their parents any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Some of them kept in touch with each other but there was no organization or anything which in any way brought them together until five or six years ago when the story about the children broke.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  Your colleagues didn't inquire into it either?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  I don't think when I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> at 3:30 most of the people knew what I was doing in the evenings. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">There was certainly nobody I knew in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> who in any way helped me with what I was doing with regard to the children, nobody at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">It was two existences, separate, self contained.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  Did your skills as a stockbroker aid you in doing this work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  Oh, I don't think so, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">No, I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">No, I can't think anything in stock broking or the arbitrage that I was doing helped in any way, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I mean, after all, you didn't need any special knowledge to bring children out. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">You needed a lot of effort and work and initiative and dealing with authority and all that, that was general knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">It wasn't any particular knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">It wasn't like the workings of the <span class="BUILDING">stock exchange</span> where you had to know how it worked and what the commissions were and what you had to do and when you had to do it and for whom you had to do it and what the price was and remember the price when you were doing something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">It was nothing like that in dealing with children. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">No, it was quite different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  What suited you for that job? </span><span class="sentence" id="262">What suited you for that work with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">What made you the right person?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">That's for you to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I've always -- if you call that charity work which I suppose it was I've always done charity work. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I've been retired now for 28 years and I've done charity work for 28 years since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">It's just work I like doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">You don't need any particular gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I don't know what urges one on to do it at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  Will you describe your relationship with the Jewish community in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> as they knew that you were doing this work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  I had no connection with the Jewish community in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> because I was brought up as a Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I was baptized and I was brought up as a Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">My parents were Jewish but completely non-religious and I think that we were treated as rather a curiosity. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We didn't fit into either community. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I mean the Jewish people thought we kind of opted out and at that time the Christian community must have thought -- I don't know I'm putting ideas into their minds now, it's rather a curious Christian with a German-Jewish name. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So, we really didn't fit into anybody and I suppose it was this kind of schizophrenia which made up a lot of my character at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  Was the Jewish community aware that you were working to rescue mostly Jewish children from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  I suppose they were but I was very much -- it was very much me and one or two people who were doing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I wasn't assisted -- I mean the British committee for Refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> I know a great number of those were yes, run by the Jewish people but I was quite separate to them, although I used their name until right to the end of the period in I think it was July, August when they said yes, you've been so successful now you better come and join us and they gave me a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> at <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">But until then I got no money from them and no assistance from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">In the various committees throughout the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> for whom most of the guarantees for the children came, I would imagine a lot of those were run by Jewish people, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">But I was only in touch with them by correspondence so I never really met them in that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  Did the British Refugee Committee give you permission to use their name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  Oh, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I just used their name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  Were there any repercussions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  There was nothing they could do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">The only repercussions were as I say after we had been doing that if you like illegally for nearly five months they then said this organization calling themselves the British Committee for Refugees from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> Children's Section is somebody who calls himself Nicky Winton calling himself honorary secretary we declare that they're now part of our organization and we became then a kind of accepted part of the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Before it had been accepted in that way, in a kind of legal way, it had been accepted by everybody who knew no better. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">People out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> getting a letter from the British Committee Children's Section had no reason to believe that it wasn't the British Committee as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So, it worked quite good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  When you say we did you have any help writing these letters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  I had a lady, a girl, who came to help me who had been working for the Christian council and she came every evening and she did all the typing, who in fact later on married Martin Blake. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I don't think we had anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">We were really just the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">It was really a question of keeping the flow of correspondence going and getting the information in from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , getting pictures of the children so that when somebody would take a child we could send them photos and ask them to pick a child, it's unfortunate commercial way of doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Perhaps that's where my stock exchange upbringing came in, but it speeded things up at the time and we felt that speed was of the essence. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">End of Tape 1 Tape 2
QUESTION:  I had just asked Mr. Winton if he would like to say anything else about his relationship with members of the Jewish community in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and what their response was to this work you were doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  Although most of the children we brought out were Jewish I was only looking for families who looked after children. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I wasn't concerned at all whether these children went to Jewish or non-Jewish families and this was largely due to the fact that I think that those people had been out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and those people knew what I was doing, Martin Blake and Doreen Wariner and all that were very conscious of the urgency which one could see out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">There was no question when we were looking for a family to look after the children that a Jew should go to a Jew or a non-Jew should go -- 1t seemed to us at that time perhaps because I'm non-religious myself I don't know but it seemed to me completely secondary. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">The chief thing was to save the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">This was a not a view shared by everybody because there was one organization in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> which was called The Barbican Mission and they took quite a number of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I don't really know how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I mean not an extraordinary number but quite a few children, and they were in existence I found out later, I had no idea at the time merely to convert good Jews into good Christians which even when I heard it didn't really alarm me very much because after all they were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And I thought the most important thing was to save the children rather than save the religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">But I did have a deputy in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> once of rabbis who came in and really told me something for the first time something that I didn't know that these children that I was bringing over and sending to the <span class="BUILDING">Barbican Mission</span> were being made into Christians and I must stop this. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We had quite an animated discussion about it and I think I must have told them in no uncertain terms that I was trying to save the children not trying to save the religion and if anybody would take children, I didn't inquire into those matters and they were very cross at the time saying -- and when I said isn't it better to have a Jew rather than a dead one because we were fairly certain what was going on which very few people were at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Anyway, what you asked me what my connection with the Jewish community was at that time that is one that I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And, it still seems to me a rather unfortunate attitude if it did stop anybody coming over because they couldn't get into a Jewish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">It seems to be very unfair to confine that person to oblivion rather than to a Christian life which after all they could change later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">So, that was my one memory of the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I wasn't myself really in touch with the Jewish community as such at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I mean in any case with a job during the day and this in the evening and on weekends, there wasn't much time at that time for any kind of social life. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Anyway, I was absorbed in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I liked doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I always liked doing charity work. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">No particular to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">My son always says to me that everybody applauds you for doing charity work and you'd be miserable if you didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">So, that's the other side of the coin.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  How did you go about finding people to take these children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">ANSWER:  Well, as I say first of all through certain amount though Eleanor Rathbone and the Quakers and the <span class="BUILDING">Unitarian Church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Then, as I said, Picture Post took it up and printed a letter of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I think there's a copy in that book that you've just taken, every issue that they had and we got -- and then of course by getting hold of the correspondence throughout the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> of the British Committee and when they got a letter from the British Committee Children's Section to them it was completely authentic and in a way it was authentic and that gave the story of the plight of the children out there and stated what we were looking for and most of our guarantors came from that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  Did you actually meet any of the families that were to take these children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  We have met some of the families who took the children through the children now that we've met. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">But of course a lot of them are dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">A lot of them -- I think most of the children that we know say that the people who took them in originally are now dead and those -- one of the children who we know very well, Tom Bearman who lives in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Galilee</span> he comes over and every time he's in Europe he goes up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glasgow</span> to visit his Mama and our great friend who lives near us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maidenhead</span> , Vera Gissing who's written a book called Bells of Childhood which no doubt you've got a copy of. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">She's always inviting her Mama down and invites us round to meet her. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">She must be very old now. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">She's 90. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">You see, a lot of them -- of the ones we know where the guarantor is still alive, they're very faithful in keeping in touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Of course, one must admit that a lot of the children weren't happy where they were sent and there was an after care department in fact when the war started that Mother looked after which tried when children had problems to get the problems settled or get new guarantors for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">But I certainly don't assume and one cannot assume that every child we brought over went into a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and was well treated and was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">A lot of them we know were. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We certainly know some that were not, who were badly treated and used as servants. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">But quite frankly at the time I didn't think of it and it really doesn't concern me very greatly now. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I mean you're bound to have some who weren't happy and all one can say 1s that they are still alive whereas most of the other children aren't. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">One knows that the children were targeted as much as the grownups because the last transport was due to leave at the beginning of September. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">It would have been our biggest. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">250 children, an enormous amount of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Can you imagine getting 250 children from all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> onto a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and then getting 250 guarantors to organize that they should all be at <span class="BUILDING">Liverpool Street Station</span> at a certain time to receive the people whom they had taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Then, of course, war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">The transport was cancelled and as far as we've heard from people who should not know a single one of those children survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So, as I say, I think when you do charity work as I said before, you've got to be pretty tough and if you were concerned more with the fact of are they going to be happy than have they got somebody who will feed and clothe them, you wouldn't bring over nearly as many. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I mean the whole operation would really be different. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">We tried to and all the people who all these committees I talked to around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> they told us that they would not send us any person who would take a child unless they them so to a very great extent they were , but it doesn't mean to say that some don't go wrong and we know that some did go wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">We're in touch today with about 150 of these children or they're in touch with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">That's out of 650 and of those most of them have done extremely well. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">But you can't tell whether the others have never heard of me or whether they did so badly or had such a miserable life that they don't want to, so you really can't draw any conclusions from the fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But a lot of them have done extremely well. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">A lot of them have made big names for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">One of them is in the <span class="BUILDING">House of Lords</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">One of them is a big film producer in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Hugo Moron has made a big name for himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">He's a big man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , and a lot of them have done very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">You can't say whether the majority have because nobody has and I certainly haven't made any effort to get in touch with these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I mean we know that a whole lot went to <span class="REGION">South America</span> and I'm sure in <span class="REGION">South America</span> they've never even heard of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">It was only quite fortuitously that it broke in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and was heard of in certain parts of the world but in a large number of <span class="NPIP">places</span> where certainly a lot of these children went, they have got no idea today how they came or why they came or who organized it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  How many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> were there all together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  Six, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Yes, I think there were six. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">It's in that book when you read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I believe there were six. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">There may have been only five. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">But they're quite interesting statistics breaking them down into religion and all kinds of statistics which are quite interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">QUESTION:  Did you meet any of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> when they arrived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">ANSWER:  All of them, all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Yes, I was at <span class="BUILDING">Liverpool Street Station</span> when every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> arrived which was near to organized chaos as you'll ever get. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And that in the name went well. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">One always has stories of those that got left behind on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> because there was nobody to pick them up, but they were all looked after eventually. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And again, the only trauma that we ever had I'm afraid was with the orthodox Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">One of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> arrived on a Saturday and they wouldn't sign for the children and they wouldn't carry their baggage and you can imagine what we felt like. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">You know, when it was something that seemed to us so unimportant, immaterial, insignificant, but you couldn't let a child go until you had some kind of paperwork to say somebody had got them, and there they were taking the child and no we can't sign it's Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So, I led Mother onto them then and she usually dealt with the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  What did she do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  I don't know but she got them to sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I don't think she went as far as getting them to carry the baggage, but she certainly got them to sign, but then she was a very formidable lady.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">QUESTION:  Will you say a little bit more about her involvement?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  Well, nothing except Father had died and Mother was always interested in what I did and when we did get into and we had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and we started getting people writing in or perhaps even the guarantor would have died and obviously the question came back to the <span class="BUILDING">central office</span> what do we do with the child, that was mother's department then to find another guarantor or to deal with any problems that might have arisen at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">She carried on when the war started because I was doing other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">But as I say not all of them were as satisfactory as one would have hoped but then one wouldn't have expected it. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">You couldn't do an operation like that without something not being successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">It's not possible because after all the children were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Some of the children had no idea why they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">They thought their parents were following them. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Some of them were very upset because their parents had sent them away, doesn't Mommy love me anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Some of them were old enough to know why they came, but there was a lot of disparity amongst the children themselves which we hear now, not knowing why they were sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">How awful for Mother to get rid of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">No idea why. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">How should they know what it was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Some of them were very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">So, there is no standard case. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Either as to the family they went to nor as to the child's attitude at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Some of them adjusted well. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Some of them quite frankly never adjusted and never will. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">But most of the ones, the ones that we met now recently at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Lauderdale</span> , most of them have done extremely well. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">They were all very nice and perfectly composed and ordinary citizens, but then it was a small minority when you think of the kindred meeting that we've just had at Ft. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Lauderdale, where I had to say a few words. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">There were a hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Now, most of them were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German transports</span> which had nothing to do with me at all of which there were 10,000 and of what I call my group that came out of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> over 600, there were four, so I mean you can't tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Why were just those four and those odd hundred present. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Were they the ones that had just heard about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Were they the successful ones? </span><span class="sentence" id="409">You know, it's very difficult if anybody was really writing it up in serious history. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">After an enormous amount of research really to find out fundamental what had happened because all that is written and what is done are those people who have come forward if you like, perfectly voluntary, they needn't have done and one doesn't know why the other -- all right there were 100 out of 10,000 of the Germans there. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Is it a geographical reason? </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Is it for some other reason? </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Is it because they had the money because it's jolly expensive to spend three or four days to come to Ft. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Lauderdale and pay in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So, I would hesitate to draw any standard conclusions really as to the whys and wherefores. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">All one knows really is that yes, those that we brought out should have been brought out because if they weren't they wouldn't exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">That one knows as the absolute standard and definite fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">The rest isn't fact but the best is well it may not be, you don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">The ones we've met now I mean like couldn't be a more normal or nice person but is she the minority, the majority, the standard? </span><span class="sentence" id="420">One doesn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I don't know and I suppose anybody ever will know. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">A lot of people pretend to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">A lot of people write that this is what happened and all this but a lot of it is fantasy, thinking, hoping what they hoped perhaps happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">As I say we are delighted when we meet them and a lot of the people that we meet are absolutely delightful have all done extremely well, but we only meet the minority of the people that we brought out. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">I mean, a lot of them maybe did, but if anybody wanted to do research and try to find out what had happened to 640 children they've got a heck of a job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">QUESTION:  In those days you didn't have much further contact after you met them at the <span class="BUILDING">Station</span> , they'd go off with their --
ANSWER:  None at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I had that job to do and when that job was done, well anyway, the war started and I was doing other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Because of my experience politically and because of what I saw in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and feeling that it was all so inevitable that the politicians could have done other things, I started the war as a consciousness objector and I was in the Red Cross on the continent to start with. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Later on I joined the R.A.F. because eventually one gets drawn into these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">As I said, most of them we met are absolutely delightful. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">One would like to think it's the majority or even all of them are like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="432">QUESTION:  When the war began, it was very clear that you couldn't go on doing this kind of work, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">It was stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">As I tell you, the last transport never came, which would have been the biggest. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">An enormous amount of work had been done. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">You can imagine processing 250 children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Finding 250 guarantors and <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">All the amount of work that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">It was pretty awful, just by a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Ifthe <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had been a day earlier it would have come through.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">QUESTION:  You were a consciousness objector and then you joined the Red Cross, is that right? </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And what were you doing with the Red Cross at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="444">ANSWER:  I went with the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance unit</span> to the continent and came out at the time of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dunkirk</span> and then as I said I joined the R.A.F. At the end, you know, it's all inevitable once war really starts whether you think it could have been stopped or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">It's really immaterial finally isn't it. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It's there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">QUESTION:  How long were you with the Red Cross?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">ANSWER:  Eight months I think, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I can't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">It's not long ago, only about 60 years ago, but I can't remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  The Royal Air Force, you joined voluntarily?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Most of the people we're meeting here are with the R.A.F. Some were with the Czech Air Force.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">QUESTION:  Can you describe briefly what you were doing in the air force?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">ANSWER:  Well, it's not terribly interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I had flown privately so I was a pilot in civil life. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I mean I wasn't a pilot professionally but I did fly as a hobby. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">When I joined up though I couldn't become a pilot because of my eyesight so I became an instructor in what was called the Link, which was a machine teaching pilots night flying. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Which was interesting because my knowledge of French I had a lot of French pilots who were expert in low level flying and didn't know where they were when they got into a cloud so the Link was supposed to show them what they did when they got into a cloud and as a thank you they took me low level flying which was pretty hazardous for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">They had two <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> they didn't go over them, they went sideways through them. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">It was very exciting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  How much did you know during the time that the war was going on about what was happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and that there were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  Nothing at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">There was nothing certain. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I don't think there was anything in the papers about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Anyway, one was doing other things then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">QUESTION:  Did you give much thought during that time to these children that you had just brought over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">ANSWER:  No, I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I mean it was a job that I did and it was a job which was completed as far as I could complete. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">There was nothing else to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I was doing other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , I obviously was told that certain of the children had been in trouble and had to be moved from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another, but other people were looking after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">No, I didn't get very -- I didn't get involved in that in any way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">QUESTION:  You spent after the Royal Air Force and the war ended, what did you do after you were with the Air Force?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">ANSWER:  Oh, when the war ended I joined the Committee for Refugees in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , thinking it would be having got so many people out from where they should have been it was best to join a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to try to get them back again, and I joined this inter-governmental committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> which was taken over or became part of it's more accurate to say, the International Refugee Organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">We became employed by the International Refugee Organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> which was one of the specialized agencies of the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> and my job there was really nothing to do with the repatriation of refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I worked with an American called dealing with the sorting out of all the German loot that had been found in the various <span class="DLF">caves</span> and everything, false teeth and glasses and bags and fountain pens and everything you could imagine was all crated up and given to us to sort out. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Enormous bags and sacks and quantities of watches and alarm clocks, jewelry and we had experts over from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to sort out the jewelry, to find out the real diamonds and the real emeralds and everything from the rubbish and all the jewelry just as one part of the operation was then sent to the in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and I had to go there and supervise the sorting out of this again and eventual smelting it down by into gold ingots which I then took to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and sold and the money went to the Jewish Agency because this was just before the Jewish state was founded and it went to a Mr. Kaplan who was the treasurer of the Jewish agency and became the first chancellor of the of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Everything else I took to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where it was auctioned off and again the money sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> -- well the Jewish Agency.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  You were based in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  Yes, I was based in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I was very little there because I was always either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> or taking the stuff across the Atlantic for sale. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">It's a very big story the story of the liquidation of all the German loot and it's really one of the stories which I don't think has ever been told. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Before all this stuff was smelted I had a camera and I took photos of it in the <span class="DLF">vaults</span> of the in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> with one bulb and about 20 minute exposures which came out very well and very good pictures of all the jewelry and false teeth and gold evening bags and anything you can imagine that was taken then. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I remember only one person who really came down into the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> to see what was going on and that was , at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I wrote all this up as a matter of fact and it's a big book and that I presented to the , and I've got a copy of everything that was written there, but of course, I haven't got the pictures any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">That's an interesting story, very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">It tells more than a lot of articles written about the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">You see a picture of a crate of false teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">You see a picture full of spectacles which we had to smelt down to get the gold out of. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Really, it tells more of the story than all kinds of books can tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">But as I say, when I went to the to give them the original of that book, I thought they'd better have it as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I mean so many people have taken up writing stories about the children, but I don't know of any books that have been written about the finding and the liquidation of all the stuff that was taken from the Jews at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">You'll have to follow it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  How was it found?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  Well, it was found by the Army I'm told in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> , or in <span class="INT_SPACE">caves</span> , and of course we got it from the Army, but when we got it the Army had already sorted it through to a certain extent and we didn't get any of the paintings. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Presumably they had found out the owners. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">We didn't get things like fur coats and we didn't get anything by carpets. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I don't know what they did with them, but I think to start with they tried to find the owners. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I don't really know, but we got the stuff which obviously needed an enormous amount of work done on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">It couldn't be handled in any other way and for which it was then absolutely impossible to find the owners. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">But it was a nasty feeling for weeks and weeks and weeks dealing with all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">It was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I remember going into the and all these things were stored there when we dealt with it and there were crates and crates for example of alarm clocks and you walked into that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and the mere fact of creating a certain vibration in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> some of the alarm clocks started ringing all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">It was quite eerie and we said at the time having sorted it through, this stuff is absolutely worthless and these are <span class="INT_SPACE">interiors</span> of watches and which is absolutely worthless. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">The <span class="NPIP">outside</span> was smelting down because it was gold or silver or something and one of the conditions on which we were working was none of this was allowed to go back to the German economy so when we said look we have all these crates that are absolutely worthless interior of watches and old alarm clocks they said well you'll have to crate it up and on your trip take the good stuff for sale in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> you'll have to get rid of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And we had a ceremony which there is also pictures of that, in the middle of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Atlantic</span> bringing out these crates onto the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Somebody standing there with a big ax and making a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in it and then chucking these crates overboard in mid Atlantic. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">It's quite an interesting story, but as I say lots of people are writing about the children and all that but I haven't seen any stories written about all this loot business which to my mind is just as interesting -- 1t doesn't deal with personalities and people but it deals with a very important story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">QUESTION:  How long were you working in this capacity?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">ANSWER:  I stayed with the I.R.O. until April '48 and then I went to the <span class="BUILDING">International Bank</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  During the time that you were working with the I.R.O. you were only working with the loot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  It must have been a huge amount?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  Well, there was a huge amount but it was all very complicated work. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I mean when you're given a sack of jewelry and you had to first of all to find out what was good and you had these experts who would come from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and all this was displayed and they had to pick out the good stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">My only success was looking at all the stuff that they left behind one day and I thought I'd just look through it for fun and I found one of the most valuable pieces of jewelry all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">So, everybody 1s fallible. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">It just happened to be one of the pieces they missed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  Did anyone come trying to reclaim any of the goods?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  At that period, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I doubt if very many people knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">It's a story which hasn't as I'm saying told since and I don't think there were many people who knew what was going on at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I know that of the loot before it came to us there were things that were identifiable and where possible were returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I've only heard that. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I don't know who did it and how it was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Up to that point it was an army operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">We got the stuff from the army and their brief of what we should do was limited and was regulated by the Paris Reparations Agreement and we had to work under the Paris Reparations Agreement which stated I think it was as most of this stuff belonged to the Jews 95 percent should go to the Jews and I think five percent went to the Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">So, our job was to get 95 percent of it converted into a way that it could be used and the only way that we could do that was converting it into ingots or taking the good stuff all the good jewelry over to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where it was auctioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  You must have been aware at that point of what had happened during the war and the scale of the atrocities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">ANSWER:  Well, I think one knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">When the last transport didn't come and we were told at the time by the Germans that any of the children that we exposed in that way were going to be -- one knew then what was really going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">You can't have all those parents giving up their children without realizing that there was something going on could you? </span><span class="sentence" id="538">It was certainly evident. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">You wouldn't give up your child or three or four and stay behind in danger unless you were fairly certain that it was going to be pretty horrible for the child if he stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Oh, no, I think one knew what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">QUESTION:  What did you say that you did after you stopped working for the I.R.O.?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">ANSWER:  Well, I first of all went to the <span class="BUILDING">International Bank</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> where I met my wife who was working for the <span class="BUILDING">International Bank</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and when that job finished we earned so much money in dollars being grossly over paid by the United Nations, which is still going on I believe that we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> as the first tourists really because nobody else in Europe could get dollars.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">QUESTION:  When was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  Nobody in Europe could get dollars to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">QUESTION:  What year was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">ANSWER:  1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And if we had gone back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> at that time we would have had to give up our dollars which we decided not to do and so we came here in 1950 and spent three months in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="548">We thought we'd seen an awful lot and we looked at that map and saw that we had seen one little <span class="NPIP">corner</span> and apart from being very interesting going around <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> the only interesting thing was that we were literally the first tourists. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I mean when we were asked where are you going to live and we said we were going back to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> the reply was absolutely always the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Why are you going back? </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Don't you like it here? </span><span class="sentence" id="552">The idea of a tourist coming to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> didn't exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Nobody could get the money and there were no such things as tourists. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So we toured <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">We went up to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">We came back and then I started working in all kinds of jobs until I retired 28 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Since then I have done charity work for the mentally handicapped and for the frail elderly. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So, in two words that brings you up to date.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  Was your wife aware of the work you had done in rescuing Czech children before the war began?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  No, I don't think she knew it, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">It was just something I had done and it was finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Until six years ago actually through the Maxwells, Robert and Betty Maxwell it certainly became in the public domain.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="564">QUESTION:  How did that occur?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">ANSWER:  Well, only because I wanted to get rid of these papers and couldn't find anybody interested until somebody took me one day to Dr. Betty Maxwell who was organizing an exhibition of the 50th anniversary of the Holocaust and she was terribly interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">A marvelous lady and she of course told Robert and Robert told the Sunday Mirror and the Sunday Mirror then interviewed me and all these articles appeared in the Sunday Mirror, and the editor of the Sunday Mirror, and then they got onto the Esther Ransom show and through Vera Gissing really then the whole thing started snowballing. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">It's all quite extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="568">QUESTION:  You hadn't thought much about during all those years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="569">ANSWER:  No, it was a finished episode as far as I was concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">QUESTION:  Were you surprised?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">ANSWER:  We were terribly surprised at the Esther Ransom because we didn't know anybody and we weren't told that anything was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">The people like that make a terrific impact and I went up to the <span class="BUILDING">studio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Greta didn't even come because I was told it was merely to go through some script that Esther Ransom had before it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And I was kept waiting and I was put in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> and I saw one person I knew and I wasn't allowed to move because unknown to me the cameras had been trained on a certain <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> that had been reserved for me and only then when the program started did I know that everybody around me were these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So, everybody started crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">It was very emotional, not very pleasant.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">QUESTION:  It must have been overwhelming?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">ANSWER:  Yes, it was pretty awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">But she got her program that she wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">She was in tears at the end herself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="581">QUESTION:  Do you have mixed feelings now about having all of these people in your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">ANSWER:  No, I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I enjoy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Sometimes it becomes a bit overwhelming and a big effort for us to decide to come over at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">It's quite an effort to come over and face everybody and talk, like to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">QUESTION:  After 50 years I would imagine it would be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">ANSWER:  It's more than 50 years now, more like 60.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="588">QUESTION:  I'm happy that you did come and talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Conclusion of Interview </span>
