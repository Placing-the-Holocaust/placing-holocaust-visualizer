<p>ANSWER: None</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Is that the name you were born with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  The first name 1s Anglicized. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">The original name was Gyorgy, but I changed it when I became a citizen because nobody could spell it and pronounce it. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">George is an equivalent English version of Gyorgy, which was my name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And your family name was Pick?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  My family name was Pick, correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  And where were you born, and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Yes, I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , in March 28, 1934.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Now let’s talk a little bit about your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">How long had they been in that <span class="REGION">area</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  My family’s history had been quite intertwined with the Austro-Hungarian empire’s history. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I have records which shows that my family was in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> for at least 250 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I have actual birth certificates and — and other do — documents November 13, 1997 which document this. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And I had a very large family. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I did a little bit of genealogical research. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">It showed that I had roughly 250 family members in the empire. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And I am saying this because when the empire broke up after this first World War, my family sort of stayed to — stayed in the geographical locations they were, but all of a sudden they were citizens of three different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And some of my relatives also lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> , so they became Romanian. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And this was the situation between the two wars. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We were a fairly closely knit family. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">People were keeping in touch with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And I know, for example, of what my great-grandparents did. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">One was on my father’s side, a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And the other one on my father’s side was a merchant, an importer, who imported mostly fruits and spices. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My grand — great-grandparents on my mother’s side, one owned a <span class="DLF">lumberyard</span> , and the second one was a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And so I have quite a bit of — of information about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">My grandparents of — my maternal grandfather was an engineer, a mechanical engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Worked as chief engineer of a — of a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and my grandmother was a housewife. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">My other grandfather was a director of a <span class="BUILDING">lumber company</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My father was a — an engineer and my mother was a paralegal secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So that’s the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I am an only child, I had no brothers or sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">I have a number of cousins, I have a —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What are your parents’ names? </span><span class="sentence" id="33">November 13, 1997</p>
<p>ANSWER:  My father’s original name was Istvan, which is translated roughly to Steven, and my mother’s name was Margit, which is Margaret; that’s what she Anglicized her name to when she came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  And her maiden name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  Her maiden name was Kornhauser, and that’s her father’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Her mother’s maiden name was Spitzer(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And my grandmother on my father’s side, her maiden name was Augenfeld(ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  And you said your father was an engineer, what kind of engineer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  He was a—a mechanical engineer, and he worked for a short time as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Because of some of the Jewish laws, which came into effect in the late 30s, early 40s, he lost his job in January of 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Yeah, we-we’ll get to that in a moment, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">All right, you are born, you said, in 1934. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Did — was your family living in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , or whereabouts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Well, my family lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> , which is the other side of the — the Danube river, and we lived there until I think I was about six or seven, and then we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> , my father, mother and I.</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Do you have any memories of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> , living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube river</span> <span class="RIVER">Danube river</span> , and we lived there until I think I was about six or seven, and then we moved to Pest, my father, mother and I.</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Do you have any memories of Buda, living in Buda?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Yes, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> is a very — very nice hilly section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We lived near a—a large square, where — and a — and a <span class="DLF">hill</span> , <span class="DLF">Gellért hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And my mother took me, when November 13, 1997 I was a child, walking there to both the — the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and the square. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And I — I do remember very well the — th-the <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  Was this a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  No, it was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">There was a Jewish neighborhood in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> , but not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> in Pest, but not in Buda. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And we did — we were very — we were not very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">We were fairly — we — we were really —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Assimilated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Yeah, assimilated, I could say. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And were not very conscious of — of living in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> , although we — we know that we are Jews, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Did your family have any kind of religious observance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  I th — we — we observed the high holidays, but that was about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My father’s side of the family had a number of people who were — who married non-Jews, and they were, I would say, completely non-observant of any religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">A few of them had converted before the war, but most of them stayed Jewish, but were — were completely secular, I would say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  Do you think you knew you were Jewish by the time you were six — up to the time you were six?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  It’s an interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">When I was about four or five years old, my mother took me to a little <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">The <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , in an English sense, was in a November 13, 1997 <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> , and we went there once a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And the teacher was Jewish, and it was a little bit of a physical education type thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And on the corner, just across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from this <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , there was a — a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And I always insisted that we should go into this <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , because I liked the way people were — were praying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">My mother didn’t say anything, and we went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">However, on — by age six, my mother enrolled me into a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish elementary school</span> , and by then I knew very well that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I was also sort of forced into the reality of being Jewish after my father lost his job and he told me that he lost it because we were Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  What language did you speak at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  Well, we spoke German, mostly my mother and father and grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I would say they did, I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And they spoke it because they didn’t want me to understand certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I was taught German when I was in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , and I spoke fairly well for a few years, but then I’ve completely forgotten it. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Hungarian was the main language, essentially.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Was your father, or your parents in any way Zionists?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  They were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">They were not Zionists at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">There was a —I had an uncle who came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in the late 30s and he first wanted us to come, and sent papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">This was in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="81"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was a neutral country until June of ’41, so November 13, 1997 people could theoretically at least, leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">My uncle, who was a physician when he emigrated, brought — took our papers and sent us some affidavits, but my father was very reluctant. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">He — he didn’t want to start again, and the un — my uncle was fairly discouraging as far as the possibilities of employment, because on — he was telling my father that he would be sort of a tradesman, maybe a mechanic. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Well, my father was an engineer and a businessman and he didn’t want to step down the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> , so we didn’t do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Then in 1940, he offered my mother that he would adopt me, and that he would take me, but my mother declined that offer. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So, because of that, I got stuck in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> with my parents, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  When was the first time that you remember hearing the name Hitler? </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Granted, you were very young in the 30s. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Do you have any memories up til 1939 of your parents talking about this man, or what was happening, how conditions were changing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  I have very vivid memories in 1938 of Hitler, because Hitler speeches were broadcast in the radio, and I remember this frightening voice, and — and his yelling and screaming, and —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And you were only four and a half.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Correct, but I remember it very vividly because it was frightening me. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I mean, I didn’t understand the language, but the way he spoke was — was very frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">November 13, 1997</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you say anything to your parents, or do you remember them comforting you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  I don’t remember them comforting me, I think I — I said to my parents that — that this man was a very frightening person, the way he spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And we had [coughing] excuse me — we had a prime minister at the time who was also a great anti-Semite, and I remember — well, I don’t remember the — the speeches, but I do remember the kinds of — of expressions he — he — he used, which again, were — were frightening to me, although I was only a youngster. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I was a fairly precocious child and I was well aware of some of the politic — political figures, Churchill, Roosevelt, Hitler and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And in fact, it was a sort of a joke in the family that people always ask me, you know, who was the Prime Minister of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , or who was the president of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , or whatever else, and I always knew the answer, even when I was in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So I was sort of regarded as a smart kid, and I — I was more aware, probably, than an average four or five years old, about what was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Okay, let’s move now to 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Is that the year you said your father lost his job?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">In main of — May of ’39, when the second Jewish law came into effect, my father lost his job, but 1t was more than that, because that particular law, also allowed what they called people who were not trustworthy for the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They allowed the government to induct them into labor brigades. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And of course, November 13, 1997 these groups included communists and Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And because of that, a number of my uncles, and among them, my father as well, was impacted very shortly. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Actually, 1940, my father was inducted into a labor brigade. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And they took him to Carpathia-Ruthenia, which at that time was already occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Carpathia-Ruthenia</span> , which at that time was already occupied by Hungary. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And they sent him to build <span class="DLF">roads</span> , strategic <span class="DLF">roads</span> in that <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  When did you say he was taken away”</p>
<p>ANSWER:  This — this was in — in September of 1940, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What did he do between the time he lost his job, and being taken away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Okay, between the time he lost his job and being taken away, many Jews figured a way to go around the — the laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">According to the laws, which were designed to squeeze the Jews out of the economic life of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , a Jew could not practice business. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But what they did, what the Jews did is they hired a Christian person who would then take out the business license, and they would work under him. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And in our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we lived, there was a super by name of George Dudek(ph) who was a very kind man. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">He was a friend of my f-father’s, and he volunteer — he — he essentially agreed with my father that he would take out the license, and of course my father paid him a stipend, and under this — with this arrangement, my father was able to — to do that — some business. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Now, when I talk about business, it was not a f — it was not a formal <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">What — what they have done, and this is a fairly November 13, 1997 interesting story, is they — they went to <span class="BUILDING">coffeehouses</span> , and they met there Jews and non-Jews and they made business essentially on a handshake [indecipherable] and they sold them both things. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">My father, being an engineer was more familiar with engineering materials, so he — he sold scrap iron, scrap materials and bought — bought them as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And he had some partners who were — and business partners who were both Christian and Jew, and that’s how he essentially made a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And bet — and after °39, he has done that for — for quite awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">As you see, he came back after the 1940 induction, and then he was inducted another time. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But between 1939 and 1944, he was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> most of the time, and when he was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he was doing this, he was practicing business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  When you were very young, did you have non-Jewish friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I remember one, I don’t remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">My grandparents had a little <span class="BUILDING">home</span> — a little <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , a little <span class="DLF">yard</span> and a — a small <span class="BUILDING">bungalow</span> , about 20 miles from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , which we used, as well as some of my other relatives for summer — a <span class="BUILDING">summer cottage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And I remember in 1940 particularly in the summer of ’40, we went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">My mother and I stayed there for maybe a month, and my father came out on the weekends and we had some — I had some next door neighbors, little <span class="DLF">mini- farms</span> , and kids came over, peasant children, and the — we played. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And there was absolutely no talk about whether you were Jewish or you were not, they were just November 13, 1997 friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And — and as I said, I had a number of them from that — it was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gerdaler(ph</span> ) and we had a next door neighbor, was a Serbian couple, and we were very friendly with them, and some others, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> we lived in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> had a few children. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">In fact, our next door neighbor had two girls, and the next door neighbor was a professional soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He was a — a — an officer in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And I was extremely friendly with their kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I was —1f I wasn’t <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I was there, and they sort of regarded me as — as a family member. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">When there was Christmas, they had a little gift for me under the Christmas tree. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And I have a number of pictures with the — with the two girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">One was my age, and the other was a couple of years younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">The next neighbor next door was also very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They — they had a — a girl who was my age as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And the three girls and myself, we were almost inseparable friends in the age four to seven or eight, even up to 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And again, there was very little, to me, was very little awareness of — of what’s the difference between a Jew and a non-Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  So you’re saying you didn’t experience any anti-Semitic remarks at that time, during that interval?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  I—I wouldn’t say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">What I was saying 1s that I did have non-Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We had a number of anti-Semites in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And there was one incident which I remember very vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">There was a teacher, who was a — quite an anti-Semite and November 13, 1997 he disliked me and I disliked him also, and once he asked me something, and I sort of a smart-alecky answer and he gave me a big slap on the face. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And I — that was the first time I have ever ha-had — even my parents didn’t do things like that to me, and I was very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And the interesting end of this story was that a couple of years — couple of days later, this fellow came over and apologized to me that he did this, that he shouldn’t have. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">But I know that his feelings were not very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">But he —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Do you think that’s because you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  I am almost positive that that was the case, that because I was Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  How do you know that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Well, I think he was a member of some sort of a Hungarian Nazi party. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And he was certainly — he was the warden, the air raid warden there, and he was very gung- ho on — on the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">This was the first year of the war, when this whole thing happened, in 1941, and I know that he was — he was nationalist at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">But I—I-I always had the feeling that he was also an anti-Semite.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  What was it like for you as a young child to have your father tell you that he lost his job, his work, because he was Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Do you remember what your reaction was at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  Well, I — I don’t — I don’t remember what my reaction was, but I remember when he lost his job. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I do not recall whether it was a panic time or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">But he has November 13, 1997 lost his job many times during the — the depression, and he always found something to do, and somehow to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">He was a man who could make a living on a — in <span class="REGION">Antarctica</span> probably as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">He was a very ingenious person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  So you don’t remember feeling particularly threatened in 1939 because you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  I did not feel threatened economically, but as I said, I had this — I mean, I heard Hitler and I heard the prime minister of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> speak and yell. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I certainly was frightened by this. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Maybe I was not completely conscious as to what could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">But just the — the voices were disturbing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  What kind of relationship did you have with your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Was it a very close one, did you feel you could talk to them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  My relationship with my parents at this time was close to my mother and not very close to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">My father was a fairly cold person. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">He was not a kind of a person who would — would color, or who would tell me that he loves me, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And he was not a kind of a person who would want to take me to <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">There was always a great disagreement between my mother and father as to how to bra — how to bring me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">My father felt that my mother was coddling me too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">He called it a monkey love, and he wanted to make a man out of me, and he felt that I was just too soft. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And over the years, this — this translated into a — a fairly November 13, 1997 distant relationship between myself and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Even later in my years, I — he felt that I—I just did not meet his expectations in terms of physical prowess. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">My family, particularly my father’s family had a number of gymnastic champions and — and great sportsmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">My uncle was an Olympic — he was a European champion of gymnastics and seven times Hungarian champion. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And both my aunt and my uncle on my father’s side were attending the Los Angeles Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">My uncle also went to the Amsterdam Olympics and Stockholm Olympics as a — as a part of the Olympic team of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And with that, of course, with that kind of competition, no, I was — was not able to compete. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">My father was, in his younger days, pretty physically active. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">In his 40s he was not as active as he was earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But he expected me to follow his footsteps and his brother’s footstep, who was a — a great skier and mountain climber, and I was never able to fulfill these kind of things, so he sort of gave up on me on that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="193">ANSWER:  If Iremember correctly, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> they lived with my mother — maternal grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">This was right after they got married, and they really could not afford to live apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">In the late 30s, they had improved the financial conditions where my father beg — was working for a couple of years there, and I guess they were able to November 13, 1997 afford to move away. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">They didn’t want to move into a very expensive <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , first they moved into a — a fairly low — middle class neighborhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">But then later, in 1940, me — we moved into an upper class place in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> , in — which at that point was sort of considered a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> <span class="BUILDING">upper class place</span> in — in Buda — in Pest, in — which at that point was sort of considered a suburbs.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="203">QUESTION:  Why did you go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  Well, there were several reasons for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">One of it is that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was considered very good, and at that point I think my parents became aware that I should be more aware of my — my Jewishness. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And so they decided that this was a— a good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And indeed it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">I had met children, both girls and boys, who were — essentially who became lifelong friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">In fact, I still have a number of them here in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , whom I known since age six from first <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And so it was a—a-—a great bond, as it turned out. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">We had a great teacher Arn(ph) Magda(ph) who was a— a young woman at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And I remember the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as a very friendly <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and as a very friendly <span class="NPIP">place</span> to — to go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I also remember November 13, 1997 that my mother took me every ni — every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was about a half an hour walking distance from where li — where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And I always woke up late. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Actually, my mother didn’t have the heart to wake me up early enough, so that we ended up running all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And — and she — I remember very well that she always had my — hand my — held my hand, and we ran through this city park to get to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> <span class="DLF">city park</span> to get to the school. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And I also remember the other teachers, other than just Arn(ph) Magda(ph).</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Actually, they were some of my relatives who were able — there was one uncle, his name was Gustie — Gustav. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">He lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and after the anschluss he was arrested, and they took him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And for — and I am not sure and I don’t remember how, but after about a year and a half in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , he was let go, and he managed to slip over the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and became an illegal alien. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And I remember him very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">He — we used to have a family gathering in my matern — paternal grandmother’s and grandfather’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">They had a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and it was a family tradition that we got together every Sunday afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">My cousins, my aunts, uncles and ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And I remember Uncle Gustie came at that time and he was telling us stories about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And we sort of didn’t November 13, 1997 believe him very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">He was a very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I didn’t realize it until after the war that he was a multimillionaire who at the end did not survive, and who left all his <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> for nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Ma — on my mother’s side, there were several great-aunts and children and — who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And I remember Ileanor(ph) and her — her 16 year old boy Garbore(ph) and her husband, they were able to slip across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> <span class="RIVER">Danube</span> in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And they lived again as illegal refugees in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We, between 1942 and 1944 were able to hide them. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">It will — this follows, we had a fairly large family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">They — every night they slept somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And so every week or week and a half, we were the ones who were hiding them, and my mother and grandmother were particularly fairly nervous when they slept in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Had — they had some papers, but they were not very good.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  All this was believed? </span><span class="sentence" id="248">November 13, 1997</p>
<p>ANSWER:  All this was not believed very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">We — we didn’t think they were lying, but we certainly didn’t think that it could happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And so, although we were nervous about their status, and we obviously were family, and we helped them as much. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">There was, for example, one uncle who — who was a very nice guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">He was — his name was Louie, and he was a very religious Catholic al — although he was not born Catholic, he was a Jew who converted. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And he was a great family man, and he was the one who got false papers to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Somebody — and I do not know who and why and how, betrayed him, and he went to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for six months, because he not only helped the relatives, he helped other people in getting false papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">At that time, there were approximately 10,000 Polish and che — Czechoslovakian Jews living illegally in ha —- in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at that time was regarded as some sort of a haven, a safe haven for — for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Again, the Hungarian government sort of knew about their existence and tolerated them, but that they were still illegal and they had very little possibilities of — of doing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">They couldn’t work, they were essentially charity cases for the — for their families.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Let’s back up. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">What’s it like for a nine year old to see his father in a — you know, taken away and having to do this kind of work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  Well, we had a family tradition, we never went to — to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We always said goodbye at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And it was a very traumatic experience, of course, he November 13, 1997 — I remember his rucksack, his — his thing, he carried his things with him and he bought good shoes and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And it was — we were always terribly distraught, because of course, we never knew how long my father would be taken, or if we would ever see him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">It never — 1t’s sad, you know, you are inducted, and you have to go to such and such a <span class="NPIP">place</span> within 48 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">But we never knew what his <span class="NPIP">destination</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And then, of course, when we heard from him, when he was taken to a—to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> , it took roughly a month before we knew where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="318">ANSWER:  I—I do not remember his first name, but I remember his last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">and he was much frightened after the war, because he knew that he made all these statements, and he was particularly frightened when he — when we returned, and he thought we would denounce him; we did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Going back to 1943, my father was deactivated, and after that we went to a — take a — a week — one week vacation to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And it was a —a <span class="BUILDING">luxury hotel</span> , and Jews were allowed to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">There was only November 13, 1997 one <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , which was not open to Jews, which was open to army personnel, army officers actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And it was a beautiful summer and we enjoyed ourselves very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">One afternoon, my mother and I took a walk in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And there, in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , we saw a large group of men in Nazi uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">They were the Hungarian Nazis, called the Nyilas, and they had the rally there. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And that was the first time we really saw these people, and they were yelling and screaming and we were really frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And we sort of managed to slip away, but — but this really sort of banged reality to our consciousness in terms of — well, here these people, we — we thought these people were underground wi — they were e — theoretically illegal, they were not allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Their leader was in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , but yet they were organizing and they were meeting in these <span class="NPIP">places</span> out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , in faraway places from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and — and we became more aware that these people were real. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I mean, we — we — we knew the propaganda, we knew that these people existed, but this was my firsthand encounter with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  What’s it like to see someone in a uniform like that when you’re nine years old?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Well, we didn’t talk very much about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I knew that my mother was very frightened, and we sort of left, and we tried to sort of not to speak about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We thought — we didn’t ignore it, because I remember it, but we did not want to — she didn’t want to emphasize that, look, these people are terrible, and we are going to have terrible times. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">We really hoped at that point that the war is turning, that we will be able to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">That before anything would happen, the war would be over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">QUESTION:  So it’s 1942 - ’43, and you are still going to this <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="348">November 13, 1997</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  And then what is the next big change that you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  Well, the — the — the next big change, what I remember was that in 19 — end of 1943, beginning of 1944, my mother decided that I am now old enough to learn a little bit about music and culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And next <span class="DLF">door</span> we had a lady who happens to be Jewish — happened to be Jewish, and who was a violin teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And we went there — actually it was maybe 1943 when I started violin lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And I never got too far, but what I did get out of it was a love of music. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And I remember that in 1943, my mother decided that we were going to buy some season’s tickets for a musical and opera performances. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">All the Jewish performers were thrown out from their jobs in 1940 - °41. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , in the Jewish community center, there was a cult — there was a -— like a <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> , <span class="BUILDING">culture hall</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community center</span> , there was a cult — there was a -— like a hall, culture hall. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Small <span class="BUILDING">hall</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">QUESTION:  This is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">In [indecipherable] 12, and it’s called the <span class="BUILDING">Goldmark Hall</span> in memory of Karl Goldmark, who was a Jewish composer. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And curiously and — and ironically enough, the people who were thrown out for the first class, the best singers, the best musicians. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And so what they did, in order to make a living, they essentially organized their orchestra, and organized their — an opera company. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And almost daily they had concerts and opera performances, and it was a very vibrant November 13, 1997 and I would — should say a better quality of performance than in the <span class="BUILDING">opera house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">So my mother bought tickets, and I remember that my first opera, which I saw, was Rossini’s “Moses.” </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And I saw a number of operas, Faust. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And we had opera tickets like once e-every two weeks, on Sundays. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And we had opera tickets for “The Queen of Sheba,” which was a Karl Goldmark opera for the — on the 20 — on the 19" of March, for the 19" of March. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And it was a sort of a birthday present for me because my birthday’s the 28" of March. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So, we never went. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Why didn’t we? </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Because on the morning of the 19", the Germans came in, and the performance was postponed indefinitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> went on for a couple of more — I think maybe a week or So.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  The Germans came in, what do you remember about that day? </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Can you talk about March 19"?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  Yes, I remember the Germans came in, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> came in and it was very frightening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  What do <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> look like to a 10 year old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  Huge. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I remember the Tigers, they were — they were unbelievably big. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Tiger tanks</span> were the — the largest <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And I remember, as they rumbled through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and the <span class="DLF">street</span> — we lived in a s — on a <span class="DLF">street</span> which sort of led into the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">It was a wide <span class="DLF">street</span> , and it was very much — it had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> , November 13, 1997 but it ha — it had enough room for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">I remember also 12 years later in 1956, when the Russian tanks rumbled on the same <span class="DLF">street</span> , toward the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tanks</span> rumbled on the same street, toward the center of the city. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">But on that 19" of March, it was absolutely frightening because we did not know what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">We knew that something terrible had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">We heard the radio, and it was, you know, every hour on the hour there were more things, saying, you know, orders given to various units. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Hungarian units do this, you know, fari — code words or code numbers, you know, 12th Hungarian division, be alert, or bring — bring yourselves to whatever <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And what I remember is the confusion, and the — the disbelief that this could happen to us, and the — an-and the belief that — that now, something which we didn’t think would happen, will. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And of course, the optimist would say well, you know, what can the Germans do’? </span><span class="sentence" id="389">The Germans came in because — we know why they came in, because the Russians are pushing the German army toward the west and the Germans want to make sure that the — the German army has a retreat, you know, it wants to make sure that — that — that it could retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">We also knew somewhat earlier that the Hungarian government was already discussing peace feelers with — with the Brits, and that that government was quite liberal and looked the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Well, that all changed on that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">In three days a new government was sworn in, Dome Sztojay, who was a-— p-prior to this was the — the ambassador of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And he November 13, 1997 was essentially a — an — he — he didn’t speak very good Hungarian, he was a German himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">There were these Germans in the west side of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , groups of Germans living there, we called them Schwabs. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">They were the — th-the ethnic Germans, and Sztéjay was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And his government was containing the extreme Nazi elements. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">The only thing which was relatively heartening to us is that the — that Horthy, who was the head of the government, stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Now, we found out that Horthy was out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and — but he came back later that afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">He was with Hitler, and of course that was the trick Hitler used; while Horthy was out, that’s when the — they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">We also found out that a couple of days later, that Eichmann and company also showed up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">The reason why I know this is that my mother had an uncle who was a very prominent lawyer, and who was still practicing law in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And the reason why he was — were two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">One is that he was a World War I hero, a very decorated captain of the Austro-Hungarian army, and he was exempt from Jewish law. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And secondly, he was a good friend of the German ambassador, Jakov. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Well, Jakov left, Veesenmeyer came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And va — before Jakov left, he told my Grand-uncle Paul, Paul Kornhauser, whose son was lost in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Voronezh</span> , that Paul, things are changing. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">But Paul was a Germanophile all his life, a-an admirer of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Never really believed that anything could happen to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">He was a prominent Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">He was not very religious, but he was very November 13, 1997 active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Many of the Jewish leaders told him that he’s on a list, that he should go into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Well, he didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">In fact, when he got his summons, the first one ha — Eichmann did the same thing as he did everywhere else, he’s — he summoned the prominent Jewish leaders the first three days or four days after this occupation, to a — a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">interim camp</span> , and my uncle, my great-uncle took his dress uniform, his Hungarian dress uniform with all his medals and went in and demanded to be exempted from all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Well, they didn’t exempt him at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">In fact, they — they captured him and in a week, he and a hundred prominent Jewish leaders were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and he died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So we knew that things are happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">We also knew that by the fifth of April — on the 28" of March, my 10" birthday came out a — the law that we must wear the yellow stars in a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So by the fifth of April we all wore the yellow stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">That was sort of my 10" birthday present.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">QUESTION:  How does it feel to wear a yellow star?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">ANSWER:  Well, it — it certainly was — was something different. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I was not very easy to accept that now everybody knows that I am different. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I mean, up until now I — people the — we — we lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where — in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where two or three Jewish families lived, the rest of them were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">This was not a — an issue, I mean, although anti-Semitism we knew about, but as I said, there were a number of November 13, 1997 Christians who were friends, and sympathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">But now, this was a — a —a huge sign on one’s coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">It was easy to see who was. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And of course, we did not know who the — the — the enemies were. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Whom, we didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And it was —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Were you — were you unhappy about being Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  No, I was not unhappy being — being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">No, at that part — time, I was already very consciously Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">We had the Bible studies and Hebrew in — in <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , and I was much more conscious about being Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">QUESTION:  Would you have preferred to be something else? </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I’m talking as a 10 year old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">ANSWER:  Oh I cert — I would have preferred to be not there, so — for sure, but I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I— I would say that I was — I was a proud Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I w — I was — probably wouldn’t prefer to be anything but a Jew, but I certainly would have preferred to be not a Jew who is — who is going to be sent to the <span class="BUILDING">slaughterhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And what — what happened there in the — on the same day when we started to have to wear this Jewish star, my father and other Jewish men from 18 to 60 were inducted again. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So essentially, my mother, my grandmother and I stayed behind, and my grandparents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  Did your mother sew on the Jewish star on your clothes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">ANSWER:  Yes, and I remember that — that it was in the newspapers, you know, they were — they were telling us exactly how big is has to be, and how yellow and y-you — you could buy this material, but 1t cannot be orange, it has to be very lemon yellow, and November 13, 1997 it has to be this big and this wide and all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And I remember how we — we were cutting it on the — on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room table</span> , these things and we were counting how many we need for the outer garments and inner garments, and it was a— and then my mother and grandmother were sewing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And we had to wear it on the — right above our hearts on the left side. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But what was really traumatic was — is as I said, is my father had to leave again, and this time, of course, what do we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And we didn’t hear from him for a long while, and about a month or so later, we heard rumors that the — that the Jews in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> — and I had 150 relatives — are starting to be gathered into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And there was an interesting things which happened, which was another lost opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">My mother’s family had a friend, and his — he was a — a romane — he was — he was a Romanian, or he lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , but he was Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> in April, middle of April, and came to my mother and said —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  Ninte — 1944, correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And he said to her, he said, look, things in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> are come and gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I’ll take George with me, and he’ll be safe with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">My mother refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">So this was another missed opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And then he went and we never heard of him afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">We n— we don’t know what happened to him and his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">But he is a— he was an old friend, and he was a trustworthy friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">But, November 13, 1997 whether it would have been better for me to go with him, or not, who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Obviously, in the final [indecipherable] I was okay at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">That happened in April. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">We didn’t hear about my relatives except these rumors, and these rumors were getting more and more disturbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Then we had a lot of different rules and regulations. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">We had to submit our radio, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> , our telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And we were cut off from the world, because we had no radio, for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So we didn’t know what was going on.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  What were you and your other 10 year old friends talking about? </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Did you used to talk about the war, or did you just talk about typical children’s things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">ANSWER:  Oh, we would — we talk more — more about typical children’s thing, in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was abruptly ending. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">By the middle of April, we had no <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it was all finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">It was the — I completed the fourth grade, I got my paper saying that I completed the fourth grade and — and the Jewish kids no longer were allowed to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I remember the fi — about two weeks after we had the — the red — the November 13, 1997 yellow star on us, we still went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but then it was over and they told us that we should come in October to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">rigi</span> — to register for the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , for <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">October was not a good time to register that year, unfortunately. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">At <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , there were just too many things happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">We were listening — the radio we couldn’t listen to, but they had these — these announcements which they mounted on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And every day there was 20 - 30 different things, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">We were rushing around and we were trying to make sure that we have food at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we were —</p>

A-As — if I remember, I — PII — I'll let you know later. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">But that was right before my father was taken away in — in the middle of April. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Once my father was taken, and as I mentioned, we were in a— ina panic every day because they had pages and pages of new regulations and orders, which in — which affected us. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">What we have to — what we cannot use, what we have to give in, and then finally, when we heard these rumors about what happened to the — the Jews in the <span class="REGION">provinces</span> — you know, these were just slight rumors, and then we got — but we were very busy then, because we — we got the order that we have to vacate our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and we have to move into these special <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  Can we just back up a little bit? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Do you think your parents ever considered getting, as some people tried to do, getting a baptismal certificate? </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Do you think they ever thought about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  Well, I know that my father never thought of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">My mother, in April heard that if you get a baptismal certificate, you may be exempt from something, and she talked to my father about it, and my father said, well, go ahead if you want to do it; [am November 13, 1997 not going to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And I remember that she and I went a couple of times, maybe twice, to a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> not too far from where we lived, where we had these — they call them white sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">White sisters’ convent. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And they were giving a group of Jews lessons about the catechism. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And we went, I think, maybe twice, and then my mother saw the futility of it, and she said no, forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">So —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did it bother you to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">ANSWER:  It —1t didn’t bother me to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I didn’t understand the catechism at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">I couldn’t understand what — it was like Chinese to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">But — but the — the sisters were kind, and it was — if it were something which would really help, I would say why — why not to do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I mean, a lot of people did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">It turned out that — that conversions did not help at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">My — my uncle, who was converted because he believed in Catholicism, by the Primate of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in the early 30s, and who went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> every Sunday, was inducted as a Jew, because both his parents were Jewish and he was Jewish and his conversion was too late, and the only difference between him and my father was that he wore a white armband while my father wore a yellow armband. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And — but he got the same treatment, in fact worse, and he ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and he was gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So we knew that — that conversions were, at that point, ineffective, but when in — when you are in a situation like this, you try anything and everything you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">But it always struck me and it always stayed with November 13, 1997 me, that despite of the fact that my father was — I don’t think he had gone into a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> a half a dozen times in his last 20 years of his life, he still would refuse to do this, and that he was very much of a — a-—a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">But he allowed us to, if he wanted to, they gave us this — this — this choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So, what happened to us then, May came, and we got the — the order that we have to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And we moved in June, toward the end of June. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">We were not allowed to take any <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> with us, only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , and only the most crucial clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">End of Tape One, Side B November 13, 1997 Beginning Tape Two, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with George Pick. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">This is tape two, side A.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  It was June 17 when —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  — 1944 when we had the, essentially the deadline to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And my grandmother, myself and my mother moved in — in with my grandmother’s younger sister, who lived about two or three blocks away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  How did you get the order? </span><span class="sentence" id="547">How did they notify you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">ANSWER:  Well, they — they — they notified by — via newspaper, essentially everybody — the newspapers came out, as I mentioned, with many, many orders every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And repeated deadlines, you know, when you have to move out and what <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> are available and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So it was av — a lot of bureaucratic — but very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I mean, the time the deadlines were days instead of weeks or months. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And it was quite lucky for us that we had, in this <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> where we moved to, we had several relatives living there, on <span class="DLF">Columbus Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">We lived in Elizabeth Street, which was a main <span class="DLF">street</span> <span class="DLF">Elizabeth Street</span> , which was a main street. </span><span class="sentence" id="554"><span class="DLF">Columbus Street</span> was like a side street.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">QUESTION:  Did you take anything special with you from your own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="556">November 13, 1997</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, I—I took some toys; not very many, because there was just no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for that, because we moved into a <span class="NPIP">two room place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">The si — the three of us occupied one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and my grandmother’s sister, her daughter, and the — and her daughter’s brother occupied another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And then we had a meet — or ev — or almost every <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> had a maid room — maid’s room over the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">maid room</span> — <span class="INT_SPACE">maid’s room</span> over the kitchen. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And they took a single woman there, so she was the seventh person living in a <span class="NPIP">two room place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And the only thing we could take 1s a — 1s essentially our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And I remember, the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was not that ver — large, and it was wall to wall <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">We had nowhere to eat, or we had to sit on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa bed</span> to eat, essentially. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And this was the — as I said, the 17" of June, and we heard rumors that things are happening in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">We did not know precisely what.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  Were these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> marked in any way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  They were — they had the large yellow star, as if to tell people that this — this is a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where, you know, Jews live, or lepers live, whatever you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">There was one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> which was occupied by a Christian family. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">The man was the super of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , his name was Mr. Vargo(ph), Janus(ph) Vargo(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="569">He was a decent fellow, and as you will hear, the — his actions were quite crucial in saving our lives; both my grandmothers and the relatives there, and my mother’s and mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">We settled in, essentially in the last week of June. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">There were a few young people, I November 13, 1997 was the youngest kid, there were no kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">There were a few teenagers, mostly older people. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And almost daily, toward the end of June, we started to have to go down to the <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> , because of air raids. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I remember one particular day very vividly, and that was July the second, 1944; it was a Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And even before, I was always worried about air raids, because evas — ever since the April air raid, ever since my aunt was hurt, I was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And I remember once Mr. Vargo(ph) [indecipherable] was on the second of July, he — after everybody was ordered to the air raid shelter, he took me upstairs to the — just to the street level, to show me how beautiful those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> , he took me upstairs to the — just to the street level, to show me how beautiful those airplanes are. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And they were, I mean, indeed, huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> coming in, hundreds of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And I — I can never forget the — the tremendous number. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">I mean, they almost covered the <span class="DLF">sky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And we were out there maybe one or two minutes, and then I said no, I don’t want to stay there, I want to go downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">So we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And we sat there very quietly for about 10 minutes and then all of a sudden we heard this tremendous crash. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">At first is a whistling sound, a crash and the whole <span class="BUILDING">building</span> shook up. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And I started to scream and everybody else did too, and my mother sort of put my — my head against her — her bosom and trying to put her hands again — in my — on my ears so that I wouldn’t hear this. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And a few minutes later another, even larger sound, and it was like an earthquake. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And we saw — we had these blast do — <span class="DLF">doors</span> leading to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and — and it’s — this — this is a very heavy steel door. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And November 13, 1997 along the <span class="DLF">door</span> you see this brilliant light coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Of course, by then the electricity was gone, and we were sitting in the pitch dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And — and this — this was like — like <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And it went on for three hours, and we had four more very close hits, and we didn’t think that we were going to survive, and then we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And after three hours we came up, and what we saw was incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">We had — this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was a three story <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">It was sort of stood by itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">About a hundred yards behind it, there was a six story <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> , which was hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And the only thing — and it was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> , with the same yellow star like we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">The only thing which stayed up there was one <span class="DLF">fire wall</span> , and everything was down on — in a big heap, and people were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Across the <span class="DLF">street</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">private home</span> , before the raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Afterwards, there was just a huge crater in the — crater in the — on the — on the — on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> , and you could see body parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">You could see hands and legs and [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And this — the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> had four <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tennis courts</span> <span class="DLF">tennis courts</span> , nothing but a big crater. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And the left side was a — just a <span class="DLF">vacant lot</span> , and a crater. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">So essentially, within a hundred yards of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , we had four huge bombs hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And I could almost feel even today this — this smell of — of — of death there and — and — and everything was smoking, and it was blackened, and purple, the <span class="DLF">sky</span> was purple. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And some people were optimists. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I — I just can’t believe that people said well, maybe this is the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Maybe — maybe this was used as a — as a camouflage to November 13, 1997 — to drop paratroopers here, and maybe the Brits and the Americans are here, and we will be coming — we’ll be freed. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And of course, that was not the case at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">What was the real story was that it was the first carpet bombing of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and 30 percent of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> went — was in ruins, and the Jews were blamed for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  How are the Jews blamed for it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">ANSWER:  Well, the propaganda, I mean, the — the radios were blaring that it was a Jewish conspiracy, that Jews left their lights on their <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> to show where the — where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was, because of course we had blackouts at — at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Well, blackou — and — and of course, if you were caught with any kind of light seeping through, that was a punishable — death punishable offense. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And when — we were very careful looking around all the time, to make sure that there is no light, because we were accused of — of spying, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">QUESTION:  Was this the first time you had seen dead bodies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">ANSWER:  It was. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Actually, these kind of dead bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">There was one dead body I saw a few days before this. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And this happened because there was a pharmacist who lived in our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and who poisoned himself, he committed suicide, and I saw him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">QUESTION:  This was a Jewish pharmacist?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="619">ANSWER:  Jewish pharmacist who lived there, and I saw him being taken away ina <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> and he was — his hands were — I didn’t see his face because it was turned, November 13, 1997 but his hands were yellow and were sort of hanging down from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretcher</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And that was the first dead body. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But the number of dead bodies after this raid, they were — they were really huge. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And the first time that I saw this kind of — it’s not just dead, I mean, they were bloody. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">It was — was — was — was like <span class="NPIP">hell</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">QUESTION:  How does a 10 year old process something like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">ANSWER:  Well, I was absolutely frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">After this, every t-two — twice a day, all regular like clockwork, at 11 0’clock in the morning, the — the westerns allies came, and then nine o’clock at night the Russians came in bombing raids. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And every time this happened, my mother had a huge pillow, which she put on my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And to show you how traumatic it was, it took 30 years for me to be able to sleep without a pillow over my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And — and it was — it was an absolute trauma. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I mean, I — I — even today, if I hear some unexpected large noise, loud noise, I would jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">We did not know it at the time, that besides the air raid, we had an even deadlier situation developing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">What had happened is 3,000 gendarmes came out — came up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> two days before, in process, or in — in the process of wanting us to be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">In other words, by this — by the first of July, most of the Hungarian Jews from the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">The only community alive was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">My 150 relatives were largely dead by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">We did not know this, but what had happened is the extreme Nazis wanted to commit a coup, and get rid of November 13, 1997 Horthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And they got these 3,000 gendarmes for two reasons; one is to prepare for deportation of the Jews, and number two is to get rid of Horthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And there was only just a few, the courage of a few army officers who were available and who were ready to follow orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And one single army unit, a Panzer division was willing to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to counteract this — not necessarily the deportation of the Jews, but the — the coup against the <span class="REGION">region</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And by the second of July, they were around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , taking up positions. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">By the seventh of July, they forced these gendarmes to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And Horthy declared that that day, that they deportations would stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And that, of course, saved our lives, because with 3,000 gendarmes, we would be deported in probably a week, or two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I mean, in six weeks, almost 500,000 Hungarian Jews were deported from the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">You can imagine that 160 to 180,000 Jews in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , were concentrated, could be deported in a matter of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">But we were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And that saved our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">What happened after this was a—a little miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Eichmann left. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">He was frustrated by this inaction by the Hungarian government. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And he also knew that things were not going well in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">What we didn’t know, but he did, and many of the Nazis did, 1s that the Hungarian government started again some negotiations with the western allies and even with the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And these negotiations, essentially, they wanted to manifest this — their good will. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">So the way they did it 1s they essentially replaced the November 13, 1997 government with a — a government of army officers, who were not as extreme. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you ever see Eichmann?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">ANSWER:  I did not personally see Eichmann, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">QUESTION:  Did you ever see Horthy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">ANSWER:  I have seen Horthy, yes, when I was a kid, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">QUESTION:  What did he appear to you to be like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">ANSWER:  Well, he was a handsome old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">He was — he was an [indecipherable] but he was a—a horseman, and he — he rode the white horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And we had a national holiday on the 20" of August, which was a holiday for the first king of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , Saint Steven. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And what I remember about — maybe I was six or seven when my father took me to this day — the — the Saint Steven’s day on the 20" of August was a great holiday, because his right hand was, as a miracle, was preserved. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Now, this man died a thousand years ago, and his right hand was the icon of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and they took this right hand and — and they took it all around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you know, there’s a whole procession. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And Horthy used to ride the horse, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And I remember this procession in the late 30s, when this had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And I saw him once after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">In 1938, if I remember, there was a huge, Catholic congress in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , where the pope came, and — or at least the man who became pope later, November 13, 1997 Pius the 12". </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And he spoke and Horthy was with him and I saw — I remember that I saw — this was a huge thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">He was not just a Catholic thing, he was everybody’s thing, and I saw Horthy that time again, the second time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">QUESTION:  Was he a hero to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="672">ANSWER:  He was not a hero to me, but he was not a villain, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">We knew that he had Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">We knew that his best poker partner was a Jewish industrialist my — by name of Goldberger(ph) and Weiss(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And his wife was connected to — there was a rumor that his wife had Jewish blood in her. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And that — we knew that his older son, married to a— a countess who was very much pro-Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">In fact, it turned out that — that she was working for the — the — the anti-Nazi resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And she’s still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">She’s a very old lady now. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And we knew that — that Horthy, if he was not pro-Jewish, he had friends, and he was not the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">He was not a hero, but he —as I said, he was not a villain either. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So going back to my story, we did not know, but we were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">After Horthy changed the government, things started to be a little easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Up until then, we only had like one or two hours where we could go out to the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">We were — we had a — given a couple of more hours of freedom, free time to go to the <span class="DLF">street</span> , to <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , for example.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">QUESTION:  What did you do inside the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> when you couldn’t go out? </span><span class="sentence" id="687">November 13, 1997</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, I was a lonely child, I — I didn’t have people to play with, so I played with my toys, and I was with the relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">They played cards, and I sort of sat next to my mother, and they had a— a game which they played every — a day, which was a sort of a superstition. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I — I don’t know if this game exists here, I guess it does. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">There is a [indecipherable] like a — a [indecipherable] with alphabets, with — with various ABC and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And what they do is they put a — an upside-down — a turned water glass, and they put their hands on and then supposedly a ghost comes and then pushes the glass and then spells out things and tells you your answers, you know, and most of the questions were, are we going to have an air raid tonight, you know, and of course we didn’t need to know the answer, we knew that it was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">But, you know, some people believed this, and we played that every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">That was a—a-—a game we played. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And we also, as I said, we played various — various games, word games, and I was sort of tolerated by the adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And I was trying to be a fly on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> most of the time, and didn’t do too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Wasn’t very happy and wasn’t very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I was reading a lot actually, I had a few books and I was reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I — I was — my favorite author was Jules Verne, and since I was all [indecipherable] up, I was reading about “20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,” and Five Weeks in the A-Air — Air Balloon, and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">I — I was always interested in — in adventures, and it was certainly an ironic time to read about those November 13, 1997 adventures. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And that’s what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And the summer went relatively fast, and — and it was lucky, because my father’s unit was brought back from the western parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , where they built fortifications to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">And my father was lucky because his commander was a decent man again. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Turned out that his — the commander’s fiancée was Jewish, and she lived in our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And the commander sort of looked the other way when half of his brigade sort of disappeared every evening, and reappeared every early morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">This was strictly illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">If a man was caught, he — under the circumstances, he would be subject to immediate execution. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Nevertheless, my father, about two, three times a week, took this chance and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> late at night, after curfew, and Mr. Vargo(ph) let him in. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Mr. Vargo(ph) got a few hundred pengés for this act, but nevertheless, he took a chance too. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">My father came in for a few hours, and then he went back early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So it was happiness that we have seen him at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And again, the eternal optimist said well, 1t couldn’t last long. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">The Russians were already fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">We knew the Romanians were out of the war already, and — and they know — we also knew that, you know, the war couldn’t last for more than a week or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I mean, the Russians were less than a hundred kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">So the October 15 rolled around, and October 15 was a very tumultuous and very important day. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">That was the day when Horthy declared that <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was November 13, 1997 becoming a neutral country, and that <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> essentially threw in the towel. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Well, I can tell you that 1t was unreal for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">We heard this on loudspeakers, and we went out, and we ra — ripped al — our yellow stars off, and we were absolutely hysterical. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">But the people around us were yelling down from their <span class="DLF">windows</span> that we are just a little bit too premature, we are a little bit too happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And they said, well, you dirty Jews, don’t think that you will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And indeed, they were more prophetic that we realized, because in a couple of hours, the — this — this coup was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">In fact, with German help, the most extreme Nazis, Hungarian Nazis took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">The ar — the Arrow Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And we heard Mr. Vargo’s(ph) radio, he was nice enough to open his <span class="DLF">doors</span> so people could hear through the radio, when they were looking for Barakti(ph) Burger(ph), who was the extreme Nazi general to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> immediately to assume the — the — the command of the — the troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And we heard by the end of the day that Horthy was arrested and then that Szalasi became the head of the state and a new government was sworn in. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And this was the 15". </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Ten days later, all the women between the ages of — Jewish women, ages of 18 and 40 were ordered to come to a <span class="DLF">soccer field</span> , which was the Kishauk(ph) soccer field. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And this impacted my aunts, Elizabeth, who was 29, with a baby of three years old, and Yoli(ph), who was 38, with a cousin of mine, who was my age, 11 — 10 — 10 and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And my mother was 43, so she was too old to go, but they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And November 13, 1997 10,000 young women went. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">The women who had children were excused, and Yoli(ph) left, but Elizabeth didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">She was too tired, she was just — she said, I — I — I just give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And the — she was one of the ones who were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">At that time they had no transportation except to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">They had these death marches. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And she made the death march, we knew that she did, because her friends who survived told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">She got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrick</span> , and she died a few days before liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">She was 29. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Her baby daughter, Susan, was hidden by an aunt who was not Jewish, who was a wife of my uncle, Lazlo Pick. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Now Lazlo Pick was one of the uncles who went to the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">He was a thin, skinny man, but he was a tenacious sports person. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And he walked the 800 miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">He just got back in March of 1944, just in time for the next round. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And he was to be deported in September, but he didn’t wait for that, he took his rucksack, left it and went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , where his wife, in an efficiency apartment not very much bigger than this one, hid him in a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">efficiency apartment</span> not very much bigger than this one, hid him in a closet for three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">And she also hid the baby, my cousin Susan, and they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">My father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the beginning of November, with the news that he got the 24 hours furlough, and that he is going — he wa — if he 1s going back next mon — next day in the morning, he 1s to go to the railroad station, and he knows that he was going to be taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , and he knows that he was going to be taken to Germany, and he was not about to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">He had a friend, and they had a plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">The plan was that they were going to my grandfather’s abandoned <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , November 13, 1997 which was in ruins, but the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> was in fairly good shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And they knew the war was going to be over in a week, so they would go there and they would just stick it out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And my father left, and we didn’t know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">This was the sixth of November. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">We didn’t know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">On the 22"4 of November, a — an army man came over and we were very surprised, I mean, you don’t see an army soldier coming to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And he came in and he wanted to talk to my mother and he handed her a note. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And the note said that — was a one sentence that said, you and George follow this soldier and come immediately where he will take you. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Well, my mother was unhappy about this, because she didn’t want to leave my grandmother and everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And — and — or the — the message was not to tell anybody anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And so we went, but my mother didn’t take anything except me with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And we went to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , which was a factory building on the other side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> <span class="BUILDING">factory building</span> on the other side of town, in a blue collar neighborhood, called <span class="DLF">Chango(ph) Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And it was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And the soldier took us there and we met my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">It turned out that this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was a camouflage place, where they had a bunch of Jews, Jewish men, hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">The outs — for the outside world this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for army uniforms, Hungarian army uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">My father was quite mad at us when he saw that we just came with nothing, and told us to go back immediately, and come the very same evening, come <span class="NPIP">hell</span> or high water. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">So my mother saw when November 13, 1997 — when — when she saw — when she saw that he was mad, we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">We got back and we were terribly rushed, because we had maybe a half an hour before curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And she threw in a couple of — she — the thing which she was most worried about were the family photos. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And she threw in a f— the family photos in a small bag, which I still have. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And she also put a little food in, and nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">While we were in the midst of this desperate packing, the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was raided by two teenage Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And they came in, one must not been — I don’t think one was more than 13 and the other one maybe 16 - 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">They had submachine guns with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And they went and they rampaged the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">They — they broke things, they stole things, they made a mess. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">They saw these little thing which my mother put together, this little bag, and threw it on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and stomped on it, and they terrorized everybody for a couple of hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">And then they finally left. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And this was after the curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">So my mother put everything back and begged Mr. Vargo(ph) to let us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Again, little money changed hands and Vargo(ph) let us out and we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And we got there — this was end of November, toward the end of November, so it was a short day, just like today. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And by six o’clock or so, it was quite late la — quite dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">We got there and my father was really relieved to see us, and told us how he got there, because we didn’t know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">So he told us that he went to this <span class="BUILDING">rendezvous place</span> with his friend, his name was Gargutzi(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And Gargutzi(ph) November 13, 1997 never showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">He was caught in a raid, and he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">So my father was in a panic, and went to a friend of his, by the name of Gaykis(ph), who was a Christian business associate, and told him that he needs to hide somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Well Gaykis(ph) told him that he would be happy to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">He gave him this address, it’s Changutca(ph) 6B address, and gave him a note. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Told him to — not to talk to anybody, just go there, hand the note to the commanding officer of this army — <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">My father did just that, and he handed the note to the soldier and — and the soldier took back the note to the army commander and then the <span class="DLF">door</span> opened and he was let in, and the army commander went to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">The army commander turned out to be a Jew who was a friend of my father’s, and who was playing this role. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">He was a spit and polished army — army commander uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And he told my father that 65 people who escaped from deportation are also there. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">They are all men, and he is welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And this was in the beginning of November. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Toward the middle of November, the man who heard the news — they were much better informed, of course, than us, that things are happening throughout <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they knew about the deportation of the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">They started to bring their families in. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">So my father also took this — sent a soldier who was a deserter — a real, bona fide soldier, but a deserter, to the note — with the note to my mother, and that’s how we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Well, my mother didn’t bring anything and so my father’s overcoat served for the November 13, 1997 next three months as our blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">We did not know what had happened, but this is what happened, the very next day: the Arrow Cross raiders came back, and took everybody from the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we lived, to the <span class="DLF">brickyards</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And at that point, Mr. Vargo(ph), who knew of a brother, my grandmothers had a — two sisters and a brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And a brother lived in a Swedish house, Swedish —</p>

<p>QUESTION:  Safe house.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="803">ANSWER:  A safe <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , correct, safe <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was a — was saved by Wallenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And Mr. Vargo(ph) ran to this man, by the name of Beyla(ph) Kornhaus — Beyla Spitzer(ph), and tell him that — told him that his three sisters were in the <span class="BUILDING">brick factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And Spitzer was able to get in touch with Wallenberg, who went and took the three ladies, and one lady’s daughter with her — with him, and took — took — took these four people to the safe <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="806">The other ones were deported, and — by foot, and none of them came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">We would be among those who were deported, and who would have been, of course, the victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">This we found out later, after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">In the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we now were in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , we had about 120 - 130 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">They had a bunch of kids, young women and 1n a few days we found out that there was a group of young people who were running around in Nazi uniforms, but they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And they had a — a group of five or six people who went to the deportation trains and to the <span class="DLF">roads</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">deportation trains</span> and to the roads, to snatch some people back. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">They had papers, wi November 13, 1997 — which were forgeries, which said that such and such people would have to be brought back to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> because they wanted to interrogate them. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And this way they brought in more than 50 people back from the <span class="DLF">road</span> , who were already to certain death, mostly — mostly young women, and some young men, but mostly women. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And so in the next week or so, the number of people went to about 170. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">We had about 22 kids, some of them were younger than I, and it was a — a great camaraderie. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I mean, since — since the early spring that year, in 1944, I haven’t been with kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And it was a lot of fun, and what was fun about it is that this — this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> had a bunch of machines, big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">textile machines</span> and we were av — able to explore these, and a few of us were curious, particularly one fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">His name was Foti(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Foti(ph) Yonchee(ph) and John Foti(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And he was my age, and he — we went on, and we played with these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> and it was just a lot of adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">We also found that there was a <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> , or sort of a <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> , which had a — a lot of hay. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And the hay was important because attached to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , there was a horse, and a —and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Horse and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And the hay was, of course, his food, horse’s food. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">But what we found out, which was very interesting and uk — unexpected 1s that one of the young men who was in this resistance told us that under the hay there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">personnel motorcar</span> , which they use to rescue people. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">End of Tape Two, Side A November 13, 1997 Beginning Tape Two, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with George Pick. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">This is tape number two, side B.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Okay, so what we found out is that under the hay was this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and they gave us the permission to go into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and it was, of course, very exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">This — this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was an early <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Skoda</span> , model 1930s. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And at that time, in order to start the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , you had a piece of — a steel rod you had to put in in the front and make it, you know, move it around. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">But these people told us, and I am sure this was a fib, that in fact — in fact that’s thing was not a part of the starter, but it was a machine gun built into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and that this would be used in case something happens here. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And we believed that, it was a good — good fib, and it was certainly an interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Unfortunately the reality was a little less interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">What had happened is that on the second of December, we heard a — a very powerful knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and there were only f— a few seconds before we heard running steps. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">We — our — our <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> were on the second floor, second story of this <span class="NPIP">place</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , second story of this place. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">It was really camouflaged as work rooms, but by the time we reached this number of people, there was not enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , so they build these multiple — actually three story</p>

<p>ANSWER:  <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Bunks</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> Bunks</span> , I guess you can call them. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And they brought the hay from downstairs and we — we Slept on the hay and we used the army uniforms, we had several hundred of those, as blankets and pillows, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And we were in a middle <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , and I remember the [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you ba — did you stay with the children, or did you sleep with the children, or with your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="839">ANSWER:  No, I slept with my mother and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">The families stayed together. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Underneath there was another family with a little girl I remember, her name was Onchee(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="842">She was about two or three years old and she made a racket and she made her grandpa — Papa, very, very mad all the time, and she knew how to push his buttons. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And it was hilarious, I mean, it was really funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Very close by, there was a young lady, young woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Her name was Cotto(ph) Ferhier(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And she was a — she was married, she was 22 years old, and we got very good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">She — she was patient enough with me and I talked to her about my stories I read and all these things, and I was 10 going on 30, and we really became very good friends and my mother and father didn’t mind that at all, because of course, they didn’t have to babysit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And that was another friendship, but she was more interested in another fellow, who was a young man by the name of Bondi(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And Bondi(ph) was one of the — the refugees there, the — the one who was able to escape from deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">November 13, 1997 And Bondi(ph) one day, and this was the very end of November, I think the 30", got very, very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And he got high fever and he was delirious. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And the committee who ran this <span class="NPIP">place</span> had a real dilemma, they didn’t know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">If they bring in somebody from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , you know, they may jeopardize 129 — 69 people, and if they don’t, they may have Bondi(ph) dead within a day or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Well, they decided the next day, when Bondi’s(ph) condition became worse, that they were going to bring somebody in. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And — and they brought a Christian doctor in late at night, and he gave him sulfur drugs, it turned out that it was an infection. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">And in a day or so, he got better. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">The date is very important, this was the first of December. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">In the morning of the second, we heard the running steps, and as we were trying to scramble for some shelter, we saw five men running in with submachine guns and yelling and screaming us and saying that we know who you are, you are just a bunch of dirty Jews who are trying to — to hide here, and we are the police, the Nazi state police. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">This was the gest — the Hungarian Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And they sorted out the men to one side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and women and children to the other and we thought that this was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I mean, there was just no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Within the few seconds of confusion, one man, John dove out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and into another <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="863">It was like six or seven feet, and he really jumped, and he crashed through a — a — a <span class="DLF">glass door</span> — glass enclosure. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And his luck was that it was a haystack underneath, so he November 13, 1997 got into the haystack. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And they ran after him, they tried to push the haystack, they couldn’t find him. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">But we were captured, and we thought that this was going to be the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">But for a while nothing happened, and about 20 or 30 minutes later, the detectives, one of the leaders of the detectives came out of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and made the following startling statement, that henceforth we are under their protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And we just couldn’t figure out what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">There was only one arrest which they made, and that was a na— aman by the name of Kormus(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Kormus(ph) was the — the leader of the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Not the commander, but the real leader, the organizer. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I didn’t know much about Kormus(ph), but I found out later what — who he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">They took him and they took us, oh, 10,000 dollars in cash, which by sheer luck was there, because there were a number of extremely rich people in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">So in other words, they bribed these detectives. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And they left with Kormus(ph) and the money, but they left us behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">After the war I found out that they took Kormus(ph) and they — they tortured him for two days because they knew that this, our <span class="NPIP">place</span> , was not the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">In fact, it was a network of four <span class="NPIP">places</span> , all of which Kormus(ph) ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">They knew of three, our <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and another two. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And what happened is Kormus(ph) was betrayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">We thought that the doctor did — betrayed us, it was not the doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">It was aman by name of Althurdi(ph), who hid Kormus(ph) and his family for months. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And the speculation was that he was either blackmailed, or he didn’t get November 13, 1997 enough money, but he betrayed Kormus(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="883">He knew of three <span class="NPIP">places</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kormus(ph</span> ) could have been, and he knew of a fourth <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but he did not know the address of the fourth <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="884">So when he — when Kormus(ph) was betrayed, they raided three of the four <span class="NPIP">places</span> , Kormus(ph) happened to be in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="885">But the fourth <span class="NPIP">place</span> they didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">The fourth <span class="NPIP">place</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in another part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> with 350 Jewish slave laborers who were essentially also hiding there. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">But they, the slave laborers were armed, and they had a mission there. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">They were armed, and their mission was that they would save the utility companies of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="889">The paper said — they were all in army uniforms — their paper said that they would be the last one to stay, to blow up these utilities, the gas — gas company, the — the wa — the waterworks and so forth, and the electric company. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">That was the paper which said, but the real mission was to, in fact, save these utilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And every day they were trained like soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Every night on the other hand, they we — they had a little <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> underneath and they forged papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And they worked with the Zionists and they worked with our little group, and they were part of the Hungarian Jewish resistance, and Kormus(ph) was the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">So Kormus(ph) — they — they knew Kormus(ph) knew about this and they tortured him. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">He did not speak, and because he didn’t show up for two days, they knew in the fourth <span class="NPIP">place</span> , that things were bad, so they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">They — they — they — they couldn’t accomplish their mission, but they November 13, 1997 were all safe, they were able to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And then Kormus(ph) was sentenced to death, and they took him to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> <span class="RIVER">Danube</span> , but he was able to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">He was very sick because of the fact that he — they tortured him, but he escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">He was able to hide, and he survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">The other two <span class="NPIP">places</span> which were raided, were not as lucky as we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">They had not many rich people there and they were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">One was deported on foot to — to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they all died. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And the second <span class="NPIP">part</span> was taken to political headquarters, and they — they were among the ones who were sentenced and 70 of them were taken to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> <span class="RIVER">Danube</span> <span class="BUILDING">political headquarters</span> , and they — they were among the ones who were sentenced and 70 of them were taken to the Danube, and only Kormus(ph) was able to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">The rest of them were shot into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> <span class="RIVER">Danube</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="905">So our group was essentially the — out of the three groups, our group was the only one who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">After this happened, the committee who ran the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> decided that the 22 children were not safe, so they decided to take us from — ranging from age of six months to 11 years, I was among the oldest. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And one lady who — who had the six months old son, I think, they took us to a— a Red Cross building which was in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross building</span> which was in the middle of the city. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">We took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> and the soldier brought us to the <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And the idea was that this was a protected <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , we would be fed there and we would be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">That was the theory. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">The practice was that when we got there, there were about three or 400 children, crying, hungry, dirty and maybe a half a dozen adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">I didn’t like the <span class="NPIP">place</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">November 13, 1997</p>
<p>QUESTION:  When you said this was a — another protected <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , protected by whom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">ANSWER:  By the Red Cross, Swiss Red Cross building, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="915">They were the — they had about 30 <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> throughout <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which were run by the Swiss Red Cross, like the Swedish buildings, this — but this was not within that <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> <span class="BUILDING">Swedish buildings</span> , this — but this was not within that enclosure, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">There was a— what they called an international ghetto, where the Swiss, the Swedes, the [indecipherable] and the Spanish had rented <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , about 32 <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">international ghetto</span> , where the Swiss, the Swedes, the [indecipherable] and the Spanish had rented buildings, about 32 buildings. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">This was 1n a part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and they were all concentrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">That’s where my grandmother and my grand-aunts and uncle were. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">The Red Cross buildings were throughout the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> <span class="BUILDING">Red Cross buildings</span> were throughout the city, they were essentially Swiss protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Not very well, as you will hear in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">But at the time that I got there they were protected, and they were concentrating children there. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Now, the idea was that there were adults who would supervise these children, they would bring hoo — food and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Well, the — that was the theory. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">The practice was that the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was almost empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I was put in with a friend of mine, into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we had about 35 children of my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , we were sleeping on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and we were told that there is no food for the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Well, I wandered around and I was crying, and I met a friend of mine from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, who was there with his sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">I knew him, his name is Mike Vairmas(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="929">He now lives here in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And he was telling me that he wa — he just came in a few days earlier and they are thinking about leaving the November 13, 1997 <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , escaping, because they haven’t gotten any food there since they came. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">So, a young girl saw me there crying, and asked me why I was crying, and I was saying I was hungry and I was lonely for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">This young girl has a boyfre — had a boyfriend who was in a Nazi uniform, and who told me that he would be more than happy to take me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Well, I knew that that was not the right answer, and I knew that I had to escape now, cause I knew that if this man would take a — take me back to where we are hiding, you know, he would betray us. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">So John Foti(ph) and I decided that in the very next morning, we are going to take off. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was locked from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , so we couldn’t just walk out. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And the next morning when the employees came, there was a kindly lady who came and we asked her to take us out so that we could buy some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And as she took us out, we ran away from her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">QUESTION:  Wasn’t that a very brave decision? </span><span class="sentence" id="939">You’re 11 years — 10 years old, to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="940">ANSWER:  It was a brave decision, but it — we had no choice, because if we went back, the Nazi would recognize us, would take us to where my father and mother and the other people were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">I didn’t want to take that chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">The chance was that they would catch us somewhere, because they were looking for kids too, and of course we didn’t wear our — our yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">That was the chance I had to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">It took us a couple of hours to — to get back. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">We were sort of ducking various little November 13, 1997 groups of Nazis who were patrolling the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="946">We bought a newspaper, which we pretended to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">We took a number of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> to go, and we knew where — where the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was, so we had to change like three times, and we got back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">My mother couldn’t believe that I did come back and we came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">We were the only two kids who — who did come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">After the war I found out that about three days later, the Nazis raided the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and they took the children to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> <span class="RIVER">Danube</span> and they shot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And my friend Mike and his sister escaped just a day or so earlier, but not the rest of them; the rest of them all died. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">So here we were, this was, I think maybe the 10" of December. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">A few days after this, two policemen showed up in our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and told us that the detectives sent out — sent them to let us know that we are under suspicion by some of the Nazis, who live in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , and they are about to report this suspicious <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and people. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And that they da — they suggested that we should follow them, they would take us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="955">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> was established at the very end of November. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And the people who were still in the — the yellow stone — yellow starred <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were taken to the — to the <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Now, many of the yellow starred <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were raided, and many of the people already were deported, but in the middle of December, which is what — what was, there were — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> was almost completely surrounded by Russian troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And so the Nazis decided that they would concentrate the Jews who are left in November 13, 1997 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> into a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which was the — used to be the <span class="INT_SPACE">Jewish quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And then they would do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And so, on the 14" of December, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was already established and these policemen told us that they would go ahead, we would be behind them, they would not look back, and nothing else was said. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">Well, of the 150 people roughly, only 65 arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="962">The rest sort of evaporated along the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">My father decided that we have nowhere to hide, so we went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="964">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , as I mentioned, was in a very poor section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="965">The center of it was a square, Klauzal square, and in that square, or one part of the square was a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> <span class="DLF">Klauzal square</span> , and in that square, or one part of the square was a market. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">They took us to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , where the Nazis — a number of Nazis were there, Hungarian Nazis, told us that, if you have any jewelry, money, they are going to do a body search, and if they find anything, they’Il shoot us. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">There was a dead body to sh — to prove the point. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And we didn’t have anything, but a couple of people did, and they would throw the — the jewelry into the <span class="DLF">sewer</span> rather than giving it to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">Of the 63 of us who got there, we were separated into several groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">The group which my father and I — my mother and I stayed with were about 20 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">We were just taken to the other side of the square, is Klauzal square seven, a three story old <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="972">Turned out that this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> housed a — the remnants of a <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span> , old age Jewish home, brought in, and the first two stories — floors, were quite chock full of November 13, 1997 people, but the third story was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">So they gave us two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> there, and it was dirty and no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And I remember that after — the day after we arrived, my father, who was always enterprising, he was looking around and he found a piece of bread, which must have been six months old. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And bugs were jumping all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> out of it, but he said, that’s okay, because we’ll toast it and then we can eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">That’s precisely what we did, somehow we toasted it, bugs all got fried and then we ate a piece of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">That was the food for that particular day. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">People were not very choosy at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">My father also went around to see what — what was the situation in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="980">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was — th-the <span class="REGION">area</span> originally was an <span class="REGION">area</span> for about 12,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">By the time we got there, they had about 40,000 people living there, and at its peak they had 70,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">So you can imagine that there were not — there was not much <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="983">QUESTION:  Did you feel older than your age by that time, because of what you had been going through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="984">ANSWER:  Absolutely yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">I didn’t feel like a kid at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">I mean, all these things age — age people pretty rapidly, and — and I remember that, you know, walking around with my mother on the — on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and seeing people in — in terrible physical and mental condition, and dirty and broken down, and it was — it was very depressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">November 13, 1997</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did you feel any responsibility for your mother or your father, or did you feel that they were still taking care of you? </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Had the — was it still a parent-child relationship?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="989">ANSWER:  It was still a parent-child relationship, essentially, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And my father was not a part of — you know, he was a take charge person, he was not a person who would — who would break down. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">In — in fact, you know, he was my hero, because he was very brave man, as you will hear what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">What he did is he looked around for possibilities, and one possibility was to join the ghetto police. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">Now, the ghetto police in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> was a very different from the ghetto police in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> or any of these other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">This is now the middle of December in 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">The Russians are completely surrounding this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="996">The ghetto police’s mission 1s different. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">The ghetto police’s mission, ridiculous as it may sound, was a defensive mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">They’re supposed to persuade or — or — or fight off the Nazis coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And the means for that was a nightstick and a — and a Swiss beret and a — a armband, a white armband which says ghetto police in three different languages; Hungarian, German and Russian [indecipherable] languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And he had an I.D. card saying he was ghetto police. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Well, one of his lucky strokes was that he found, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we stayed, a hardhat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">These — you know, what — what the — November 13, 1997</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Construction workers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1003">ANSWER:  Construction workers wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Actually, the firefighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And he always wo-wore that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">That saved his life more than once. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And the reason why he want to — or wanted to join the ghetto police force was that the ghetto police had double rations, and he wanted to bring the ration <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">The policeman’s life were very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">They were on patrol 12 - 14 hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And as I said, their mission was — their main mission was to try to fight off the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Well, you don’t fight off people with machine guns when they come in, and of course, they couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Many of them died because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">They tried to be polite to the Nazis, who simply let a—a slug of —a slug into them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">There — a few days after we moved in, at night, we heard this tremendous noise and a huge crash. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">We found out that the shell, an artillery shell was shot into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">We don’t know who shot it, but it landed in the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> from where we were, and the people who were there, died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">And it was a <span class="DLF">wall</span> away from where we were, where my father, mother and I were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">I got hysterical and I said, I’m not staying up here, and my mother and I and Cotto(ph), who was with us, the — the young lady who we met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chango(ph</span> ), the three of us moved down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">The <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> was very deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">It used to be the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> of wood maker and it was covered with wood saw, and we just slept there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">They had a couple of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">workbenches</span> there and I never moved out of that <span class="NPIP">place</span> after that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">I never November 13, 1997 needed to move out because in about two days, the — which was Christmas day, the siege of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> began, and everybody moved on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">The food supply was catastrophic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">We had people who were old — and I mean old — battle hardened Hungarian Jewish slave laborers, the remnants of the people who were taken out in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">About a half a dozen of them ended up in our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">A number of them were very religious Jews, and they were Hassids and they were praying all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">A number of them were not too religious, but none of them were willing to risk their lives at that point to bring food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">There were food available about a <span class="DLF">block</span> or a block and a half from where we lived, but somebody had to go there and get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">My father always volunteered, but he was not enough just by himself, and a few people went and some got hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And so our food supply, because of this, was very precarious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">People knew that the war couldn’t la — end up — I mean, how long could you live like this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">There was no water, there was no electricity, gas, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">What we had was about 200 people in a small <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , which had no electricity, with a couple of slit <span class="DLF">windows</span> eight feet high or nine feet high, and a couple of cans of floor wax. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">I remember that I contributed one of my shoelaces as wicks and we put — put it in the can and that was the — the light which 200 people had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">My father — I haven’t s — you know, I — after the siege begun, my father was mostly out, he — he didn’t come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">One time I remember when he came in, he came in November 13, 1997 only for — for a few minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">He came in with the good news that he found his own parents in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and his parents were in reasonably good shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1038">QUESTION:  What were the sanitary conditions like in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1039">ANSWER:  Well, the sanitary conditions were — were horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">What they had to do was to dig a — a <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> in the middle of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">And they had some old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed sheets</span> , and they got a couple of pieces of wood and you know, you sort of leaned against it when you had to do your thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">But the stench was unbearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And then, because we were very close together, people started to have lice, and because we were close proximity, everybody got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And the way we — we lived there, we — we raided the bil — the upper part of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and got the — the <span class="DLF">doors</span> out and put the <span class="DLF">doors</span> down and the people essentially slept on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">We still had my father’s overcoat, who would have really needed it in his forays in — <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , but he didn’t have it because we were using it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1046">QUESTION:  How did you keep yourself clean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1047">ANSWER:  We didn’t, we couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">There was some little water, but 1t was negligible, and most people just gave up on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">And you know, for the last two weeks, two or three weeks, it was just nominal washing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Some people tried to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">Interestingly enough, the — the more well educated were the ones who sort of gave up; the least well educated ones, who tried to keep their — their cleanliness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">And it was a — 1t was November 13, 1997 an interesting Darwinian selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">One of the things which happened is that old people died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">They starved to death and we found them in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And 1n a lull of fighting, a few men volunteered to bring them out of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and threw them on a pile of dead bodies which were piling up in the middle of the square. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">I went —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Was it — was it easier for you by then to see dead bodies, since you had seen so much?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1057">ANSWER:  No, it wasn’t easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">I think it — it — it — 1t never was — was easier for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">I — I knew that those people were alive a day before, and I knew them, I spoke to them, some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">I could never take this for granted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And I remember once when I — when the lull in the fighting sort of persisted for an hour, I came out and I looked out and I saw this — this hill of bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And I knew that if something will not happen very soon, we would all e-end up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">I did not — did not think that any one of us would survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And then January came, and we were all lethargic, we were sort of sitting there, weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And tha — at that point there was very few who had any spark left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And on the fourth of January, a group of about 30 or 35 young ladies, young women were brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">Turned out that they were from Wallenberg’s <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Wallenberg was very concerned that he could not really protect people any more at November 13, 1997 that point, and he decided that many of the people who were still alive there — his <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were raided by the Nazis — he decided —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What di — what did you — what had you heard about Raoul Wallenberg previous to this date?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1069">ANSWER:  Very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">This was the first time that I heard of his name, from these people who came from his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I-I — most of the things which I knew about him, I learned after the World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">I knew that Raoul Wallenberg was trying to save people, and it wasn’t just Wallenberg incidentally, but other people in organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">We knew about the Swedes, we knew about the Swiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">We had, for example what they call schutz passes, safe passages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">The — they had forgeries by the hundreds of thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">Everybody had a couple of them in the pockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">We didn’t know whether they were real or forged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">At that point, sometimes it helped, sometimes it didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1079">QUESTION:  Did your family have any schutz passes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1080">ANSWER:  Yeah, we had — we had schutz passes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">My mother had them, I had, my father had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1082">QUESTION:  How — how did they get them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1083">ANSWER:  I—I guess at that point, they were given. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">They were given away by Jewish organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">I sa— I’m sad to say that some of the — the Jews did not give them November 13, 1997 away for nothing, they — they made money on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">We were — we didn’t have very much money, we never had Swedish passports, which was expensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">So we had the Swiss, which was cheap, or nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">But it wasn’t — it really didn’t matter most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">I mean, most of the Nazis really didn’t look at the paper, they — they threw away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">But sometimes you never knew whether it had or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">So — for some people it had sometimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1092">QUESTION:  Did you ever have to show yours?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1093">ANSWER:  We never had to show ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">We had it in our pocket, but we never had to show ours.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1095">QUESTION:  Did your parents try to get into one of those safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1096">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">As I mentioned to you, our — our — our story was that my f— my mother and I stayed in the — in the re — in the yellow star <span class="BUILDING">house</span> until we went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">And the only people who went into the safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were my grandparents — my — my grandmother actually, and my grandmother’s sisters who, through the good <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> of Raoul Wallenberg were able to —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  I meant, did they try to get into any of the safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1099">ANSWER:  No, they did not, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">Not that I know of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">Remember, there was very little communication between people at this point, there were no telephones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">Each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , each yellow star house was sort of an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">We did not know what happened to November 13, 1997 fair — friends, relatives, anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And we did not know what was going on in the outside world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">So at this point, this was the first time we knew about, or I f-found out about safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">I found out that these safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were no longer safe, and these people were brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">They were better fed than we were, but they were very frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">And we squeezed them in as everybody — at that point it was not that much of a squeeze because most of the older people died already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">So this was the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Tenth of January rolled around, and we were even weaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">A young SS soldier came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">He was surveying the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">He told us that the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is mined, that we will not survive, and just forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">They will not allow the Jews to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">The Russians were very close, but before the Russians would get there, they would blow them up — blow the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">Turns out that — that the real plan was even more sinister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">I do not know whether the — this — this was really a fake Story or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">End of Tape Two, Side B November 13, 1997 Beginning Tape Three, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with George Pick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">This is tape number three, side A.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  The — the real plan was more sinister than the one which the soldier disclosed to us, namely that they would blow up the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">The real plan was to massacre us on — for the 16" of January, there was a massacre in plan, 500 SS, a couple of hundred Hungarian police. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">The number of Hungarian Nazis would come in with submachine guns, and would line us up essentially, and — and mow us down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">It turned — turned out that fortunately, Wallenberg found out about it on the 15", and he sent a message to the SS general. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">His name was Schmidhuber, that if this happens, he would personally guarantee that Schmidhuber would be hung. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">Apparently Schmidhuber was a middle-aged man and he was now concerned about his own welfare. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And he called — called this action off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">That obviously saved the people, my life, my father’s, mother’s, my relatives and the 7,000 people who were still alive in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">This was on the 15" - 16". </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">There was one little girl in our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , her name was Alice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">She was about eight years old, and she was a weak little kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">She was not very alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">She had a mother, and a grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">The mother was diabetic, and the grandmother was also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">And she came sometimes to play with me, but I didn’t like her that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">This day, on the 17", she came not just to my mother, but November 13, 1997 to everybody to beg for some food for her mother, who — who was in a diabetic shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">We had very little, namely and specifically, we had about a quarter of a pound of sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">As I mentioned earlier, when we left our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the Jewish re — yellow star <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to go into hiding, my mother took very little food with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">This food was shepherded along since November, now it’s January. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">The la — the — the — a month of food which is left in that little bag 1s fa — is a half a pound of sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">My mother kept it for me because she felt that maybe a few sugar cubes would save my life if — if it all comes down to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">So my mother refused to give Alice any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">This was the 17". </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">On the 18" of January in the morning — on the evening of the 17, my father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he decided to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">On the 18" there was a strange quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">We didn’t know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">It wasn’t as quiet for — for weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">I mean, this was a 24 hour a day artillery duel and bombing raid and we didn’t know how much was left over of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And all of a sudden it was — was strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">So somebody climbed up to that slit window, about nine feet about the — the floor of the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> <span class="DLF">slit window</span> , about nine feet about the — the floor of the basement and saw some strange boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">They were not Nazi boots, they were Russian boots, and we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">There was no elation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">We vid — we really even didn’t say anything to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">It was fear that the Nazis would come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Was indecision what to do next. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">The one thing we found out is that Alice’s mother and grandmother were both dead, and my mother felt terribly guilty for the November 13, 1997 next 47 years of her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Nobody could tell her that she was saving the food to her son, that was a choice between somebody whom she didn’t know, and her own son, and there was really no choice in the matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">She felt still guilty til the day — day of her death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">I remember that some of the younger people evaporated first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">They didn’t ask, they didn’t say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">We didn’t know what happened to the people whom we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">My father and mother decided that, around noontime, that it’s time for us to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">Both my mother and father were so weak that the little suitcase which we had, which contained a half a pound of sugar and the family’s pictures, they couldn’t carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">I was the one who carried them, I was the — the strongest one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">My father, who was 43 years old, looked like 70. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And in his two or three weeks of patrol, he lost three of his partners, and he was more dead than alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And then he — we Started to walk out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , that was not — not an easy walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">There were very few <span class="DLF">walkways</span> there, half of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">We heard the shrapnel zipping and making this awful noise above our heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">The artillery fire was going on, the — the siege of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> was still going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">It took us three hours to get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we decided, like homing pigeons, to go back to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from which we were thrown out by the Nazis in June of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">We went back, it took us three hours, two and a half miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">We saw, in that journey, many dead bodies, many dead horses, and one live Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">Which was almost ludicrous because this man November 13, 1997 was singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">He was singing, he wa — must have been drunk, but he — he had a happy face, he was smiling and singing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">And we looked at him as if he were crazy, instead of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">Maybe he was the ones — the only sane people in that — person in that whole — whole mad, maddening scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">And as we were walking, these shrapnels were hitting <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , and whole <span class="DLF">walls</span> came down, tumbling in front of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">I mean, we were in mortal danger, we — we were crazy to walk there, but we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">And we walked through the city park, and we were held up by a small group of Russians, who wanted us to, for all other things, break up the ice on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> <span class="DLF">city park</span> , and we were held up by a small group of Russians, who wanted us to, for all other things, break up the ice on the sidewalk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">I mean, breaking up the ice, and he gave us these ice picks to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">My father couldn’t lift it, you know, and he finally said well, forget it, and they gave us a loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">That was the first loaf of bread we have seen for more than a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">It was — was a square loaf of bread, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And they just let us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And we stumbled <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and it was maybe four, five in the afternoon by the time we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">And the man whom we met first was Mr. Dudek(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">Mr. Dudek(ph) was the man who was giving my father the paper under which he was able to work for years, and who also hid a large suitcase full of food, which we left with him in June, and which he gave back to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">I remember the suitcase was a green suitcase, 1t was a canvas, but it was full of canned food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">He didn’t take any. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">But the rest of the people who lived there were rather frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">They looked at us as if we were ghosts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">Not November 13, 1997 just because of our physical appearance, but because of their bad conscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">Here these Jews came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">Now what will happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">There were — we knew about those extreme Nazis, Mr. Drexler(ph), who was — who was boasting about his adventures with the Hassidic Jews whose — whose beard he cut off and whose stomach he filled with — with pork. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">And some others, who were no less guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">They thought they will — that we were going to denounce them to the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">We were too tired, too sick to — too nothing to — to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">The miracle which happened to us was that a few hours later my — my maternal grandmother came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">Turned out that she was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And revenge was the furthest from our minds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">My grandmother was born in what is now <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , so she spoke the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">Russian troops came down, everybody was frightened of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">We found out that they came a few days earlier, raped a few women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">But my grandmother spoke their language and they were very, very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">And I remember that Mr. Dudek(ph) made room for us, and on the evening of the 18" of January, we s — we went to sleep in another <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , in another part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and the siege of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> was still on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">In fact, it was still on for more than a month, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> was still defended by the Nazis for a month after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">The life came back slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">The first thing we tried to do is to get some food somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">My father found a rucksack somewhere and went out and scrounged for frozen potatoes, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">We had this suitcase full November 13, 1997 of food, which helped a great deal for the next few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">But of course it doesn’t — you know, I mean, we were — my father was like 90 pounds, my mother was like that too and my grandmother too, and so we really needed to eat something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">There was very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">There were no utilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Water came about because we were the fru — we had the ice, you know, in the — in the <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="1215">QUESTION:  What was your physical condition like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1216">ANSWER:  My physical condition was the best of the three of us, cause if there was food, I ate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">| was weak, but maybe not as weak as my mother and father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And I probably bounced back in a couple of weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">We lived in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> there, and we were trying to find some other arrangements. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">As the end of February rolled around and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> was liberated, people were free to move back up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Our old <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was occupied; they gave it to another family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">But the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> next door, which was the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> of the Surka’s(ph), the man who was a professional soldier and whose two daughters I used to play with, they went to the west, they left, and their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">So Mr. Dudek(ph), the super, suggested that we would go and occupy that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">At that point it was like catcher’s catch can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">A number of <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> were also burned out by shells. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">That particular <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was in fairly good shape, so we went up and we occupied it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">Many months later, the Surkas November 13, 1997 came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">There was a law by that time that if somebody occupied an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for more than a certain number of months, they were the owners of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">So the Surkas(ph) couldn’t have a claim. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">They were a sad lot when they came back and I felt very sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">The yo — the older daughter died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">They went to the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">The father was a Soldier, they got liberated and they came back, and then they disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">I don’t know whether they left <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> or not, but at that time — this was in May or June of 1945, and that was the last time I saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">Our next door neighbors who lived in number five, they stayed and — and most of the neighbors who — who — whom we knew before the war, stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">There were some new neighbors, some people left, but all in all, we had about 20 <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> in this <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> , about 15 of them were familiar faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">So what happened next? </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">In March, the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> opened, and my mother and father and I decided that I’m going to go to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">It opened in the — what used to be the rabbinic seminary, the old <span class="BUILDING">building</span> <span class="BUILDING">rabbinic seminary</span> , the old building which was in <span class="DLF">Aboni(ph) Street</span> was not given back at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">And people somehow, and I don’t know how, they got the news that it — <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ’s garin — going to be open, life is going to start again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">In the beginning, in March, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> , so it was like an hour and a half walk each way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">My mother —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Was the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">November 13, 1997</p>
<p>ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">In the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">We lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zuglo</span> , which is sort of <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">Say was about a good three miles, three and a half miles from where the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">So every morning we got up fairly early, and my mother and I — my mother took my hand and we walked to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">And every — and then she waited for me in front, and then when it — <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was ended, she took me back, we had the same walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">And my mother became such a familiar face that the — the teachers all knew her and they invited her and then sort of she said — there were some mothers, not all of them were like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">But some of the mothers whose sons were all — whose — this was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> for boys, <span class="BUILDING">boys’ gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">We had a <span class="BUILDING">girls’ gymnasium</span> also, but this was the <span class="BUILDING">boys’ gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And so we started out fairly large, we had about 72 students in my class, two [indecipherable] classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">I was happy to see some friendly fa — and — faces from the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">But we found out, very sadly, that the — the orphans did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">What happened to the orphans, one day they — they raided this <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> and took out those orphans who were my classmates, 10 of them, with the teacher and took them to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> <span class="RIVER">Danube</span> and they shot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">So they didn’t — they didn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">But many of our classmates who were in elementary school did, and — and we saw them — I saw them in the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> did, and — and we saw them — I saw them in the gymnasium. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">It was very primitive in the beginning, we didn’t have anything, it was just an empty <span class="BUILDING">school building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">And the educ — and th — and many of the teachers didn’t come back November 13, 1997 from deportation, or from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">They sort of trickled back throughout that — from March to June. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">That was a very truncated year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">It was supposed to start, of course, 1n September of ’44, end in June of ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">Well, it never started, but it ended in June of °45 anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">And by then, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcars</span> started to run, and by then life started to trickle back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">We got a telegram in early June, I believe, from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , from my uncle, the one who wanted to adopt me, telling us that they found us through the Red Cross somehow, and that they’ll happy that we are survive — that we survived, and th-that he and his wife had a son who was born in 1944, and they are fine and happy and we should write to them, and we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">And we started corresponding and this — they sen — they said they would send us papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">But my father decided against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">He felt that <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> is going to be a good <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">And indeed, after the war there were some possibilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">My father restarted his business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">It looked like there was going to be a democracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">People were — were having some hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">Many of the surviving Jews decided to join the communist party, my father and mother joined the social democrats. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">And some of the people were out for revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">Many of them decided to join the political police and they were after the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">Kormus(ph), for example survived, became a head of a <span class="BUILDING">people’s court</span> , and as such, his mission was to put away as many Nazis as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">And he accomplished it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">My father was not that kind, and my mother was November 13, 1997 neither, and we sort of tried to reconstruct whatever we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">We looked around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , we found that some of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was not do — too far from where it originated from, and we got it back from the neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">And we just tried to rebuild our lives, somehow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1281">QUESTION:  By that time, when you had gotten your strength back and had food and so forth and <span class="BUILDING">school</span> had started, by then did you feel free, and feel liberated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1282">ANSWER:  Ina sense, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">I think it took me a long time to really feel liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">Probably 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">I remember 1945, and I remember the first of May of 1945, which was a huge demonstration by the social democrats and the communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">And I remember the struggle, the political struggles.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1287">QUESTION:  You — you mean a May Day celebration?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1288">ANSWER:  May Day celebration and the political struggles for power. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">I now also knew that most of the communist leaders who came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">Rocco Shagerra(ph), Farkosh(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">And most of the Jews were not unsympathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">Some of them were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">Obviously the — the ones who were rich before, saw that the communists are not going to retain them as — as capitalists again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">But my family was never really rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">My father was a — an engineer, he figured he would be able to do business, he would be able to find a job, and we were not very worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">In fact, in 1945, Dudek(ph) — my father was able to reward Dudek(ph) and Dudek(ph) not November 13, 1997 only saved some of our food, but he also saved some of my father’s material, you know, ma — business, and so my father gave him half of it, and they started out a business, a little business right in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">Dudek(ph) was not a good businessman, so he — he didn’t do very well, but my father was, and — and he started to deal with the same people he dealt with du — before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">And it was a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">I mean, inflation was there for sure, but there were possibilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">And these possibilities ended in 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">What were the possibilities? </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">Well, one was, you know, we were Jewish and the Joint from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> had sent food and things, clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">I remember in 19 — I believe it was the summer of ’46, and I went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was run by the Joint and Zionists. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">And I was not a Zionist myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">We had a lot of Zionists in our — in our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and many of the teachers were Zionists, and they had socialist Zionists, such as the Hashomer Hatzair, and then they had Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">And one of the things which bothered me is that there was some animosity and definite animosity between both the teachers and the students who were of various persuasions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">I remember a particular teacher who didn’t like Orthodox Jews and who hit them, hit their heads, to hit their hats off and — and things like that, and I could never understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">After °44, how could a Jew hit another Jew because the Jew wears a hat? </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">And there were some very passionate discussions about, you know, Hashomer Hatzair and Irgun and all these others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">November 13, 1997 And Betar and — and whoever else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And some people who were orphans — many of my students — fellow students were orphans, moved into these Zionist camps, these little — they had <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zionist camps</span> , these little — they had houses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">And they lived like — like — they were told that they were like adults, I mean, 13 - 14 year old kids, they were adults, they could do anything they wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">And I was fortunate enough to have my parents, and in a sense I was a little bit jealous that they could do anything and I wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">I was still a son, and I was still a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">And despite ’44, you know, I — in a sense I reverted back to childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">I couldn’t accompli — completely in a hundred percent, but — but largely, and I was expected to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">And I was expected to forget about all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">And it been — and it had been bothering me for a long time, you know, what do you remember, how could you remember, you were too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">And the authenticity of these remembrances were always questioned, not by me, but by others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">But life went on and we were told, you know, that we shouldn’t dwell on the Holocaust, we shouldn’t dwell on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">We shouldn’t —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  When you say we were told, you mean your parents told you that, or other people told you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1322">ANSWER:  My parents told me, but mostly other people, and the — and th — and the newspapers, and the — an-and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you know, now you have to learn, now you are back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">Now you worry about your homework, now you worry November 13, 1997 about your exams. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">Now you do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">You know, we joined first the Boy Scouts, and then when the Boy Scouts were disbanded, the Young Pioneers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">And there was always something to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">There was some excitement too, I mean, how did we — how did we build — rebuild our lives? </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">What do we — what did we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">How did we do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">And as I mentioned, I was taken to one of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zionist camps</span> , I was — we had four languages in the same time, and I was never a good linguistic expert. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">We had Hebrew, Latin, English, and for a while German, but then that was dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">But three languages were more than enough for me, and I was not very good in either of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">And the only way I could not flunk Hebrew is that the — I promised my Hebrew teacher that I was going to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zionist camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">And they took me and I was unhappy and I s — I escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">I escaped after about a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">Went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my father was very upset with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">He felt that I was just a coward, that I just couldn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">I disagreed with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">But these things were not for me, I was — I was too much of a mother’s boy still, and I was still with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">I was only 12 years old, I mean, it’s not that I was — and this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was not exactly what you would call a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> here, it was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">And we didn’t get that much food, and the food was mostly split pea soup, which reminded me of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , which was the only food there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">But I had friends, and I started to — to form relationships. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">But I didn’t have too many friends of my own age. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> we le — lived in had a — a number of November 13, 1997 young girls who were older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">I was always attracted to young girls, and I was — these young girls were 16 - 17 - 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">And I was more mature than my age and I started to have — sort of strike up conversations with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">And I thought that I was enough of an intellectual challenge to — to talk to, to be talked to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">And our next door neighbor was a — her name was Miriam. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">She was not Jewish, she was 16 and she was telling me about the facts of life, and there was another girl downstairs who was — she was — her — her name was Maurika(ph) and she was 18 and she was a very studious girl and we had nice, interesting conversation about — conversations about literature and art and music and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">Of course, they all had their boyfriends, but I sort of fancied myself as being somehow a sutroga — surrogate boyfriend and — and was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">And so my — my — my life, my social life sort of started to evolve among these people, my neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">And many of my friends, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">And then I got involved in the Young Pioneers, and some other various organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">There was one organization, Young Workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">They were usually three, four years older than I was, and they were not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">And once I got into a — a real fight with them, and they told me that I was just a dirty little Jew, and they chased me out and chased me to — through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">And I — sort of 1t occurred to me that, my God, you know, these people are the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">They are not — they are not different any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">They are just the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">They are still calling me dirty Jew two November 13, 1997 years after the war, and they are still chasing me down the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">And then I had some doubts whether it was a good idea to stay in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">But these doubts were not, at this point were not very bad and very pronounced. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">This was 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">We had a— an election and the communists came in distant fourth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">We still had a democratic government.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1366">QUESTION:  Did you have a Bar Mitzvah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1367">ANSWER:  [had a Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">My Bar Mitzvah was an interesting one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">It — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> there were two <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">girl orphanage</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">boy orphanage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">The girl or- orphanage was very close to where we lived, so — and they had, of course, a <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">And Rabbi Schwartz was the rabbi there, and he instructed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">In 1947, I had the Bar Mitzvah there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">And my mother decided that I would have a Bar Mitzvah lunch, and well, what can you do with a lu — for a lunch, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">I invited the following people; there were a couple of communist kids in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they were about three years older than I was, but they were friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">And there was a fellow who was a friend of mine who was sort of a literary guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">And then a few friends, contemporaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">And I borrowed two girls from the <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , they came also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">And we had a very nice lunch, and the adults were in the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">That was my Bar Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">And I remember, I got a book, which I still have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">It’s in Hungarian, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">It’s about Jewish Middle Ages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">It’s about <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , the Spanish Jewish Middle November 13, 1997 Ages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">And it was by Roth, Sir ce — Sir Cecile Roth, famous historian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">I didn’t read the book, 1t was way above my head at that time, but for some reason or another, I — I got it— my mother got it out of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and I found it many years later and I read it with much interest, and I still have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">My Bar Mitzvah present. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">And then a stupid thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">A friend of mine was tackling me in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , right after my Bar Mitzvah and pushing me back and my shin broke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">And so, I missed about two weeks or three weeks of class. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">I was in a cast for six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">And after the cast my father and mother decided that I should go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a real camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">And they send me to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which was run by Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">Was run by a Olympic — Jewish Olympic wrestling champion by the name of Karpathi(ph), and it was called a Karpathi(ph) camp, it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">sports camp</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Karpathi(ph) camp</span> , it was a sports camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">And most of the kids were Jewish and I had a great time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">And it was three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">I didn’t escape there — from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">I learned how to bike again, because for some reason I forgot, and how to swim and how to do all those things; how to dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">There was a girl there who was 18 years old and who was really the owner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">Karpathi(ph) was sort of the manager. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">Kerienyi(ph), who was another wrestler, was the owner. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">And Judith was her — his daughter, and she was up there, sort of helping out with the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">And I got very, very friendly with her, and we talked, and she was engaged to another wrestler, to be married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">And she figures in my later life, that’s why I’m telling you this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">Anyway, Judith and I November 13, 1997 became friends and even after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I saw her many times and then we lost in touch maybe a half a year or so later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">Five years passed by, and I met her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">And I’m going to cut this story, because there will be some significance at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">But now we are still in 1947 — 1947 and 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">I had a happy education, particularly in one particular subject, which was history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">My homeroom teacher and my history teacher was one and the same, he was a young ma-man named Paul Poch(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">He turned out to be one of the great historians of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and he was very young man and he — one of his claim to fame was that he was also the director of the statistical survey run by the Joint, of the [indecipherable] remnants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">And you find a copy of the book in our <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">What they did is 400 people, in 1945, in August of ’45, went through every <span class="BUILDING">building</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and found the [indecipherable] remnants of — of Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">Found 68,000 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">There were — there were probably more, but many of them did not want to be registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">My family and I were — my family’s name and my name were — are in the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">Poch(ph) was the one who did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">Besides that, he was a brilliant teacher and he was my homeroom teacher for four years, and I wanted to be a historian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">Poch(ph) left the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because he became a professor, a full professor at age 28 in the <span class="BUILDING">University of Budapest</span> in the — the economic university of Budapest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">A few years later he became the — the dean, and a few years after that he became director. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">Then November 13, 1997 he became a absolute world class historian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">The one thing which he did however, is that he completely changed his point of view, he became a Marxist economic historian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">And he wa — he became one of their authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">And — but he was a humane person, and one of the interesting part was that one of the classes he taught in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> , who graduated in 1948 - ’49, of that class, three men went to his — his faculty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">They became very famous historians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">One of them became the president of the <span class="BUILDING">Academy of Sciences</span> , his name is Ivan Berendt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">He came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , he’s now a professor of history in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">UCLA</span> , and Poch(ph) helped him and helped others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">Helped one man by the name of Rankey(ph), who became a — a — an authority on Hungarian Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with George Pick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">This is tape number three, side B.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I was saying that Rankey(ph) was not a communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">He was — he became a Holocaust expert, historian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">And because of that his — his career during the communist ye-years was really jeopardized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">Poch(ph) helped him a great deal, and he helped others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">So although Poch became a communist, he was still a — a great human being and helped a great deal of — great many men and people in their — in November 13, 1997 their career. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">So I must say that I am personally very thankful to him and grateful, because for one, he taught me the love of history, which 1s — which I wanted to become my — my profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">Thankfully which did not become my profession, but a lifetime hobby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">1948, Poch(ph) leaves and a number of other teachers leave the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">Passover, Pesach, nine four — 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">We say goodbye to many of our friends who went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zionist camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">After Pesach, our s — our class of 38 became class of 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">The rest of the people left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">We found that they went through the Bricha lea(ph) to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">Many of them are still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">And we stayed — I wasn’t a Zionist — with this small, shrinking class. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">They combined the other class with us, which also shrunk, and of the 72 people, we had now a class of roughly 30, a combined class of 30. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">We had other teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">Some teachers left with the Bricha, some teachers stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">I became very interested in acting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">We had a little acting group in our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">I became interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">We had put on full three act plays. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">My father became interested in this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">He wanted to help the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">He found out that the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , of course, lost most of its <span class="INT_SPACE">labs</span> , and he wanted to raise money, so he figured a —a way to ask famous performers to come to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for nothing, and have fundraisings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">And he became involved in many of these kinds of fundraisings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">And you would not believe the most famous singers came to sing; Jews and non-Jews alike, and they are always sold out performances, and my father was really a great November 13, 1997 enterprise [indecipherable] and — and got enough money to rebuild the physics and biological libr — labs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">And in 1950 or ’51, they dedicated a <span class="BUILDING">greenhouse</span> on the top of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which my father raised money for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">And so my father became the president, or the P.T. and then my mother was very involved and I became involved with the — on a student level. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">And it was from °48 to ’50 - °52. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">They were — despite of the fact that — that there were — th-there were terrors, and — and — and worsening political situation and crisis, there was an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> became a —a separate <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> , where we had a dicono — dichotomy where we shared both what we needed to share, such as you know, what you needed to talk about, you know, the great <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communist camp</span> , and the [indecipherable] the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">imperialist camp</span> and all this phraseology, which we had to also say, but then we talked about what was the Voice of America saying, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">So it was a really funny, ironic situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">The same people who were parroting the phraseology were talking about the Voice of America. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">And the teachers who had to parrot the phraseology also, Marxist phraseology, which they didn’t believe in, who were Hebrew teachers before he beca — they became Marxist, quote unquote, teachers, who were teaching Yiddish instead of Russian, which they ended up teaching for a while, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">These teachers knew that this is a big joke, that nobody believes in this, but we pretended that something had to be done, and — and we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">Except for — November 13, 1997</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Di-Did the tightening of the government, or what you had to do, did that bring back any memories of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1466">ANSWER:  Well, it certainly did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">Of course, the — the tightening of the government, and the — the loss of rights brought back a lot of memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">And people who were deported during the Holocaust, were deported again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">This time not because they were Jewish, but because they were capitalists, and capitalists couldn’t live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , so they took the — took away their — their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and they deported them to the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1470">QUESTION:  Did that make you more nervous?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1471">ANSWER:  It absolutely did, but there was no choice in the matter now, of course, that the Iron Curtain was shut. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">In 1948, after the Bricha, and very shortly thereafter when the communists took power, things were over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">And by then, of course, those of us who recognized too late, and too belatedly that we were pretty stupid again, we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">So what could you do, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">Well, what you could do was what we did, which is to go along outwardly, and go to the May celebrations and the November celebrations, and at the same time talk about BBC and Radio Free Europe and trying to keep each other in — in a Jewish era. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">We were — we were still studying — not legally at this point — Jewish things, Jewish history.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1477">QUESTION:  Did you feel more Jewish now than you had many years ago? </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">November 13, 1997</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">In the next — in the first two years after the war, Jewish gymnasium meant that we were not studying, we were — we do not have Saturday classes, but instead we had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> meant that we were not studying, we were — we do not have Saturday classes, but instead we had to go to the synagogue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">So we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">That wasn’t a pleasant thing for me, I was never a synagogue goer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">But it made me want to know more Jewish history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">It made me much more of a conscious Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">And after the communist takeover, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was closed, we couldn’t — the — the — the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> of the — the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> was closed, it was no longer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">So — but — but we still had some spark, and — and many times the spark was nothing more than, I know you are Jewish and you know that I am Jewish, and you can trust me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">And that was not always the case, unfortunately, although I think we always knew whom we could trust, within the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">We knew that there were a few people who — who we could not, including teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">And this came to a head in 1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">In 1950, there was a letter, which was drafted by a teacher and a student, which was circulated in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , demanding of the government of nationalizing our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">And they tried to intimidate the students and the teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">And it came to a head because there was a conference, a te — a teacher-student-parent conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">And it was supposed to be a secret letter, but somebody told that — the principal of what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">And this —all hell broke loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">And I was there and I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">There was a parent of a classmate of mine whose — who told the students and the teacher, who did not want November 13, 1997 to identify himself, that they are cowards, they are damn cowards, and they are traitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">And it was really embarrassing because this was a communist inspired thing, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">And this was toward the end of the school year, and in the next <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year, we had from 200 students, to 45, including the teacher who was — who — whom we found out was a— was a defector. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">And he left, he became a principal somewhere else, and all these students. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">But I stayed, and 45 of us stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">Our class of 30 became a class of 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">This was our sixth grade, 1t was <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">And we stayed, and we became more Jewish, although outwardly we could do less. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">We couldn’t talk about Jewish history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">We couldn’t talk about Jewish things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">But we could talk about books written by Stefan Zweig and Berfer(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">And we could sabotage learning Russian, for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">An ex-rabbi was teaching us Russian, who did not know from Russian from a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">I mean, he was always a —a lesson ahead of us, but that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">And — and we took this as a joke, <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">But we realized more and more, and more and more keenly that this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> for us, is going to come to an end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">And then what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">And that end came in 1952, when I graduated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">Now one of the motivations of the — all of my classmates who left, was that nobody’s going to be accepted in a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> from a <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> such as the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">That was the motivation why they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">It turned out very ironically, that out of the two — four — 13 of us who graduated, 11 of us were 100November 13, 1997 accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">Because the regime in 1952 wanted to show the world that there was such a thing as religious freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">Much less of the people who left were accepted, percentage-wise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">The only two who were not, were bad students, period, who didn’t even want to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">I was accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">And here came the big shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">The big culture shock, because I was trusting to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , the technical university, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> <span class="BUILDING">technical university</span> , Budapest, where we had a class of 1200 people, from 13 to 1200. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">And we had this huge <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and we were sitting there, you know, men and women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">And I found myself in — very much in a minority. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">This was the year where it made a difference who’s — who your parents were; if your parents were peasants or workers, you got accepted regardless of your qualifications. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">If your parents were businessmen, you wat — you were rejected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">My father was in-between, and I sort of, because he was a — what they call an intellectual, or a professional, that was not well thought of, but it was better than a businessman for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">My father wasn’t a businessman by then, he worked for another company. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">And so in — I was able to slip in on this, but I found my colleagues to be very different from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">The chemistry worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">Very quickly we found from each other — 0-of each other, who were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">Of the f— of the 1200, roughly about 150 of us were Jewish, which was a large percentage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">And as I says, the magic of chemistry, I mean, we didn’t know from Adam. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">We found us, each other and we drifted toward each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">The way the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> were — was 101November 13, 1997 divided up, we had subspecialties within mechanical engineering — this was only mechanical engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">We had specialties on textile engineering, shipbuilding, whatever else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">And in my subspecialty, which was naval archy — naval architecture, we had 30 people, I was the only Jew, and the rest of them were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">And we were sort of drifting in and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">I was — I was never really very friendly with these people because their culture, their — their interests were very different from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">I felt sorry for them because they were not really qualified and they were really struggling with the material. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">They didn’t know elementary algebra when they had to learn calculus, and they really had a heck of a hard time, although the regime gave them all sorts of scholarships and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">I have to step back now because there is a — an important thing which happened in my life, right before graduation, personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">And that — what happened was that I fell in love, 18 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">This was right before graduation in February of 1952. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">Fell in love with a young girl who didn’t understand my — my feelings, and I was very brokenhearted when my feelings were not reciprocated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">And I was so brokenhearted that I fell sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">They thought I had mononucleosis and other diseases and I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">And this was in February - March of *52, just before graduation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">And my wa — mother and father were worried that I was going to se — lose that year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">But my colleagues were very nice and they brought me up to date very f— very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">Then April roll — rolled along, and walking 102November 13, 1997 on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , in a nice, bright, April afternoon, I met this girl who was very familiar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">Made a long story short, it was the girl, Judith Kerienyi(ph), whom I met five years earlier in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">Then we started to talk, she was, at this point, just graduating from <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">She became a singer, she never married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">Didn’t marry the — broke off with the fiancé, and she was single. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">I was 18, she was 22 - 23. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">And it was a romance, and it was maybe an antidote to the love, the unrequited love I had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">It became a very hot romance, not to my mother’s liking and my father’s liking, who felt that I should really learn and study. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">The way it went in our school system is that we finished the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> early, in May, and then we had six weeks of real study, after which we had a five hour oral exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">And it was almost like a PhD thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">And the six weeks we supposed to cram in everything we need to know about the oral. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">And we had these little [indecipherable] things, they had hundreds of questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">We knew the questions, we just needed to learn the answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">Of course, that was the trick, you know, you can’t learn eight years of answers in two months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">You really had to learn some other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">But at that point, you know, the — the summer was full blown and — and I was too interested in — in — in everything, mostly Judith, and less interested in the study. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">But I studied a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">And — and it was just the hottest romance we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">It was sort of crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">The — her parents worked, my parents worked, so both of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> were vacant during the day and we 103November 13, 1997 took advantage of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">And it was my real — first real romance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">I mean, I had some sex before, but they were occasional type things, mostly prostitutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">This was really a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">I didn’t know what — and she didn’t know how to handle it either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">Which was too bad because she was 22, I was 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">If I didn’t know how to handle it, well, that was something, but she — she should have known better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">Made a longer story short, she became pregnant, and of course, my father and I didn’t see eye to eye through this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">I wanted to marry her, of course, it was moral obligation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">My fa — my mother told me the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">My father said absolutely not, I am — you are a minor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">In —in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> you were a minor until 21, and I’m not giving your permission and that’s that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">Make the long story short, we didn’t marry and she had an abortion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">And there is a letter which I still possess, which my mother wrote to Judith, where it was a woman to woman letter; a very sad one, in fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">And saying that, you know, she understands the — the pain and the sorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">But she has to understand that I am too young and I am just starting my — my schooling, and she should have known better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">And that romance stayed with me for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">That was really a very potent one in many different respects, and I never forgot it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">It was a happy ending, if you want, because she had an abortion, and then she got married and she has children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">Nothing bad happened to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">But perhaps I am kidding myself, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">And I went on to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I had this — and I had another girlfriend about a 104November 13, 1997 year later, who was more to my level of interest maybe, and same age as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">And the shock went on for four years, from 1952 to ’56. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">I had the same girlfriend this time, Erica was her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">And we had a tempestuous relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">But there was a — there was something important which happened, not just with her but with my circle of — small circle of friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">We still kept going to — to — to operas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">We went to <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">We kept a cultural core, which the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in itself did not, you know, they — they sort of sank into this Bolshevik slide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">But we kept a western level of culture, and I think that kept our humanity, too, in a — 1n a great degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">Between 1952 and ’56, times were hard, and I was working very hard in — in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , trying to earn my college tuition, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">We were not rich, and I really needed to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">In the summertime, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">I went to — this was not my choice, I had to do work once — one month every summer, work — we got paid — in industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">And one month every summer, we had to go to the — to the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">And I had a hard time in the army, I must tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">Both — I had three summers which I had to go to the army, and all those three summers were very, very hard for me, I was not cut out to be a soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">And that in is — in itself a story of itself, but I’m not going to go in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">Fifty-six came around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">The winds of change started to be felt, and then tragedy struck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">My father all of a sudden got sick and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">He got celebra — cerebral hemorrhage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">He was a chain smoker, and finally got to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">This was at the end of March, right 105November 13, 1997 during my period of exams, final exams. </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">And I was very scared, and I didn’t know how to handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">I was 22. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">I had a ver — a very good friend, his name was Dionege(ph) Brock(ph), he was stud — he was studying to be a rabbi; in fact, he was already a — an ordained rabbi and I asked him what he thinks, what he thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">He knew Erica very well, he knew me very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">He was a very, very close friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">He sort of said look, I think you should pull together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">You should have a better — a bigger family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">You should really be not one — I mean you — my family, my real family was not very close knit, particularly after my father died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">In fact, even in the last few years before my father died, my mother and father sort of drifted apart, and I drifted apart from my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">And I drifted — the only person I had close was my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">I had a couple of cousins I wasn’t that friendly with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">My maternal grandmother died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">My paternal grandparents still had this family gathering every Sunday, but after 18 I didn’t want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">I found them strange, I had nothing to say to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">So here, after my father died, I had literally very few people to go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">And I was scared, so Erica’s family, she had a sister and mother, father; they were very nice people, I liked them, and I liked Erica. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">And — and essentially I felt that maybe this 1s the time when — when I should have my own, and then I engaged — I became engaged to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">And we had an engagement in August. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">And we were planning to get married after I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , which was at the fall of 1956. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">It was going to 106November 13, 1997 be in October of ’56. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">And in fact, in October of ’56 — I just completed my last exam on the 22™ of October. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">The 23" of October became a notable day, but for me the 224 was the — the real clincher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">There was a meeting late in the afternoon, right after my exam, where I went to, student meeting, which lasted until three o’clock in the morning, and which, at the end, we declared that <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> must be an independent state and should declare neutrally — neutrality and the Russians, we demanded the Russians get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">And we agreed that on the 23" in the morning, we would all come back to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and we would have a — a demonstration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">Came October 23", I went to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , we waited until late afternoon, we finally got permission for the demonstration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">I was there in Parliament Square, and then I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> <span class="DLF">Parliament Square</span> , and then I went home and then the shooting war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> about a week later, and I participated in some of the — the skirmishes which had happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">November second, the Russian tanks rumbled through our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tanks</span> rumbled through our neighborhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1641">QUESTION:  Wh-When you say you participated, what did that mean, in the skirmishes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1642">ANSWER:  Meaning I was shooting guns at whoever was shooting guns at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">This was a shoot —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And you — you — you — you were shooting guns after seeing — being much younger in a war where you saw other people being shot? </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">107November 13, 1997</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Remember, this is a revolution against the Russians now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">I am now with the good guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">I am — I am fighting for Hungarian independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">I am just a graduate of a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">I feel that maybe we have a chance, although some people think it’s ridiculous, and I find out a few days later that it 1s ridiculous, the world 1s not going to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">Second of November came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">The Russians came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">I felt that 1t was futile, and at that point I wanted to stay alive, I d—I didn’t go out to shoot any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1652">QUESTION:  Ho — and seeing the Russians coming in 1n their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , did that trigger any memories for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1653">ANSWER:  It did, it certainly did, th-the memory of that March Sunday, when the Germans — German tanks came in the very same route, toward the — the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> came in the very same route, toward the — the center of the city, and that — that memory also triggered that, you know, what is happening here is — 1s history repeating itself, or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">But there was not very much time for thinking here, because there was a war going on and for two weeks there was a — a real fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">I mean, at that point we went — everybody from the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we lived when down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , just like we had in 1944, and °45. </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">It was artillery duels. </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">And by November, by the 20" of November, the inside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> was completely demolished again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">I mean, 10 years after the war, the downtown area looked just like it did in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">Twenty-second of November — oh, during this period of time, we 108November 13, 1997 are listening to radio free Europe and a voice of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">And I was particularly appalled by the fact that I was sitting in Elizabeth Street, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , while a bunch of people are already sending messages from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> to their relatives, saying that they are already in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and they don’t know whether they are going to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> <span class="DLF">Elizabeth Street</span> , in a basement, while a bunch of people are already sending messages from Austria to their relatives, saying that they are already in Austria and they don’t know whether they are going to Australia or Canada yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">And I’m sitting as — like a rat in a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">And I, just to mys — I am saying to myself, I mean, how many mistakes can I make? </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">I mean, my mother and father made enough mistakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">I’m not going to make the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">So, on the spur of the moment, I called my fiancée and a friend, that in the next morning we are going to meet in [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and then we’ll see what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">And I bicycled there, because there was nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">Said goodbye to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">The decision took all of a half an hour, and in the next morning we met at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">We had a vague plan, which 1s to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> and then feel our way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">We never got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">After the — the — this is chaos now, there is no central government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">The Russians are occupying part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , not all of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">There 1s still fighting going on in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1674"><span class="DLF">Railroads</span> have no schedule, government is nonexistent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">People are doing their thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">Obviously a lot of them are already outside of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was completely packed, maybe a thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">And shortly after we started, we found out that most of the thousand people had the same idea, to go to the western 109November 13, 1997 border and get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">We were told that it’s dangerous to keep maps, so we throwed the maps away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">I had a couple of things in my pocket, two overcoats and a few other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">Couple of pieces of jewelry sewn into my pocket and who knows who to bribe, how to do whatever is going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">We had no idea.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1683">QUESTION:  What’s it like to make decisions yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">Previously, in the war, it was your parents who made the decisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1685">ANSWER:  Well, it — I was 22 years old and I felt that in the war I made a few decisions which saved my life, and I am not going to stay around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">I knew that some people knew that I was participating 1n the fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">I knew that the Russians are not going to be very merciful for those who were participating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">I could end up in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , or worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1689">So I didn’t have much of a choice and I really wanted to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">I — I thought this was the most psychologically opportune moment in the world for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1691">I had completed my undergraduate education, and here is an opportunity I would — would pay, you know, I would take whatever chances there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1692">To make the long story short, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> never reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">It stopped in a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , some 20 — 25 miles from the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">We slept there, and the very next morning went to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , we got into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1695">The cattle train stopped in the middle of the day, in the middle of nowhere, and then we walked for two days, and ended up at the <span class="DLF">border</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> stopped in the middle of the day, in the middle of nowhere, and then we walked for two days, and ended up at the border. </span><span class="sentence" id="1696">And I didn’t like the situation very much, because in the 110November 13, 1997 <span class="DLF">border</span> there was some fighting at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">So I told my fiancée and our — our friend to — we are moving back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">We moved back to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">I met a— we met a fellow who told us that he would help us the very next morning, because he knew a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1700">And we also told him to go back to our parents and see if they would be able to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1701">The next morning we went out bright, early morning, and he told us that between those two haystacks, if we stay between them it’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1702">That haystack — beyond that haystack are the Russian, beyond that haystack are the Hungarian communists, but in-between is okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1703">And that’s what we did, we went in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">The only problem was that right before no man’s land, there was a quarter of a mile of completely cleared land, and behind that there were <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> , <span class="BUILDING">watch towers</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1705">QUESTION:  Do you think your experience during the war helped you get through this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1706">ANSWER:  Probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">At that point I was only thinking about the now and the then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1709">Th-The moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">We knew that we had to go — go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">We knew that we also had an excellent chance of being shot in the back from the <span class="DLF">watchtowers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">We also knew that in front of us, which used to be a <span class="DLF">minefield</span> , the <span class="DLF">mines</span> were removed a few months before, and we have no other <span class="DLF">barrier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">And this was the chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1714">And I think there are some points in life when one does not think too much, and hesitate too much, because if one does, one gets paralyzed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">So what I just did, I started to curse in Hungarian, started to yank my fiancée as fast as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1716">We ran though this 111November 13, 1997 part, and it took us probably all of two minutes, but it 11 — seemed like an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">And then we were there, we were — we were in no-man’s land, we saw the Austrian flags, and we were on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and then in about five minutes later, the Austrian border patrol intercepted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">We didn’t speak the language, but they didn’t want. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">Turned out, when we ww-went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lutzmannsdorf</span> , which was the first little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , is that the night before, the border police all defected, and so nobody was up there, but I didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">So my — my luck was still — still with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1721">And then the very next day, the Joint came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eisenstaedt</span> , which was the next largest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">They took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1723">It was already organized, all the <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , which was Hitler’s hometown, were reserved for the Jews, and that was an ironic twist of fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">It was Wiesenthal — I don’t know if you know the name Wiesenthal, Simon Wiesenthal, who was in charge of that operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">We had hundreds of Hungarian Jews there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">The non-Hungarian — Hungarian non-Jews were thrown into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and we were there for three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">Meanwhile, the Joint fed us and paid our <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">There came recruiters from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">When they found out that I was an engineer, young engineer, they said absolutely, you should come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">When they found out that I had an uncle here, they said no problem at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">And three weeks later, on the 19" of December of 1956, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> touched down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newark</span> , and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Kilmer</span> , and a day later I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">November 13, 1997</p>
<p>QUESTION:  How did you feel putting your foot down on <span class="REGION">American soil</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1733">ANSWER:  Well, it was unreal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">We had a 30 hour flight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">We stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reykjavik</span> — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reykjavik</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Iceland</span> , we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> , we were in <span class="REGION">Labrador</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">Not the jet planes, th-they — they had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jet</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jet planes</span> , th-they — they had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jet planes</span> in ’56. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">It was a — it was an exhaustive — exhausting trip because the night before we started, we already were going — we originally were going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> we didn’t have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so they sent us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muenchen(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">And so we were on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> for 14 or 15 hours before we had the 30 hour flight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">So I was sort of in no-man’s land. </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">There was one thing which happened a day before we left, which was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">We visited <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">This was an inoculation against Europe and against any kind of — of — of wanting to go back to the old — to the old — to the old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">End of Tape Three, Side B 113 November 13, 1997 Beginning Tape Four, Side A</p>

fiancée and my friend and I decided to inoculate ourselves against any kind of homesickness, so visited mau — we visited Mauthausen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> is ina fantastic <span class="NPIP">place</span> , it’s on the top of a <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">Beautiful view, and unspeakable horrors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">In °56, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> was very different, I am sure, than what it is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">It was much closer to what it was in 1944, and we had a vivid sense of what had — what must have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">And — and it certainly recalled all the horrors which we read about and which we heard about from the surviving friends and relatives who came back and who — some of whom came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">I have a number of uncles who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> and who came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">And so I could now put together the — the name and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and it certainly cured me for — for many, many years, for 38 years from — from any kind of homesickness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">And then the next morning, as I mentioned, we were bound to go to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> and then back and forth until we 114 November 13, 1997 got to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1756">Prior to leaving, finding ou — we only found out that we were coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> about a week before we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1757">We did not know precisely what was going to happen, how long things would take. </span><span class="sentence" id="1758">And shortly after we left <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , my mother and I, and my fiancée’s parents were in daily telephone contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1759">The original plan was that her — her parents and my mother would essentially come to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and then we would meet there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">The peasant who helped us over, indeed went to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and he on — he also told them that they could come with him and he would help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">But they didn’t want to take the chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">It started to be fairly late in December. </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">My mother and a cousin of mine went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Szeged</span> , which is close to the <span class="DLF">Yugoslavian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">They tried it there, they couldn’t do it, they were turned back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1765">And I told my mother not to go anywhere, just stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and see what happens and leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> legally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1766">I didn’t want to wait for her because by then we had the papers and I didn’t want to miss the opportunity to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1767">So, late at night on the 19" of December we touched down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">On the 20", I met my uncle, who was very strange, or somewhat strange, told me that you don’t need those Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">You come with me, I live in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , and Ill take care of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">I told him that, that’s nice, but I came with my fiancée and I’m not going to let her just drift away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">He reluctantly took her also with him, and us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1772">We went to this New Jersey place, it’s 115November 13, 1997 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wharton</span> , New Jersey, it’s a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , it’s a small town, small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hungarian town</span> , sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1773">Most of the Hungarians who live there, lived there since either the 20s or 30s, or after the war, which meant that most of them were Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1774">Now my uncle 1s a fisi— was a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="1775">I didn’t know it then, but I found out very soon that he converted, and he wanted to keep his Jewish origins a deep, dark secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">This led to a fallout, and a very irreconcilable difference between him and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">Until I left <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , I went to say Kaddish for my father every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1778">When I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1779">There was no Jewish synagogue in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wharton</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish synagogue</span> in Wharton. </span><span class="sentence" id="1780">My uncle arranged for me to have a job, mean — two — two weeks after I came, as well as my fiancée. </span><span class="sentence" id="1781">She was a chemist, she spoke English, she got a fairly good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1782">I got a general helper’s job in a small <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , not a very satisfactory job for an engineer, but that was what I cou-could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1783">What — and it went on for a couple of months, but what really broke things 1s that in March was my Yahrzeit, and my fiancée and I had decided to go to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which had a little, small <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1784">And we — to say Kaddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">So I went to say Kaddish, and there we met a friend of my uncle’s whom we — knew we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">And that friend told my uncle a couple days later that we saw George and his fiancée in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1787">You know, ho — what — what’s going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="1788">Well, my uncle was quite furious about this and told me that — why didn’t I tell him this, he would have taken me a hundred miles somewhere, where nobody knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1789">So it 116November 13, 1997 was a big fallout. </span><span class="sentence" id="1790">I wrote to my mother very angrily, and so angry that I forgot to put the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="1791">And it — the letter was intercepted by the mailman, who was a Hungarian, who gave it to the Hungarian priest of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , who opened the letter and in short order found out who the letter came from, and with e — much glee I am sure, gave it to my uncle, who almost killed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1792">And wrote a letter to my mother that I will end up in a gallows in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I will — and I am just a terrible person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1793">My mother, who was absolutely petrified as to what will happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1794">Anyway, make the long story short on that, I was able to get a scholarship at <span class="BUILDING">Temple University</span> to learn English, and in March of 1958, which was — °57 rather, sorry, three and a half months after I went to live with my uncle, I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1795">My fiancée stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1796">I went to vi — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , I stayed there for over a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1797">My fiancée and I sort of broke up at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1798">She moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and later on she got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1799">My uncle and I broke up quite a bit, quite severely, and my mother left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> in August of 1957, with a visa to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1800">She never went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , she stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1801">My uncle, who was her brother, helped him — her a bit, however, in reality what he did 1s he told me that I have to help my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1802">And I sent my uncle a certain amount of money every month so that he would send it to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1803">After <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> , I got a job as an engi — junior engineer at <span class="BUILDING">Westinghouse</span> , and I was there for about four months, after which I got a scholarship at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drexel</span> and November 13, 1997 I started to study engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1804">And I did that until March of ’58, at which time I found out that my mother was going to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and she will be coming in the next six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1805">And my uncle very specifically told me that he was not going to help my mother come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , or help her when she’s here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1806">So I had no choice in the matter, I quit <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1808">I was unemployed there for a little while, and then my friends have it — my friend’s help, I got a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1809">And with another interesting story, I met a Russian princess who helped me to get the job here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1810">This Russian princess happened to be the cousin of the Lazar(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1811">Her name was Princess Trumbetskoy(ph), and for some reason and another, hil — she liked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1812">And she called Cardinal O’ Boyle, who was the chancellor of the Catholic University of America and told him that, here is this refugee boy, and that she would like to help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1813">And I got a interview, and I got a job as an instructor there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1814">I also enrolled in <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> there, I stayed there for seven years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1815">I taught there mechanical engineering, a-and endi — ending up as an as- assistant professor and receiving my Master’s degree in mechanical engineering in 1962. </span><span class="sentence" id="1816">In 1960, I met a young, Jewish girl, and we got married that summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1817">That marriage was a disaster and we divorced nine months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1818">Two months after I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> in ’58, my mother arrived here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1819">And I live with my mother from °58 until 64. </span><span class="sentence" id="1820">And I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and my mother — most of the 118November 13, 1997 time my mother didn’t work, essentially. </span><span class="sentence" id="1821">She found a little job to get a social security, finally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1822">And the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> was — the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> experience was — was not as rewarding as I was hoping for, it — it’s a small <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1823">At that time <span class="BUILDING">Catholic University</span> was a rather backwards school in terms of theology. </span><span class="sentence" id="1824">They still didn’t step out to the 15" century, and although they tolerated me as a Jew, they didn’t tolerate me as a divorced Jew, and I got some flack and by the time I realized that that’s not much of a future for me, I got another job, and I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">Well, actually, divorce wasn’t as bad as my remarriage in 1964. </span><span class="sentence" id="1826">I met another Jewish girl here, and we married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1827">And that — after that, things became very intolerable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1828">By then I only worked part-time at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">I got a job in a research inst — a research in — firm, a small firm, and it was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1830">One thing which happened after I got my citizenship in 1962, shortly after I got my degree, 1s I got my passport, and I took advantage of still working in a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and I went to Europe for two months, which was the first time since ’56, and the first time I really had a chance to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1831">And it was a fabulous two months of — of — of not just vacationing, but — but discovering <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1832">It was very interesting, because I sailed on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , which was called the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">USS France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1833">On the manifesto of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , there was a girl, her name was Toby Yaspar(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">She became my wife a year later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1835">We didn’t know that we were sailing on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , or if we were traveling together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1836">We met in a 119November 13, 1997 —in a Jewish get together, about a half a year later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1837">In 1966, I went to join the — work for the navy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1838">At that time I already finished all the courses which I needed for my PhD, and I needed a thesis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1839">And the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> had no laboratory which was really capable of doing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1840">So one of the lecturers there, who worked for the David Taylor Model Basin, told me to come to work for him, and then I can work on my thesis there, which is what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1841">I worked there 11 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1842">I worked there in high energy gas dynamics, and I wrote my thesis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1843">I never got my degree, because by the time I wrote my thesis, I lost my minors, which was nuclear engineering, and I just didn’t — I was in — 1n <span class="BUILDING">school</span> studying 12 years at that point, and I had enough of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1844">And I really didn’t think that I needed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1845">So I had all the PhD courses finished, and I — the thesis finished, the comprehensive was the only thing I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1846">It was 11 years of research; nice years, interesting research. </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">I wrote more than 50 papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">I was involved in the professional development there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1849">And then in 1977, I had an opportunity to get a promotion somewhere else, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1850">I moved from 19 — from <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> where | lived, to <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1851">Unfortunately, my family life did not turn out as well as my career. </span><span class="sentence" id="1852">After six years, my wife and I, with mutual consent got divorced. </span><span class="sentence" id="1853">Reason why we did — and this was a — again a fairly long story, is I had a problem having children, wanting children, and she wanted children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1854">We went through three years of therapy and the therapy resolved nothing except that her 120November 13, 1997 biological clock was running and that the only way that she could have a child is if she will marry somebody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1855">QUESTION:  Did you not want children because what of — you went through when you were a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1856">ANSWER:  Precisely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1857">I didn’t think that I would be a very competent father after which I went through, and the father which I — whom I had, whom I adored in one sense and in another sense I was very ambivalent about, and I was afraid that I would be just like him and I would be incompetent and I didn’t want anybody to have that kind of a life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1858">I went through three more years of therapy after this, because I wasn’t sure that — 1f it was the final decision, but it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1859">Then we divorced in ’73 - ’74. </span><span class="sentence" id="1860">And it was during our separation when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1861">It was a fantastic experience in 1970. </span><span class="sentence" id="1862">It was a real revelation, and the first time in my life, perhaps, I felt <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1863">And I didn’t feel <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in a sense that I wanted to live there, but I felt a real close kinship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1864">I had many friends there, and — and the <span class="REGION">land</span> was just indescribable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1865">I went back two more times in the next 15 years after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1866">I traveled a great deal, I was single for 20 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1867">I traveled every year abroad, from the <span class="REGION">Far East</span> to the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> to Europe many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1868">My career went fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1869">I worked for the navy two more jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1870">From 1977 to ’88, I worked for a high energy laser project, where I became a project manager, and it was a very exciting, new edge, high — 121 November 13, 1997 high tech e — envelope program, edge of the envelope program. </span><span class="sentence" id="1871">And the next one is —ha-happened from 1988 to 1994, where I worked for a multi-national project office, which was the NATO [indecipherable] office, where I very — where I jokingly said I wanted this job because I — al-always in my job I was the only one with an accent, and this — in this <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , I would be in the majority, having 13 different <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> , and people from 13 different <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> work there, although I was the only Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1872">And we had a lot of fun, it was a very interesting project, developing a — a vertical missile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1873">And I was very instrumental in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1874">After the project was over, which was in 1993, unfortunately things for the navy became a little bleak, and the technical challenges — whereas the money sort of went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1875">And at the end of 1994, I decided to — to retire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1876">There were two things which happened in the early 90s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1877">One is that my mother got sick at age 89. </span><span class="sentence" id="1878">We lived apart, but very close for 20 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1879">Now, we moved back together, she moved back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">She was an invalid and I took care of her for 18 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">And the last 18 months of her life perhaps was the happiest for many years for her, in spite of her sickness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1882">She felt that we were again together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1883">In her 90" birthday she beca — she got the heart failure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">They pulled her out for some reason, she lived six more weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1885">And then in May of 1991, she died of heart failure, her fourth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1886">In 1990, after some unsuccessful relationships, some long term, some short term, I met a woman who was as far 122November 13, 1997 away from my culture as anybody could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1887">She wa — she’s Mexican, her name is Letitia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1888">And what I found out, actually it was in 1991, and I found out that when my mother got sick, that my American girlfriend didn’t stick out with me, but this woman, whom I met only two or three weeks earlier, did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1889">And she stuck with me for a year and a half almost, with — under these conditions and — and I found not only a kinship, but also love. </span><span class="sentence" id="1890">We got married in 1992, and we are still married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1891">She works in the <span class="BUILDING">Mexican embassy</span> and we are pretty happy now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1892">So I think that’s the end of the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1893">QUESTION:  Well, there are just a few more things I want to ask you now about working at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> as a volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1894">What was your first encounter with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> before you went to work there? </span><span class="sentence" id="1895">How did you learn about the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1896">ANSWER:  I learned about the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> probably 10 years before it was built, through some solicitations and through friends whose — who provided some funds to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1897">I did not know very much about the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> until I saw an ad, I think in the “Washington Jewish Week,” where the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> advertised for volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1898">This was in 1992. </span><span class="sentence" id="1899">And I went to the L Street, where the museum headquarters were at the time, and I didn’t know what was going on, and I volunteered and I said I could help in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> <span class="DLF">L Street</span> , where the <span class="BUILDING">museum headquarters</span> were at the time, and I didn’t know what was going on, and I volunteered and I said I could help in the library, could do some translations from Hungarian to English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1900">And I got —I—I worked a little bit with — with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> — with Sheri(ph) Shebo(ph) — you know 123November 13, 1997 —I don’t know if you know Sheri(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1901">She — I think she still works up in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1902">And I worked there for a couple of months until the first course started for the volunteers for the visitors’ services. </span><span class="sentence" id="1903">And I was in — in that group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1904">QUESTION:  Why — why did you start working for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1905">ANSWER:  I felt that the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> fulfills a mission for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1906">I am a survivor and I had a responsibility and a mission until I can, and I’m capable of, to associate myself with projects which have something to do with the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1907">My awareness started before the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , in the mid — mid-80s, when Holocaust became a subject, which they spoke again about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1908">As you know, the Holocaust was a taboo subject, even in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1909">Although I read a n— a number of books, it’s astonishing how little came up between say 1956 and 1986. </span><span class="sentence" id="1910">There were a few books only, and not very much of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1911">I think where I became more aware is the gathering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1912">I was a volunteer there, because I felt that I was really not a survivor, that — that, you know, this was for the older survivors, and the concept of child survivor did not hit me at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1913">It hit me a couple of years later, when I started to read about child survivor groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1914">And in 1991 I got associated with a group here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , called the Washington-Baltimore area child survivors, and I became very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="1915">We had a conference in 1991, and at that time I knew about the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and I became very interested in that, as well as the child survivor group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1916">I 124 November 13, 1997 started to write, I started to read more, I started to speak to groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1917">And by 1992 - 1993, I was a —a full-fledged volunteer who is — was more than eager to do something, and I liked the idea of wanting to educate the public, as well as others, about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1918">I felt that the people, even the Jewish people, were ignorant and that they really need education, and I felt that the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> was a — was the vehicle for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1919">And so when we finished, I was more than eager to start working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1920">The first thing I did is I, when the opportunity arose, I — I completed the learning center specialist course, and I finished another cor — specialized course for — for student, and then for teacher guides in the permanent exhibition, which I still can do, and do occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1921">And then I got associated with the speakers’ bureau in 1980 — in 1995. </span><span class="sentence" id="1922">And in 795 - ’96, I— I spoke to a number of outside groups: among them <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> , a number of army establishments, <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1923">And I feel that — that that aspect of — of my work, in conjunction with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> is very appropriate for me as a — as a survivor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1924">QUESTION:  Are the talks that you give to these groups different?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1925">ANSWER:  Some of them are different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1926">Most of them center about my own story, you know, survi — as a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1927">But I have spoken to <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> , such as the Lee High School in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Silver Spring</span> <span class="BUILDING">Lee High School</span> in Silver Spring about other things, such as the relevance of — of the Holocaust in today’s world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1928">It’s a —1t’s amazing how many people think that the 125November 13, 1997 Holocaust is really not relevant, and how I feel that that’s wrong, and that there is tremendous relevance even today and will for the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="1929">In a sense, I am very desperate to — to — to preserve the memory, which whatever means that takes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1930">I wrote up my story, which was published, incidentally, in 1993 also, asa—asa collection of stories with 11 other Hungarians and — and it’s published in a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1931">And I — I am writing now a — a lo — long — longer autobiography which will be probably a full-length book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1932">Not just my Holocaust, but my post-Holocaust experience in life in general.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1933">QUESTION:  How has working at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> affected your life? </span><span class="sentence" id="1934">Has it affected your memories of the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1935">ANSWER:  It certainly has. </span><span class="sentence" id="1936">It induced me to — to learn a lot more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1937">I thought I knew the Holocaust fairly well, through roughly 10 - 15 years of reading, but I found out that I needed to learn a great deal too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1938">And in the last five years, oh, I read maybe a couple of hundred books on the Holocaust and I took a number of courses, mostly in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1939">There are tremendous courses in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , for learning center specialists and research department. </span><span class="sentence" id="1940">I try to go to every course and every lecture and every one or two day cour — one or two day —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Seminars, conference? </span><span class="sentence" id="1941">126November 13, 1997</p>
<p>ANSWER:  — sem-seminars, wherever it’s offered, then wherever I have time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1942">I — I went maybe 50 of them already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1943">So I am — I’m really immersed, and it made me very conscious about a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1944">A lot of things which a lot of people just sort of don’t care about or — or feel that it’s not — not relevant any more, and I think it 1s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1945">QUESTION:  Why do you think it’s relevant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1946">ANSWER:  Why 1s it relevant? </span><span class="sentence" id="1947">I think that it’s relevant because people are — most people in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and everywhere else in the world are still as disinterested in what happens to other groups who are discriminated against, or who are being killed, as they were 53 years ago when the Jews were killed, and I think the message 1s still fresh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1948">You cannot be disinterested, you must be involved, because involvement is the only insurance for the world to prevent mass genocides.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1949">QUESTION:  Do you think, as a staff member at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , you bring special insights because you are a survivor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1950">ANSWER:  I do believe that that’s the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1951">I believe that every time that I say to a group who comes, and whose — and I give group — little — little group orientations when I say that my name is George Pick and I am a survivor and all of a sudden everybody looks at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1952">And it — it — I think a survivor is a — 1s the only direct link people have to the Holocaust, and I believe that that is a unique thing I bring to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and 127November 13, 1997 all the survivors who are there, bring to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1953">And I think the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> should take maximum advantage of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1954">QUESTION:  With your survivor friends, have you ever tried to encourage them to volunteer at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and if so what — what did they respond to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1955">ANSWER:  Yes, I do, I— the — I have two sets of survivor friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1956">The — some of them are older than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1957">The ones who are Hungarian, and who are in their 70s, and some of who gave considerable amount of money to — to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1958">Who can afford to, but they do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1959">And who are — some who are not as wealthy, myself included, who would give our time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1960">I know that a number of us are volunteering in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> who are Hungarians and who are survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1961">Same thing from the survivor — child survivor group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1962">And I am —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So the — so the response to — when you ask people to volunteer has been good?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1963">ANSWER:  Not as good as I would like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1964">I would like to have more of them volunteer and more of them go out, but each year I can — I can persuade a few more people to — to get involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1965">And as — that’s always pleasing to me, and I’m always gratified if that happens — if — when that happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1966">And I’m trying to keep people’s minds out — interestingly enough, few — few of my friends who really suffered a great deal through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , are not willing to speak out and not willing to face, maybe never will face the horrors they — they had gone through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1967">And — and I sympathize and I 128November 13, 1997 understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1968">But I encourage everybody else, who are capable of talking, to — to talk to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , talk to the foundation, the Shoah Foundation, and give testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1969">QUESTION:  Can you describe your relationships with the other volunteers at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , who are survivors or witnesses to the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1970">ANSWER:  We have a very close-knit relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1971">We know, of course who the survivors are, and we speak perhaps more among ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1972">We have now a group who meet about twice a — about once every two months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1973">We have now the — the director of survivor affairs, and Martin Goldman, who is encouraging us to interact with him and with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1974">We are very concerned about the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and we are concerned about the direction the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> takes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1975">We want to make sure that the — the Jewish aspect of the Holocaust is emphasized and that the Jewish aspects of the Holocaust are not going to fall by the wayside. </span><span class="sentence" id="1976">We understand it’s a —it’s a government institution, but we still believe that the main event of the Holocaust was still the — the Holocaust against the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1977">And we emphasize that among ourselves, and among the — the visitors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1978">We do not think this is in contradiction with any kind of museum policy, should not be, and must not be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1979">And so we are — we feel that we want to preserve the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ’s main mission, which is to explain the Holocaust and show what — what had happened during that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1980">129November 13, 1997</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Do the — you think the emphasis is becoming less Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1981">ANSWER:  I do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1982">QUESTION:  In what way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1983">ANSWER:  Well, I think we have now, this year particularly, succeeded in steering the — the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1984">I was unhappy about the — the Nazi Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1985">I think it was — it make — it first of all, cost a lot of money and a lot of resources, and I don’t think it has a direct relationship to the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1986">I mean, 1t was a — an event, a Nazi event, but there were many, many, many other events, which had direct relations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1987">I am very happy now that the Kovno ghetto exhibit will come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1988">I was happy with the Fry exhibit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1989">But the — but I thought that going — going with that Nazi exhibit — Nazi Olympic exhibit was essentially going away from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1990">I was also unhappy for the same reason of that little exhibit we had, which was the faces of <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> , or whatever they called. </span><span class="sentence" id="1991">Which I sympathize again, I felt that it was a terrible genocide, and you know, I sympathize with all this, but again, that served to — to steer away the muse — from the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ’s main mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="1992">And I don’t think we can afford that, we have too many other — too — too many things which is not in the main exhibit, which should be said in the various other exhibits.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1993">QUESTION:  Such as? </span><span class="sentence" id="1994">130November 13, 1997</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, such as — what, for example was the — you know, the Jews, as victims are shown pretty well in the main exhibit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1995">But what about the Jews as contributors of European culture and science? </span><span class="sentence" id="1996">We were not victims before Hitler came; we were great contributors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1997">There is — I think the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> has that part — the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ’s mission is very integrated with that, to show that — that our contribution, our 1,000 year old contribution to European culture and civilization and technology is more than just six million deaths. </span><span class="sentence" id="1998">And I think the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> should have an exhibit for that — pretty soon, as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1999">That’s one idea, and I had about 20 or 30 other ideas which I wrote up as a— in a memo to the management, and which I submitted to the ma — high management in January of this year. </span><span class="sentence" id="2000">I really believe that they are looking at some of it, and some of these ideas are already bearing some fruition. </span><span class="sentence" id="2001">But I think they have a long way to go, and many years to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2002">And I think that — that — that management should not forget these aspects of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="2003">End of Tape Four, Side A Beginning Tape Four, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with George Pick. </span><span class="sentence" id="2004">This is tape number four, side B. Describe your impressions of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ’s non-survivors volunteer and staff, both Jewish and non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="2005">131November 13, 1997</p>
<p>ANSWER:  My impression of the non-survivor volunteers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2006">QUESTION:  And staff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2007">ANSWER:  And staff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2008">QUESTION:  Those who are Jewish, and non-Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2009">ANSWER:  Okay, yes, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="2010">I think that it 1s not a coincidence that in the volunteer corps, probably 95 percent are Jewish, whether they are survivors or non-survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="2011">I feel that, and I very much encourage anybody who volunteers to volunteer for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> whether Jewish or non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="2012">But there 1s, I think, a reason why Jews feel more of a mission there than a non-mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="2013">And I feel the same thing about the staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="2014">I am sorry to say that one of the concerns I have, and not only I, but many others, is that many of the staff, the Jewish staff, 1s leaving the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and many of them already have left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2015">QUESTION:  Why is that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2016">ANSWER:  Well, that’s a good question, I don’t — I don’t know what the answer is, but I have a feeling that the answer is very complex. </span><span class="sentence" id="2017">One aspect of that answer is that the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , in some respects become a <span class="BUILDING">bureau</span> — bi — be — is becoming a bureaucracy, just like any other bureaucracy and it kills initiative. </span><span class="sentence" id="2018">And there are some — there were some very bright people there, with ideas and initiatives, who were stifled and who were frustrated and who find — found a dead end situation there, and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="2019">They 132November 13, 1997 were not just a bunch of young people who left, whom I knew and sympathized with, and who would have loved to stay in a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> if they have seen for themselves some — some way up and some way to develop. </span><span class="sentence" id="2020">But some senior man — senior people, senior historians, who had a reputation, and whose reputation enhanced the reputation of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , such as the <span class="BUILDING">research center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2021">I was very sorry to see Baron(ph) Vaughn(ph) first of all leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="2022">I was very sorry to see when Sylvia Milton left. </span><span class="sentence" id="2023">And my fear 1s that, with these kind of people leaving the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">research institute</span> is not going to be able to attract the type of reputable scientists, such as Browning and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="2024">It is not just a matter of money, I think it’s a matter of reputation, and I think the — the <span class="BUILDING">institute</span> started out as a world class — world class institution, and I am not positive that it still maintains that status today, and I think it should. </span><span class="sentence" id="2025">And if it doesn’t now, it should certainly strive to do it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="2026">That is an awful lot that <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> needs to do, and had the potential to doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2027">I think the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> management should definitely strive to — to nurture that <span class="BUILDING">institution</span> , and my impression is that it is not doing that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2028">QUESTION:  What would you like to see them do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2029">ANSWER:  What I like to see them do is to first of all encourage and hire world class historians to work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2030">As I said, some of them already left, and I’m not positive that too many of them wants — wants to work there under the circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="2031">I think 133November 13, 1997 some enticement, grants, sut — etcetera, probably will bring some of them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="2032">But I think that there is a — a limitation there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2033">There are other <span class="BUILDING">institutions</span> who are competing for these same people, and I think if — 1f the research institute is not going to compete successfully in the next few years, they may lose that kind of brainpower, and I think that would be a great loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2034">QUESTION:  You had mentioned that you had many other ideas for other exhibits. </span><span class="sentence" id="2035">Can you just name a few?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2036">ANSWER:  Yes, well I— I believe that some of the exhibits, some of various ghetto exhibits — I think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> is — 1s a good — good — I’m sure it will be a good exhibit, but there are other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> and life in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> which were very different from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> and which is portrayed in the main exhibits, which should be shown. </span><span class="sentence" id="2037">For example, in — in west Europe, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> <span class="REGION">west Europe</span> , the ghettos were very different. </span><span class="sentence" id="2038">I think that there should be exhibits about the Hungarian Jews, and this is not because I am a Hungarian Jew, but because the Hungarian Jewish story is very different from the story of the Polish Jews or the Lithuanian Jews, and it — in my estimation it’s underrepresented in the — in the main exhibit, anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="2039">So it should — it should find someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="2040">The French Jews same thing, and — and the west European Jews, in a general sense, are also underrepresented, and they should be given at least temporary space. </span><span class="sentence" id="2041">134November 13, 1997</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Are there any powerful experiences, or memorable experiences you’ve had while you’ve been working at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2042">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2043">These memorable experiences had been very asso — very much associated with teachers training there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2044">I was fortunate to be invited a couple of times to speak to them, in a Belfer conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="2045">I was very sorry to see Marshall Sabol(ph) leave, who recognized very early on the potential of the survivor contributions to teachers’ education. </span><span class="sentence" id="2046">After Marshall left, he took some time in doing, and I must say to myse — to — must say that I was the one who forced the issue also there, until the a — the education department recognized the contribution with the educ — which the survivors could make to education. </span><span class="sentence" id="2047">But I had some memorable instances this year, when I participated in a Belfer conference, not as a speaker, but as just sitting around and listening to others, and having teachers come to me with questions and wanting me to show them the main exhibit and comment on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2048">And one — and telling me — and I have go-gotten letters from them, several, not just this year, but other years, is that their me — most meaningful experience was to meet survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="2049">That many things they could learn from books and from exhibits, but the person to person touch was — was most meaningful for them, and which they hope to transmit to their students. </span><span class="sentence" id="2050">And I really believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2051">That was certainly most memorable for me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2052">135November 13, 1997</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Are there any particular parts of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> with which you identify with? </span><span class="sentence" id="2053">Anything special there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2054">ANSWER:  Of course, I — I under — I identify with everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="2055">It would be saying, you know, if you have many children, who do you love more? </span><span class="sentence" id="2056">But despite of that, there are certain things obviously, which — which were closer — or which are closer to me than other pieces are. </span><span class="sentence" id="2057">For example, the portrait of Raoul Wallenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="2058">Obviously, the man who saved my life, directly and indirectly and who saved my immediate family’s life, makes a difference to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2059">But — but everything is meaningful. </span><span class="sentence" id="2060">And of course th-the-the large pictures which — which show the Hungarian Jews on the <span class="DLF">ramp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in the selection process, the two little boys whose bewildered faces remind me of my own, and whose uniform they wear, I had as six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="2061">I have a picture of it, and I provided that to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> to show that this was a uniform which little Hungarian boys, whether they were Jewish or not, wore. </span><span class="sentence" id="2062">And so I am always very moved by their faces, and think of me, that I could be one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2063">They of course, not survived and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="2064">And that is a very emotional thing, but for me — and a lot of people always wonder, how could I be a survivor and — and go through that — that exhibit so many times, isn’t that stressful? </span><span class="sentence" id="2065">The answer is, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="2066">It’s a gut-wrenching experience, and I — I feel that I owe that to — to the 136November 13, 1997 dead, and I owe that to myself and I owe that to the people whom I try to educate, of what it was, not just to look from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in, but what it was to be in, in <span class="NPIP">hell</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2067">QUESTION:  Be-Because of the very difficult experiences you had during the war, was there ever a time when you resisted remembering what you experienced?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2068">ANSWER:  I—I do not remember consciously resisting. </span><span class="sentence" id="2069">After the war, particularly after the communists took over in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , this was a taboo subject. </span><span class="sentence" id="2070">We did not focus at this, we had day — daily problems and concerns. </span><span class="sentence" id="2071">The memory, as fresh as it 1s 53 years later, was somehow buried for many, many decades, without losing its vividity, its — its vividness, its — its — its relevance. </span><span class="sentence" id="2072">And it stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2073">I mean, it obviously this kind of things don’t go away forever, but I never resisted it consciously, I si — I simply just went somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="2074">I — I did — and I — I must say also that my life is not defined by the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="2075">Maybe in the later, last few years it’s focusing — the Holocaust is more of a focus. </span><span class="sentence" id="2076">But as you heard it from my post- Holocaust experiences and my — my professional life, I was not — the fofo — the Holocaust did not deter me in what I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2077">I was among the probably few who ended up not in a helping profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="2078">You would be a-amazed how many of the survivors ended up in a helping profession, or ha — how many ended up in becoming a— more lawyers and doctors, and how few are engineers. </span><span class="sentence" id="2079">But I was among the ones who became the hard scientist and I felt that my real calling and 137November 13, 1997 profession was engineering and science, although I am trying to catch up now, and I am very much like — I would like to learn as much as I can about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="2080">I still do not regard myself as, you know, as a survivor only. </span><span class="sentence" id="2081">But I f— want to use my survivor status to speak, and my — my privileged voice to speak and to teach as long as I can.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2082">QUESTION:  Do you think you’d be a different person today if you hadn't gone through the wartime experience that you did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2083">ANSWER:  Iam sure I would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="2084">I think the wartime experiences has — had taught me a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="2085">Many things which I probably wouldn’t be. </span><span class="sentence" id="2086">Persistence. </span><span class="sentence" id="2087">Not be cowed by — by intimidations. </span><span class="sentence" id="2088">Sometimes recognize when a crucial decision have to be made, and I learned that heroes are not born, but made. </span><span class="sentence" id="2089">Not un — I’m not com — saying that I’m a hero, but at least I have seen heroes who became heroes, who were plain folk, and — and I brushed with death very many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="2090">So many times that sometimes I worry that I run out of luck eventually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2091">QUESTION:  Do you feel Hungarian or American or Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2092">ANSWER:  I have to tell you the — I have to tell you a little story about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="2093">You know Einstein was asked the same question. </span><span class="sentence" id="2094">The — does he feel American, German or Jewish, and he says — do you know what his answer was? </span><span class="sentence" id="2095">His answer was, well, as long as my theory of relativity holds up, the Germans will say I’m German, the 138November 13, 1997 Americans will say I— I am American, and of course the Jews will say ’'m Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="2096">But if my theory turns out to be incorrect, the Americans will say I’m German and the Germans will say I’m Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="2097">So the same way with me, it’s — I feel that the components are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2098">I am a part — I have 22 years of me with Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="2099">I have 40 years of me with American and I have 63 years of me with Jewish, and they somehow counteract and interact. </span><span class="sentence" id="2100">I — I think it is — is sort of a very simp-simplified question when one asks, who, what is, in what component. </span><span class="sentence" id="2101">I — I must say, I love Hungarian literature, and I like Hungarian art and music. </span><span class="sentence" id="2102">I love American literature, but I love a lot of — lot of other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2103">And my hobbies, for example are more universalist than either Hungarian, American or Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="2104">But I lo — but there are components of all three, which I love, and then there are things which are associated with neither. </span><span class="sentence" id="2105">For example, I — I love photography, which is neither Jewish — although there were many Jewish photographers. </span><span class="sentence" id="2106">Neither Jewish nor Hungarian were — there were a lot of good Hungarian photographers. </span><span class="sentence" id="2107">Nor American, where again, same — same thing happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="2108">My interest and philosophy of life, I hope transcends somehow, this compartmentalization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2109">QUESTION:  Is there anything you’d like to add that you haven’t said, before we finish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2110">ANSWER:  Yeah, I1—I like to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and I like to go back to a— a concern I — I had and raised and shall raise in the future, and that is about teachers’ 139November 13, 1997 education. </span><span class="sentence" id="2111">I believe that the vast majority of the teachers and certainly the students, who will be teaching Holocaust studies and who will be learning Holocaust studies would be Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="2112">I had had very uneasy few hours, few days in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> about anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="2113">And this is specifically in the Belfer conference this year, where I was — where I am — was looking at the struggle of non-Jewish teachers, trying to teach non-Jewish teachers about the central — centrality of anti-Semitism and church anti-Semitism in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="2114">And the difficulties which these teachers had with the acceptance of this idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="2115">And I was very concerned because I feel that if these teachers would simply ignore this, you know, wa — one of the — one of the teachers said well, what happens if e — we teach it different? </span><span class="sentence" id="2116">And he says, well, you have a moral obligation to teach it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="2117">Well, that’s nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="2118">I always believe in moral obligations, but I heard of very spec — spe-specific and fairly practical objections. </span><span class="sentence" id="2119">For example one black teacher got up — very few black teachers participated in this, said hey, I came from <span class="REGION">Tennessee</span> from the <span class="REGION">Bible Belt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2120">I cannot teach the Baptists that their belt — their — their New Testament is wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="2121">I can’t teach that, you know, I mean if the Jews are right, then they are wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="2122">How do I do this? </span><span class="sentence" id="2123">And I was really concerned and I am — [| think that this 1s a great central concern and should be of the education department to — to teach the Holocaust and the centrality of the a — of — of the anti-Semitism in such a way that 140November 13, 1997 the teachers can accept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2124">I’m not talking sugarcoating. </span><span class="sentence" id="2125">I am talking truth, or I am talking about acceptable ways, so they can teach it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2126">If you teach it without acceptable ways, then it won’t be taught. </span><span class="sentence" id="2127">And if it is not taught, then the great point of the Holocaust, the great cause of the Holocaust is going to be lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="2128">It’s not enough to teach what happened, they must teach why it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="2129">And they cannot shirk from the fact that it largely happened because of the centuries of art — of anti- Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="2130">But how do you package it, how do you do this so that the teachers can teach it and can accept it themselves? </span><span class="sentence" id="2131">I talked to teachers afterwards, they really are struggling. </span><span class="sentence" id="2132">I mean, they — they hear their own priests, they have their own beliefs, and then they hear this, and they don’t know how to resolve it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2133">I think this needs to be really considered and reconsidered in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and that’s not a small amount of work either. </span><span class="sentence" id="2134">That’s my parting shot for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2135">QUESTION:  Well, thank you very much for doing the interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2136">ANSWER:  Thank you for — for letting me do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2137">I-I really hope that I have pointed out some — some thoughts here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2138">QUESTION:  You certainly have. </span><span class="sentence" id="2139">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer collection interview with George Pick. </span><span class="sentence" id="2140">End of Tape Four, Side B Conclusion of Interview 141November 13, 1997 </span>
