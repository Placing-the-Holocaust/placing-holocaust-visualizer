ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Why don't we start with hearing the voices calling in Yiddish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  As we were sitting there, it was in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">In fact, I'm sure it was in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">All of a sudden we heard footsteps. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Of course, we froze. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">We thought that it's Germans again coming to find us. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">All of a sudden there were voices in Yiddish — in Jewish and I heard, “Lisa, Lisa.” </span><span class="sentence" id="7">At first I couldn't believe it and then I also heard in Yiddish saying “Jews, Yidden, Jews! </span><span class="sentence" id="8">If anybody is hiding, please answer, please answer.” </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And I nudged my little brother and I said, “Daddy,” I said, “it sounds like Aron. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Could it be?” </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And I answered and as I answered, Aron walked into the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My little brother opened up the latch and, of course, can you imagine the kind of feeling that went through me? </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My wildest dream would I ever imagine that I am ever going to see Aron again? </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And here he came really to the rescue like. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">He looked at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">By this time we were sitting there already three or four days without food, only with water, being so cramped in that there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And it was a very hard on my little brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">He was so restless and every time he had to move all of us had to turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I jumped down. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Aron took me to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , to the empty <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Of course, all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">The people were gone already by this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">He took me upstairs to an <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and he looked around for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">He looked for some clothes and he came in and he brought with him a boy's jacket and a pair of pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Women in Europe at the time, this particular time, never wore pants, and he found a scissor and he stood there. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And I was in shock, in complete shock and he said to me that he's going to dress me like a boy because women are not allowed to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">He found the scissor and he cut my hair completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">He left a little stubs on my head and I did everything that he told me to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">He put on a cap on me and as I walked down, there was a mirror and I took a look. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I took off the cap and I took a look at myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I was frightened to see what I look like without — shaven, not shaven but practically shaven — without hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But I followed him and I walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We came to the <span class="DLF">street</span> and four Jewish men were waiting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">They were the men that Aron worked with and already he had enough time to tell me that he has kept Miller, the head of the Verpflegungsamt that he works for, asked him to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and to find some valuables — I don’t know — riches, riches to enrich himself on this tragedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And he said — Aron said, “It was my idea because I wanted to come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to see if I can still find someone alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And maybe he has had an opportunity to take you out with me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="37">He told me that his mother and his three sisters are alive, that he left them in the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> because he says he could not take four people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And he says, “I could not even decide; who would I take out of the four?” </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They put in — they were carrying, — all the men had on them it looked like chandeliers, really nothing fancy to speak about. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Maybe it was old something with some wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">They took off— one man gave me a chandelier sort of — I don't know, you call it a chandelier — something that resembles a chandelier, and he put it over my shoulder and he put some wires around my neck, and we walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">All of us walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We came to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and the guard was at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> and Aron very confidently — all of us carried something. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Some of the men carried something in pillowcases. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I didn't even know what they carried there. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I learned later that all of it was for Miller, and all of us walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Aron waved confidently his slip of paper that Miller gave him to come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">They came in into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with Fritz which was one of the Wehrmacht, regular soldiers that worked in the Verpflegungsamt and he waited for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Across the way from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> directly across was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where the men that the German Wehrmacht that ran this Verpflegungsamt lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">It was Captain Miller, the head of the Verpflegungsamt and Bauer also a captain and one more, a German, and two regular German men. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So I was absolutely numb. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I didn't really know except to follow and to do what I was told to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Aron took me into the <span class="BUILDING">German's house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I could not believe why he would do it, but he didn't take me to the upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">He took me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">He left me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> within a pile of old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> that was lying there and I hid behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">All of a sudden a young Jewish boy came down and he searched for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And he said to me, “Don't be frightened, don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I will help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I will do everything that needs to be done for you,” he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And the first thing what he did is he brought me food. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">He brought me food. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And when I looked at him, he was a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">He looked to me like he was not older than 12 or 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And he said, “Don't worry, I'll take care of you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">He did everything what he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">He said to me, “There are maids working here, but I will not let them go in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Everything that they need, I will run and get it so that they won't come down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> to find you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">But all of a sudden as I was sitting there hidden, Bauer walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I didn't know anything about Bauer. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Can you imagine how frightened I was? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Here was a German came in and he found me. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I was sure he was going to shoot me right there on the spot, but behind him was Aron. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And Bauer tells me, “Stand up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And I stood up. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I stood up and he said, “Do you have girl’s clothes?” </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And I said “Yes, underneath I have girl’s clothes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Because I still had the clothes that I went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And he said — then the little boy ran down, the Jewish boy, and he brought me a babushka. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He said, “Take off your Boise’s clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Put on this babushka and come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I'll take you to the Verpflegungsamt.” </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And he walked — we walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I learned later that Aron asked Miller — he said, “I'm hiding — I brought here my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Please do something for her to save her.” </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And Miller pounded on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> saying, “My <span class="NPIP">place</span> is no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Take her out of here immediately.” </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So then Aron approached Bauer, evidently while the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was burning, and when Bauer passed by and saw the shooting and the killing...he was a decent human being and that he was terribly upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And he said, “How could I believe it that my people can do something like this?” </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And so Aron approached Bauer. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He had no alternative. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">He had to take me out of this <span class="BUILDING">German house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">He approached Bauer and Bauer walked with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Do you know the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they lived was across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> that I went to before the invasion? </span><span class="sentence" id="97">It was recess and the children were walking out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> during recess and I thought to myself, “Why am I so cursed? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">My parents were such good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I am equal to all of these children. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Why is it done to me? </span><span class="sentence" id="101">What have I done? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Then this befell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">What have I done? </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They are free and here I am being taken to the unknown, maybe to death for nothing that I have done.” </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I always thought the Jews were good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">All the people that I knew were Jewish were good. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I am sure there some maybe that were not so good, but maybe I didn't know them as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I walked with Bauer. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He told me to walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I did not have my yellow stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I walked with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We came to the Verpflegungsamt and there already the man that worked the Verpflegungsamt waited for me to come and to hide me somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They made a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">The <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> was; they took out two sacks or three sacks and they covered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They found a piece of plywood, put a piece of plywood — put a sack to cover the plywood or two sacks to cover the plywood and marked it because it was a huge <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , with hundreds and hundreds of sacks of flour, of corn, of oats, of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It really supplied the entire <span class="REGION">area</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> — that there rations were given out to the Germans, to the Pole, to everybody from this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">They marked it in such a way so that they would know where I was hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They made just enough <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> in this little tiny <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they took out the several sacks for me to crawl in and to lie there, and they left enough space of air to come in so I could breathe and I stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">When night came everybody left, and I remained all by myself in this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And as I said, I remained in the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">All of a sudden I was being scratched by rats, lying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And I was afraid that I was going to be devoured by them, that they will scratch me, eat me practically. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And with all my might that I possessed, I pushed the sacks back and I crawled out of this <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And all night long I was sitting on top and running away from the rats. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Then when morning came and I knew that they were going to open up the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , I was afraid for them to find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Maybe the Germans would come before the Jews would come into this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I crawled in again and I was able, not very well, but to cover myself again, pulling that sack to cover as I entered. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">It wasn't very well concealed but enough not to notice. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And anyway, if the Germans didn’t know that I was hidden some <span class="NPIP">place where</span> they would go and check thousands of sacks of flour to find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">The next day they already allowed for people to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">They allowed for people to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">The people that still remained hidden were told to go out from the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">They took them all to the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , the people, and they started there the selection left and right, who to live and who to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">To the left and to the right and to the left and to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I was not there but I learned about it from my father and my little brother, because my father and my little brother still remained hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And then they heard that there was a reprieve and you can really go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They came out and were told that they were going to be given a Schein, this certificate to live — this I.D. card to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">But they were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> first and there they would be given the certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And there they started the selection and somehow, somehow my father was given the card, was sent to the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> to live and my little brother remained on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and he ran and he tried to beg this Nazi, to beg him that he wants to be with his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">He wants his father and I guess in his, with all of his viciousness and with all of his thoughts of inhumanity, he found really a trace of caring. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">He threw my little brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">He grabbed him and he threw him to my father, and he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">He was let out of the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And I knew about it because one of the men came to the Verpflegungsamt and told me, “I saw your father and I saw your little brother and they were alive, and they survived the selection in the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and they are alive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And here they said that women already can live, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Women already can live, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I did not stay in the Verpflegungsamt. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">They put us up in the Beutelager'*. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">It was a really a huge <span class="BUILDING">army barracks</span> that were built for the Polish Army way before the war, and there they collected all the surplus of broken up, damaged arms from the war, Russian arms that they '4 warehouse of confiscated goods and valuables (German) collected. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And this is really where the young Jews that were involved in the underground work were able to steal the arms and to smuggle them in piece by piece into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Or in some way, Germans that were — some of them that were bartering with Jews even brought it in under boxes of soap, hidden under soap that was brought in into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Approximately, not more maybe between 800, 900 maybe 1,000 people remained from the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , from 20,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And they left a little small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , besides the people that lived in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Beutelager</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beutelager</span> where were all the young people that still worked in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Beutelager</span> or the Verpflegungsamt, and every day, every morning there was an appell!</span><span class="sentence" id="156">°, we had to go out to be counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They would come in the middle of the night with lights, have us all come out and to be counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">The people that lived on the last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the several <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> around the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> on the <span class="DLF">street</span> that's called Mostawa were given an identification, a little tiny piece made out of clay with a number that you had to wear around your neck all the time — all the time besides your round badge. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I stayed at the time in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Beutelager</span> , and my father and my little brother stayed on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mostawa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I used to go —I too had this badge that I wore and you were allowed to go from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Beutelager</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mostawa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Already my father was thinking that we must leave this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we must run away from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And my father evidently went out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and found a farmer, a woman, a farm woman that he still had some means to pay her with. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I really do not know what he gave this farm woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I don't remember what daddy still had but he still had some valuables. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I know because he still had it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that he managed to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And this woman, we traveled by horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">We went out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">We were not caught of course, otherwise I wouldn't be here to tell you the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And we were hidden under a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with hay. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">We were under the hay until we came out of the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Then she told us that we can be in the open. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Neither of us looked Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">My little brother was blond with blue eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">He was almost a towhead. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I was blond with blue eyes and my father did not look Jewish either. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">No, he didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So, she really relaxed and told us we can even be on the open and we came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">We came into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> and we were hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We were hidden, and while we were hidden Partisans came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and my little brother begged, “Daddy, let's go with the Partisans.’ </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But my father said to him, “My child, I am too old. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">They won't take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">They won't take you either. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">You are a child and your sister is a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">You entertaining an idea that 1s just a dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">They won't take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We must continue to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .”” </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volkovysk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">We came to the Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We told them that we want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">The whole idea of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> —because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> was still annexed to the Third Reich, and the killings in 1942 in the summer of '42 they were unheard of in the Third Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And we somehow heard by way of people coming — I don't know really — Daddy heard that they are not killing people in — the Third Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">The Jews are still going to work in the Third Reich and maybe they are not going to kill the people in — the Jews in the Third Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">In the beginning Daddy thought so. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Then we finally came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volkovysk</span> and we got passage and we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> to a world that already for us did not exist — already since occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Everybody was killed in <span class="DLF">pits</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And here the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was quasi — sort of free —the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working ghetto</span> — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that people did not work. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">You were able to walk from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">In fact, my mother had a cousin that lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">She was in the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with a husband and wife and two children 'S roll call (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="201">that my brother and I adored. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And as soon as we came we ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We found out that they lived in the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">We ran to them to see the family, to tell them about our misfortune, that my mother was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">My sister was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I didn't mention really that my sister was killed in the second Aktion. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">In June of 1942 they found the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where she was hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">They took all the people out and my sister knew what to expect, and she ran to the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> to run out on the <span class="REGION">Christian side</span> and she was shot on the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I lost my wonderful sister, the one I loved so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We shared with them our misfortune, telling them what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We came back to the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We came back to the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I had — my mother had another cousin in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> but they did not have enough food for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">They lived in — they had one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> for three people; husband, wife and a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">We were assigned a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We came to the Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">We told them that we are survivors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> , that everybody was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They sort of took it, almost, they didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And when my father used to retell 1t and we retold, they say, “Enough already. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Enough already.” </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And you know we were sort of convinced that this would happen here too. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">We were convinced and we tried to — Daddy especially, tried to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">To do what he can do with the children to survive but what could he have done? </span><span class="sentence" id="225">He was considered an old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">My father was in his early 50's, not quite 50, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And we were assigned a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">There were two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Three families in two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">In one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there lived a family — Lipszyc. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Herschel Lipszyc with his father that was very orthodox, and a cousin of his, that her family was already killed in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">They drove in all the Jews from a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and they set the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> on fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">She was visiting grandparents in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and she escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So she lived with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">In the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> lived a family with two children and they assigned us to live in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">We had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">That was the extent of the living that we had in this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And shortly after we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , all of a sudden, one day Aron showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Aron showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I parted with him thinking I will never see him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I left with my father and my little brother and he — all of a sudden Aron showed up and he told me — we discussed. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">In fact, when we left I told him that my father knows of a farm woman that would take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">He said that he knows somebody, a neighbor of theirs that he was very, very good friends with told him of a woman that is going to take them and then he'll give me the names so he can come too — run away with his mother and three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And then he told me in tears that he parted with them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Volkovysk</span> , because he said, “By staying together we only perish together.” </span><span class="sentence" id="245">He said, “If I want to have any hopes of survival it is only in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> — the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and if I will stay with my mother and my sisters, all of us will perish. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So I decided to run away to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> we lived with the Lipszyces, and Herschel Lipszyc was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">He would sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">He would bring a little bit of respite and life. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">It was not terrible hunger at the time yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">No, it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I couldn't believe it, that something like this still existed under Nazi occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And Aron went to slave labor with Herschel. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">My father did not go to slave labor outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">He worked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but my little brother would run out all the time, back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">He really had a tremendous courage and sense of adventure, running out all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And it 1s in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> while Herschel Lipszyc took Aron on slave labor to remodel a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for the Gestapo that Aron befriended a Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">His name was Tadek, they called him, but his real name really was Tadeusz Soroka. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Tadeusz Soroka came very often to barter with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">He would bring them food and they in turn would take out — they would wear an extra pair of pants and extra jacket on them and trade for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">He was a good friend of Herschel Lipszyc. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Herschel knew him much longer than Aron. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And all of a sudden, all of a sudden November first rolled around and they sealed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">They sealed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and transports started to resettle it, to resettle people in the East supposedly. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And rumor started in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where are they resettling the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">No one at the time thought of gassing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">No one at the time thought of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> — merely fear of resettlement. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">You were told to take a certain amount of clothes, to take your toothbrush, to take all your necessary things that you would need to go and to be resettled. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And you will even get better rations and better food. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">People tended to believe it because they thought maybe they'll be better. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">By this time already there was more hunger in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and anyway, the Jewish — the Judenrat was forced to make a list of so many people for resettling. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And it was a sign of resettling much more so only the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because they start to bring all the Jews from the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> from around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> had really hundreds of small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where Jews lived, surrounded with small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where Jews lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">They took them all in and brought them into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">detention camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kelbasin</span> and from there the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kelbasin</span> were sent first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , beknown to them where they were going, beknown to them, lists were being made and transports. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">They finished with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kelbasin</span> and they started with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Naturally, we were outsiders. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We were not natives and we were always the first people on the lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">But to our advantage was our past. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">By being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> and being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and surviving two kinds of massacre and surviving practically — sole survivors in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of thousands, of close to 20,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Out of 20,000 people, eight — 900 people survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">We really realized that we have to do everything that we already learned and the first thing is hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And we started to make <span class="NPIP">places</span> to hide and decided that we would just hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">We would not come with a suitcase to be taken to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Aron helps people find — build <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">They knew that he came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> and he knows, and the word traveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">It spread by word of mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So here he knew of a lot of <span class="NPIP">places</span> that he helped to build. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So when we knew that we were on the lists, we began to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And we would come to one <span class="NPIP">place</span> and try to hide and all of a sudden, “No, this is not safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">No, no, no, we must leave the <span class="NPIP">place</span> right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">It's not safe.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="292">We went to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and we didn't stay — to a third <span class="NPIP">place</span> — I remember one night we changed five <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">It was — we were going crazy from fear not to be caught while running out from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other, four people, the three of us and Aron. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">We survived this transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">After we survived this transport again it was sort of quite for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Respite came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And Herschel Lipszyc with a very dear friend — oh, my God, I forgot his name — Lutek. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Lutek were approached by Tadek and he told them that, “You know, you don't look Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I know of a Polish family or a Lithuanian family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> that will keep you as Christians. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I will take you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And Herschel consented to go with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tadek</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lutek</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">What were the alternatives? </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="304">If you have a chance you do it and it is for really to know that people tried to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">They took every possible chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">The chances were so few, so few. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">You needed the looks. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">You had to look Aryan to be able to survive on the <span class="REGION">Christian side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">You had to meet the right people what would keep you. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">You have to think about years, it's not days. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">This is why the righteous that saved, that kept Jews, some of them for years, are really people that are an exception in this society. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">They're giants. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">They are giants. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">They are to emulate —a whole world must learn to emulate. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">They were the people with morals with consciousness and they wanted to help and to do — do not kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Do not kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Be your brother's keeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Aron — Herschel parted with his father and his niece and his cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Aron went with him to the <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">By this time already Aron knew Tadek, and the idea was when Herschel and Lutek will arrive to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> that they will send back a note with Tadek to tell everyone that they had arrived safely. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Well, they arrived safely but they did not send the note, and Aron didn't know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">So he was reluctant to believe Tadek. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Tadek gave him the kind of story that either you want to believe it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">He said he took them to the Polish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">They were afraid to keep them because even though Lutek, his Polish was perfect, but he had Semitic looks, which is true by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">It was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And the family was afraid to keep them. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">So he said, “I took them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , to the perimeter of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="329">He says, “I show them where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is and they walked into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They told me that they would come and give me a note to give back to Aron.” </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Says, “It poured, it rained. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I waited and waited for the note and they never showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Here I come to tell you that they are in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> but I don't have a note.” </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Well, Aron already had hesitations, “Should I believe him or should I believe him?” </span><span class="sentence" id="335">But he left it. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Tadek kept on coming and kept on coming and bartering and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was not quiet any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">There were talks about transport and people already expected this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , and already they begin to loom that these people are not going to be resettled. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">That there is some thought, “They’re sending them some <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And do you know what they do to most of them? </span><span class="sentence" id="340">That they gas them. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Gas them in 20th century? </span><span class="sentence" id="342">It must be. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">How could it be? </span><span class="sentence" id="344">How could it be? </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Yes, yes, yes, yes, it can be, it can be.” </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And it already begin to work on people and people already begin to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">But so little could they have done to avoid the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So little could they have done to avoid the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">One day Tadek came and tells Aron at work, “Aron, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is sealed. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">They are taking out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> — the Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="351">We escaped the first transport of 5,000. “</span><span class="sentence" id="352">They are taking the Jews to resettlement and I doubt if you will have a chance to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Come with me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I'll take you. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I'll take you today. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Don't go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Well, Aron listen to Tadek and he said, “What should I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I have nobody in the world left. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I left a mother and three sisters in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> — on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">The only person,” he says, “that I really have ties to is Lisa. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Should I leave her too and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> , to go to the unknown?” </span><span class="sentence" id="363">By this time already he almost has said he resigned. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">He said, “What is life altogether? </span><span class="sentence" id="365">What if I survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I have no one. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">All the one — all my dear ones are gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">They are killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">What is — I still — I think I'll go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And by this time already the people that he worked with sort of were suspicious that he might go away with this Christian, and they worried because they were counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And this too — was a tragedy that we are responsible one for another. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">If 10 people walked out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , 10 had to return. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">If nine returned, they took hostages and they killed people. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And you had this tremendous responsibility of the whole community, and it's not only said that they would take hostage. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">They did take hostages and they killed people. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">They killed people. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">They came to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they didn't find a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">They found this woman outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">They dragged her into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they took out the people, the person in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that she lived with. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And both of them were hanging on the gallows for days for the Jews to see what's being done when they catch Jews outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and if they're not reported that they are missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So there was a communal responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">You were responsible not only for yourself but for others. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">That too kept a lot of people from maybe running away or doing something. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Families clung together and they perished together. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Tadek came and told Aron that he — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is surrounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">He better go with him, as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">But Aron decided to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">He came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">He was immediately arrested, taken into the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> , and he looked for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">He didn't find me, because when this came — that the transport that are coming to grab people again, my father, my little brother and I went to hide again. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">We really did not have a very good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">So in our <span class="DLF">yard</span> where we were living was a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Again, there were <span class="BUILDING">shacks</span> where before the war people kept wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And again, my father and my little brother and I crawled up in a little <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , in a wooden <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> and we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Police came and knocked, “Your number is up. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Anybody hiding come out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Of course, we froze. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">We didn't answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">The Germans came in and knocked and searched around. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">They did not come with sniffing dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Were they come to sniffing dogs though, they would probably would find us. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And we remained there. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Aron searched for me in the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">He didn't find me in the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> so he didn't know — either I was killed or hiding or whatever had happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">The massacre — the transport went on for quite a few days and finally, it came to astop. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">A handful, about 800 maybe, people survived, maybe close to a 1,000 people, and as we were sitting — you see the <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> where we were sitting faced the <span class="BUILDING">Synagogue</span> and we saw all the thousands of people being led to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , being led, this march, this endless march of people being taken to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">We — all of a sudden we saw Jews running and carrying a little bundle and we realized — and they were talking loud and we could hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">We realized that it's over and, you know, the talk was — evidently — people that wanted for other people that were hiding, to know that it's safe to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">So in Yiddish they would say, “Come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">It's safe, it's safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Git aroys, Yidden.'</span><span class="sentence" id="415">® Git aroys, git aroys.'’ </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Come out, come out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="417">When we heard this, my father said, “It's safe to come out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And we came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">We were practically numb for lying like this all curled up. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">We came down and we came and we realized that the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived in — it was a two story, it was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> really. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">There were two <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> together — that people were running to these <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">So we realized evidently that these are the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> they left for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Yes, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">There were three <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that were left and one of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> was our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , where we lived before. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">So we went upstairs and as I came in upstairs, I found Aron there. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I could not believe that it could be true. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I could not believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">For sure I thought that he 1s already taken in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> and I never, ever see him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">He came with another man, that he told me the story how he was saved when this man let him build a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> under the coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And that now we have to do something very fast, to run '© “Get/come out, Jews.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="431">Yiddish) 'T Get/come out (Yiddish) away from here and our only salvation is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tadek</span> , that we must get in touch with Tadek and run out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Well, my little brother went out and made — Aron had the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">He was always ahead in his thinking so he knew where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tadek</span> lived and the address. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And my little brother went out to meet Tadek, and Tadek told him that he would take him and my father to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">He would take them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> that are traveling between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> and he would let them — if they arrived safely, hoping that they would arrive safely, he would bring them into the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Let them walk into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And it was a designated day that my little brother and my father left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to go and to meet Tadek. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">They came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tadek</span> and Tadek said that on that day he could not take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">That he would take them the next day, that there was no transport going. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So they went to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">They were hiding in the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that was completely empty overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And the next day they met Tadek as he told my little brother where he would be and they would travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Tadek again told them to stay in a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> — to stay in a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> that was right next to the <span class="DLF">yard</span> to the <span class="DLF">railroad yard</span> , and then when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> begins to move a little bit to jump on and to try to crawl on to the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Well, my father listened and when it was time to run out, he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">He did as he was told, but he would not step on to the two couplers and try to go up to the top of the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , and he said, “Even if I have to be caught and killed, I cannot go to the top of the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I cannot do it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So they were hidden on a flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> that was traveling to the front — <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> that were going to the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> and covered with tarps, so they were hidden under the tarps and they somehow made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">They somehow made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">They were searched. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">They searched — there were <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> — the flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were being searched to see if there was anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">By this time already there were Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">There was already danger of Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">But they didn't find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">They arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">They got in into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">They found Herschel and Lutek in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and my daddy send a note with Tadek to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aron</span> to tell that he found Lutek in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and Herschel and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tadek</span> is for real and to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And then it was our turn to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I went out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">By this time the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was very small and guarded, and I went out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to establish a contact with Tadek. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I came — I found him and he told us to come on a designated day, on a Sunday and then he would take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I came back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I told Aron that I met Tadek. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">He consented to take us and we'll go out to meet Tadek. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But not only Aron and I, but we were eight or nine people. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">One of the people that we met was Elkie Jezerski, that knew — he said that he knows of a janitor that used to be a janitor in their <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where he lived, and maybe we can hide there and wait until Tadek can take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Eight people went out, not with the idea of all of us to go but maybe Tadek would take them one-by-one. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Meanwhile, they would establish a contact and they know Tadek and they will stay with this janitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Elkie had a feeling that the janitor is fine and he would keep us. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">All of us came to the <span class="BUILDING">janitor's house</span> , and at midnight the janitor decided that he does not want to keep that many Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">It is dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">We must leave his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">He said, “But I'll keep the girl.” </span><span class="sentence" id="472">He wanted us to leave right away and it was curfew so we begged him. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">We begged him to let us stay until it gets a little in the morning before sunrise, while it 1s still dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And he kept — he let us stay and all of us went out of this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">He took us — the janitor took us to a bombed-out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I went with them with the idea that I can stay in the <span class="BUILDING">janitor's house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">janitor's house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I met Tadek at <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Tadek told me that he would take us on a Tuesday. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Here it was Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I came back to the <span class="BUILDING">janitor's house</span> and the janitor sent out his wife and the children, and I was not thinking at all, not knowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I was a child yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">He wanted to rape me or to kill me because he was sharpening knives. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I had the presence when I heard knives being sharpened, that even though I was locked in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> — I was locked in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> when he sent out his wife and two girls, I had the presence to run out. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I ran from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and in my chase running out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were flimsy even though the <span class="DLF">door</span> was closed and with a latch, but I went out with all my strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And I slammed the <span class="DLF">door</span> in such a way that by the time he opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , I was already a distance from him, from the janitor, and my luck was that there were <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">It's hilly. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">It was very — it was hilly and there were <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and there were <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> on the sides of the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">He ran to chase me. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I was faster than he and when he came about the middle like, of the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and where there were <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , he was afraid because they shouldn't tell that he's chasing a girl or maybe it's a Jewish girl or something, so he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I ran to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where the rest of the Jews — Aron and the others were hidden — to tell them what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">That we cannot leave tonight. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">That Tadek will take us Tuesday and that the janitor, either he wanted to kill me — I did not realize that he wanted to rape me — that he wanted to kill me. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And I ran away, and what are we going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="495">We decided that we have to return to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">We cannot stay there until Tuesday, until Tadek would meet us. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">We had to return to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because there was an empty <span class="DLF">yard</span> and children were playing ball. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">It was a bombed out <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were open and we were about to fall in into this <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , into this <span class="DLF">hovel</span> where we were all of us hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">The children would run <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and say, “The Jews are hiding there, so many of them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="500">We were afraid that they would give us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">We had to wait until night came and we went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">We could not remain one day of the danger that loomed <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">We came in back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and Tuesday as Tadek told us to meet him — told me — to meet him in the <span class="INT_SPACE">public washroom</span> at seven o'clock at night in the evening, and he would take us — when he said would take us, he only meant Aron and myself but five people went out — not, not two. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">One of them was Ruby Loren, the man that Aron was saved in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , his cousin, and another young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And the reason the five went out, because we wanted the other people to have this contact to be able to go with Tadek another time — to know him and where he lives and so forth — to establish a contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Five of us came. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">It was dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">We came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">public washroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Dark, seven o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Tadek was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">He told me that he would be dressed in a uniform like a railroad worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">He would have a flashlight. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">He would light the flashlight so I would know that that was the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Exactly there, seven o'clock, the men were in a <span class="INT_SPACE">public washroom</span> in the middle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> on the <span class="REGION">Christian side</span> , naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I waited for Tadek. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Tadek came and I tell Tadek that we are five people. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">When they were hidden in the <span class="INT_SPACE">public washroom</span> , they looked out of a little <span class="DLF">window</span> and when Aron saw that Tadek is there, he went out to talk to Tadek and he begged Tadek to take another person. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">He tell them that, “I was saved with this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I really don't want to part with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">He was good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I want to be good to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I want to take him with me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="523">But Ruby didn't want to go because he tells Aron, “The only person in the world is left is my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I don't want to leave my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I want to be with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I have no one left in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Everybody in my family is gone already.” </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Aron tells him, “Look, Ruby . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">They will come Thursday. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Tadek promised to take them Thursday. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">You have an opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Come. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">They will come. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">You'll be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Come.” </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And Ruby was standing there sort of halfway with his cousin, halfway, when Aron grabbed his hand and took him with and he went with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">The others returned to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="538">They never were able to make the trip because for them, death came. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Resettlement came before they were able to go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and to meet Tadek again. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I walked with Tadek. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Aron and Ruby followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">They were both very Semitic looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">They wore Polish looking hats called maciejéwka'*, a kind of hats that Poles wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">We were not stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">We came to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Tadek pointed out to us the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> that was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> — from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Within the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> , also there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger cars</span> that the Wehrmacht — that the Germans traveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">But we were to travel — Tadek told us that when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> began to move already at a little speed to jump out, to try and grab, to run up between two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couplers</span> and find a little <span class="DLF">ladder</span> and try to crawl up to the top of the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I listened and I had it all in my mind to do it the way Tadek said. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Aron went out first and he was able to do it and went up to the top of the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , I learned later, and Ruby, I guess, did the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I remained in the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> , or lying in the <span class="DLF">road</span> , I remained in the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I turned my head and I saw so few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> left. “</span><span class="sentence" id="553">Oh, I will remain. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">It's the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">It's the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I survived until now but I won't survive anymore more.” </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I ran out and I have not been able to find the two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> with the couplers, but I saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> with a <span class="DLF">door</span> and, you know, it had a handle, a little <span class="DLF">ledge</span> , and I grabbed on and I stood on the <span class="DLF">ledge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I held on to the handle. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I have not been able to go on to the top of the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , and there I was standing with my feet, wearing mittens in sub-zero weather, holding on. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> began to accelerate, add speed. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I was already frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">The wind tore off my babushka and I couldn't hold on much longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">I couldn't and I couldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">By this time already I wish to be killed so it would be over with. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And all of a sudden I heard a noise on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I heard a noise and it sounded like somebody is sort of on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And then it got quiet and I still was holding on. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I learned later that Tadek came to find his passengers on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">He found Ruby and he found Aron lying on one <span class="DLF">roof</span> on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">He didn't find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">He asked, “Where 1s the girl?” </span><span class="sentence" id="572">They said they don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">They still left her in the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> and they don't know what happened to the girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Tadek did not give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">As the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was moving and moving very fast already, he jumped from one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> to another until he came almost to the end of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the almost of the end, and he saw me standing there holding on yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">He ran for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> where Aron and Ruby were on. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">The three of them jumped <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> after <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Youth was with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">They were young. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">They were able to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">My father could not do it and a lot, a lot, a lot, of people could not do. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Children and woman could not do it either. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">You had to be young to be able to do it and to know that there was a Tadeusz Soroka. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">This were not that many Tadeusz Soroka. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">They came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> that I was still standing and Tadek leaned over, gave me a hand and told me to hold on to his hand, that they will pull me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I had a vision that he will grab my mitten and not my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And I said “I must do everything that I possess not to lose his hand.” </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And I managed. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">The three of them pulled me up to the top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> and I '8 visored cap (Polish) traveled with them, the three of us on this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> for 180

<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  We're going to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">End of Tape Number Two. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Tape Number Three
QUESTION:  Now, you're just about to arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So tell me what happens then and how you end up in the Resistance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> and we were able to go in into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> without any problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Tadek walked with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">He told us to cover our faces with soot so we would look like railroad workers coming from work or something, and he said, “As soon as you see a group of Jews returning from the nightshift, from work, try to jump in, in their midst and walk into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And we walked with Tadek for awhile and all of a sudden we see a group of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Of course, worker Jews because they walked in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , not on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> and they all had yellow stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">We went into their midst and we walked 1n into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">This was the last time on this voyage that we saw Tadek. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">We came in into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and Jewish police immediately took us over. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And as the Jewish police took us over they took us into Dessler'? </span><span class="sentence" id="604">and to Gens”° in order for us to receive rations, a piece of bread that everybody needed and a bowl of soup and also, a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to put your head down. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I'm not talking about a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , but a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a piece of <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> to put your head down. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">You had to be registered within the Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Dessler cautioned us not to tell anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Of course, we told him the story, that we are — about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> and we still had a story to tell him about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Also, he said, “You have to be very quiet, not to tell people, not to put the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in a panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Not to put the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in a panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Here it's different. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Here it's different, and don't jeopardize your ration cards and do as we tell you to do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Needless to tell you, neither of us listened to what he had to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">We spoke our mind and told people exactly what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> , what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> , and by this time already people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> knew too, because it was already after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ponar</span> and a lot of killings in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> but the situation there was still different. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was still vital. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">There was still quite a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I was immediately — I was told where my father and my little brother are and I immediately ran there to be with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Can you imagine the joy of my father to have me come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Now, Aron immediately found a group of people that came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">They were together with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">There were nine men and a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I was the only girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">So they all lived together and they were called in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> “The Grodno Group.” </span><span class="sentence" id="625">They all sort of were dressed the same and they were called “the Grodno Group” and they all lived in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">They had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with another married — with a couple and the couple's sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So you can imagine how many people in one, in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> — people went out to work and there was a lot of cultural activity in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that came to me as a total surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">There was a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> where you could go and take out books or sit and study. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">There were children playing ball. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">There were competition and there was a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I couldn't believe it, that this was possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">There was a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">This was such an unknown experience to me that I felt like it was a different world. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">My father worked outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So did my little brother — used to go out and I too, for the first time went out to work outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I worked in <span class="BUILDING">hothouses</span> where they raised vegetables for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">For —I guess for the German elite, whoever, the Gestapo, or '9 Saulk Dessler, head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius ghetto</span> ’s Jewish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">°° Jacob Gens, head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius ghetto</span> ’s Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">whoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">The leader there was a — the foreman there was a Lithuanian man and he knew some of the Jews that worked there, so he wasn't very harsh on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And the Germans didn't watch us. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">We somehow could always, always finagle a little bit, where we could steal a radish or a carrot and eat it real fast and try to get rid of the green part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And it is there where I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">The man that was our foreman, the Jewish foreman, always used to go away and leave us. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I was very, at times, angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I say, “Why does he do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Why does he do it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Little did I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Much later in the underground where I met him that he was part of the Jewish resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">But I didn't know when I worked with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">The man never told us or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">He evidently was trying to do something for the resistance on the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">So I worked — Aron worked inside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and very much our hope was only the resistance and the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">We knew that we can not survive in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And because it was still a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in numbers and there was still quite a young people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we tried to look every possible way to get in touch with the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Do you know, before the war was known for this — it was called “the Wilno Jerusalem of Lithuanian.” </span><span class="sentence" id="658">There was such a strong nucleus, culture in Jewish and in every, every aspect of Jewish life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> that we were convinced that there must be an underground there. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And when Aron worked with one of the men in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> he realized that he's — that they do something there. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">That it's always producing a part, a part, a part and the minute the foreman, the German foreman, would walk in they would immediately hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">He learned later that they were making some parts for armaments in this <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , that they were really working for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And besides Aron there was another man that had contacts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> and from both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , somehow, they contacted the Jewish resistance and the resistance took us in because they were all young men, unattached with no families, and we became part of the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">It was very, very secretive. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I could not tell my father, neither I could tell my little brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And then the story of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenberg</span> ”’ developed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where a Communist, a Polish Communist was caught on the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and within his torture he gave out Wittenberg as the leader of the Jewish resistance in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Now, the Judenrat played both ends of the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">They were with the resistors and they were with the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Gens had a notion because in 1943 when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> in March, then April, May, June, the Germans had big defeats on the <span class="REGION">Russian Front</span> already and Gens had a thought that if the resistors do not bring in the destruction of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the people might survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Maybe liberation will come and everybody will be liberated, not only the couple of hundred young people, resistors. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">So he wanted to convince the resistance to “don't rock the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And even though he knew there was resistance, so he played both ends. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">But he convinced the population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that, “the resistors will bring down your end.” </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And the population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was with Gens, unfortunately, not with the resistors. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And then this tremendous play with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenberg</span> developed and as we know from history now from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno ghetto</span> that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenberg</span> was turned over to the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">He committed suicide and Abba Kovner’’ took over the leadership, but at a time when the leadership decided not to *! </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Yitzhak Wittenberg (1907-1943), leader of Jewish underground in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> . *</span><span class="sentence" id="677">2 Abba Kovner(1918-1988), Jewish-Lithuanian resistance fighter and Israeli poet. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">give out Wittenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">They called us to come in the <span class="DLF">barricades</span> and to fight, to raise a fight with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Of course it was futile. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">We all would have been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And when we came to this designated <span class="NPIP">place</span> I realized the strength that the resistors had because they were so big in numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">They really did not have much to fight with in arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Of course not. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">It's a David and Goliath fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I mean there was an army with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , with all the supplies in the world, and we only had our bodies, a few grenades and something that we wanted to give our lives — to show the Jews fought back, that we fought back, that we achieved at least something. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And as history tells, Wittenberg and I tell, Wittenberg was given — there was a big discussion among the leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">We learned all of it later after 1t was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">We were not in the leadership position. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I was a 16-year-old girl doing what I was told to do and really being so grateful that I was part of the resistance and did absolutely everything that I was told to do, and I knew very little except what I was told to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">QUESTION:  This time when you all came together, tell me more about when and where that was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  That was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that faced the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and it was at midnight like, late at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">From all sides group start to converge to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and as we came it was dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Maybe there weren't as many numbers, but I conceived it as a tremendous number, two — 300 young people that came there and some of them were walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Some of them had a grenade and somebody had a pistol. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And we already, our group, too already possessed couple of pistols that we really bought on the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , smuggled it in and paid with hunger by not eating, by not having that slice of bread to be able to obtain the pistol. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">It was an exhilarating experience to be there, even though that we knew that we would all die, because we were no match, we were no match. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">All of a sudden we were sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">We didn't know the drama at the time until the next day when it developed that Wittenberg decided that — they came to him with the thought and told him what it entails. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And Gens told the leadership, the resistance leadership, that if he doesn't give himself up, they are going to come and destroy the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And there was a lot of people, Jews, running in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> screaming “Wittenberg, Wittenberg,” for him to give up. “</span><span class="sentence" id="702">He's bringing the end to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">He's bringing the end to us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="704">Little did they know that the end was coming anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">But when I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , my thoughts were altogether different. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I was the enemy of these people that said for Wittenberg to give up and to — not to rage and to fight, not to fight back because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> will be destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I thought they would be destroyed anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">The end will come anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">But for the ones in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that still had children, every day meant something and Gens kept on saying, “If we live through this period, maybe we can still live through the liberation.” </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I began to appreciate it many years later when I had a family and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And I know that you were to be responsible, not only for yourself but you're responsible for your family too. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">You cannot run out. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">You can only do it when you are a youngster, leave your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">You cannot do it when you are a parent. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">There is much more responsibility expected of a parent. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And then the decision was, after the Wittenberg affair, of course, Wittenberg was taken into the Gestapo and he was given poison and he committed suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So they really got nothing out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wittenberg</span> as far as questioning him and for him to give out secrets or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">And then the thought was that we cannot wage a war — warfare — in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">The population is not with us, is not with us, and the only solution would be to send the resistors into the underground in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> to fight from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And little by little, groups began to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">How did they go? </span><span class="sentence" id="722">It was a 180 kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">The closest the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Naroch woods</span> where we went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Groups of 25, 28 or so were sent with guides. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Who were the guides? </span><span class="sentence" id="726">The guides were Jewish Partisans already that were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> and were already, so to say, “free people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="727">They took upon themselves the risk of being killed to go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and to lead groups of Jews out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="728">What courage! </span><span class="sentence" id="729">What heroism to do the kind of, really, thing that you risk with your life to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">They were giants, giants of men. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Giants, lions, young dedicated, fearless, that came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Some of them were even arrested in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and then let out. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And they took groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Some of the groups that went out before us met up with an <span class="DLF">ambush</span> and were killed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">QUESTION:  Why don't we actually start with, let's start with the resistance to take taking you with them because you were a girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">ANSWER:  After we contacted the resistance, I really was not one of the people that contacted the resistance, but it came from two different <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Aron knew somebody and our friend — another friend of ours that was from Grodno, that knew the resistance, knew somebody in the resistance already, and finally we were able to join the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">When it came the time to really go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , there was a discussion that among the Grodno group there was a girl and they were not so keen of taking the girl, to leave the girl behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Little did they know that I could do everything that these men were doing, even more, and I was really at no time at all any liability to anyone in the underground — just the opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">But Herschel Lipszyc, our dear friend Herschel Lipszyc, stood up and he say — they call me Liska(ph) — “If Liska doesn't go, none of us are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">All of us are going and Liska 1s going too, and this is the way it is going to be.” </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And because he was so very positive and naturally, Aron very much wanted me to go, no question. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I mean, I joined in group because Aron was part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">On my own, I don't think I could have reached the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">So finally they consented that they'll take me too. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">We would be going to the underground to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naroch</span> and we would go with a group of 28 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">So on a designated day there came a call that it's time for us to leave for the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">All the Grodno people, the 10 of them lived together, so the call came to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And early in the morning, about three or four o'clock in the morning, there was a knock on the little <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> we lived in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with three more families. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">There were practically corpses all over the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , to walk out. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">It was time for me to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I have not been able to walk out because I would wake up all the people that want to know, “Where are you going in the middle of the night at four o'clock in the morning? </span><span class="sentence" id="754">You can't go to work that early.” </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I slept in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> with my brother, and Aron knocked on the <span class="DLF">window</span> and he said, “It's time to go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I have not been able to go through the <span class="DLF">door</span> , so I had to slip out in the tiny piece of the <span class="DLF">window</span> , the little <span class="DLF">window</span> that opened up for air. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Luckily, I was so thin and so small that I was able to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I have not been able to tell my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Neither did I tell my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">I only told him, “When I am gone, tell daddy that I have left — that I left.” </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And he says daddy will know where I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">So that my little brother was intelligent enough to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Can you imagine? </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I left without telling them because it was so secretive. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I wasn't able to tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Were I to remain, who knows if I would have survived and I wanted to go so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">The leaders were the two men. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">It was Shlemke Hilczyk and Motke de Geller — Motke the Red. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Really, I can only speak about them in superlatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Only super giants, men that were ready to give their lives to help other Jews in need. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">They were already free people when they were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Of course, they could have been killed but they were not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Their dream was already accomplished. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">They were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">They were fighters. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">They came to take out groups of Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to lead them in into the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="777">It took us seven nights to walk to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Twenty-eight people left. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Among them were women too. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I wasn't the only woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">I was the youngest, that much I'll say. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">I was the youngest in the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">The first night when we came out we went out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> as a group going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">We came to the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="785">We were hidden in a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wooded area</span> , hardly wooded enough not to be seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">There were shepherds with the flock. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">We took them with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">We kept them the whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">We did not harm them. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">We blindfolded them and we kept them there, and when night came, when we left this little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , we let them go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And we told them under no circumstances are they to tell that they were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> with some Jews, because they will be punished severely. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">We showed them that we had weapons, and we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">We walked with this man that took us — that supposedly knew the <span class="DLF">road</span> and they got lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">They had no compasses, only by the sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">We tried to go with <span class="DLF">side roads</span> , so we would not be seen and identified. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">But as we were going on the side <span class="DLF">roads</span> we only got lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">We got lost and we had to cross a <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> on the other side of the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="798">So he decided to go on the main <span class="DLF">road</span> where Germans were traveling, and every time, he told us, we see approaching <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> with lights to drop in the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And one by one we crossed the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> while German guards were standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Every time the guard would turn to the back towards us, one of us would slip out. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Twenty-eight people had to cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Imagine the danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And all of us crossed safely. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Part of the way when it began to get light we were running, not walking, but running to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">The day we hid in a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> we started out walking again and we had problems again. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">The <span class="DLF">road</span> wasn't so clear to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">They came back from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Somehow they knew their way but they had to — maybe —had to change the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">They took another <span class="DLF">road</span> and two nights in a row we were lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">They never lost their cool. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">They always kept us convinced that they know what they're doing and they will bring us in a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And we had the total confidence, total confidence, in these two young men. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Finally, they decided after the second or the third day they decided to take farmers to lead us, to be our leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And the farmers knew the way and we told them to bring us to the next <span class="NPIP">stop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">They told them to bring us to the next <span class="NPIP">stop</span> , and the farmers listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">The farmers listened and brought us to the next <span class="NPIP">stop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="817">They were cautioned not to give out the Jews, that this is a pack of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">The farmers knew very well and somehow we made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">We had to cross two <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> , and one <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> a farmer took us and we were all walking all the way up to our waists. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Some of them didn't know how to swim. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">They were worried that they would drown. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And we made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">The farmers said, “The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> is not very deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">You will make it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And he was right, we made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">We came to cross the big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Viliya</span> , and the Germans were standing guard on the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , and when they heard the splashing of the water from so many people walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">They began shooting at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Fortunately, their aims were poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Nobody was killed and we crossed, and finally the two leaders start taking <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> with farmers, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , and they put us up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="830">And we traveled on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> already, until we came to what is called “<span class="REGION">Partisan Territory</span> ” where there was a tremendous number, already, of Partisans and it was safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">This was <span class="REGION">Partisan Territory</span> so it was safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And it is there, while we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> traveling, all of a sudden we were stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">We were stopped by a Jewish Partisan riding on a horse with an automatic rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Can you imagine our joy? </span><span class="sentence" id="835">I will never forget this moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Never, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Leibke Gordon on a horse with a rifle, with a machine gun, greeting us, falling all over us, kissing us, we kissing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">He was like Messiah. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">We came to the Promised Land and they brought us into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">The guides waiting for permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">They didn't know the password. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">You had to know the password. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">They didn't know the password. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">They were stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">They told they are going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to bring Jews to the Partisans, so they were let in and then we were let into the base. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">We came to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that it's — how could I describe this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="847">It was like Robin Hood. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">There's people walking around with rifles. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">Sides of cows are hanging that were being slaughtered for the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="850"><span class="BUILDING">Huts</span> — we lived in <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> that were built. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">It was hilly so they were built in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> made out of logs, dug out, you know, made out of logs. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="853">A long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> that was not for twelve — how could I describe to you the scene as we came down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I seen a Robin Hood. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">People walking around with rifles, sides of beef hanging, <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> , people coming out of the <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> milling great number of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I never could have believed that this is the way the underground, the resistors, worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I thought they lived hidden in some kind of a small little <span class="NPIP">place</span> away where nobody could ever find them or such. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">This seemed to be so open. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">It seemed so open and we were welcomed right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">The leader — we came to a Jewish unit that was called “Revenge” — “Nekamah” in Hebrew — and the leader was Joseph Glazman**. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">He accepted us with warm arms and right away everybody wanted to know who we saw, the last people that we saw in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And we learned that it wasn't that simple for Jews to be in the underground, in the Jewish unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">That the Russians would not give them any arms, enough in the unit, and the thought was they met up — they told us they already met up with Antisemitism and the Russian unit is separately, and they look down upon these Jews that came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="864">After all they are ghetto Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Little did they know that these ghetto Jews knew how to fight and were better fighters at times than the others were too. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And very shortly, very shortly — the spirit was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">It was sort of free. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">You felt free even though you knew there were dangers, that there were Germans all the way around. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">But you felt free and I kept on thinking, “If people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> would only know that something like this *3 Joseph Glazman, Jewish partisan and leading member of the F.P.O. existed, they would all run, they would all come.” </span><span class="sentence" id="870">But I knew very well that they couldn't run and they couldn't come. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">It's only the select youth that were able to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I knew it but you thought both ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Very shortly, very shortly this Jewish unit was disbanned, was disbanned under the pretext they are training the Soviet Union, all the nationalities mixed together. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">There isn't such a thing as a Jewish unit — it must be integrated unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And, of course, they sent away most of the group to be ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Actually, it wasn't so much a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camp</span> because there were hardly — we did not have any children in this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">But also the artisans are people that knew how to sew. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">They made them because this was the Jewish elite that came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> , the Jewish elite. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">They send them in to bake bread, for the woman to peel potatoes and to sew, to make boots for the Partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">I don't know — sew their uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I really don't know and there was a tremendous anger among the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">People felt so reyected. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">They felt it was so unjust to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Here people came to fight and they were sent to be ina group. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">They gave some of them weapons so they can defend themselves in case they are attacked and also to go out to the farmers and get food — to get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">After a while there was no alternative. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">People got adjusted, but they felt 1t was a tremendous injustice. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">All of us felt it was a tremendous injustice. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">We remained in the unit and we were the first among the Russian units, in a lot of Russian units. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">But our group, that were in this Jewish otriad”*, remained with the Russian unit and it was called the Kalininski Otriad and, of course, we met up with Antisemitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">With Antisemitism women had a very special strike against them. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Nobody thought, the leadership and even the soldiers, the resistors, did not think that women know how to fight, know how to do — when you need to go on a mission or something of this sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And they told them, you know, to do kitchen work, to do this and all sorts of menial jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And some — then Glazman took a group of really the most outstanding young men and women and they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">They were so really hurt that this could happen to a group that was so dedicated, that was so knowledgeable, that had all the potential to do everything that was asked of resistors to do, that they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">They left to go to the other groups that left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rudniki</span> to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> , to the “Pushcha*? </span><span class="sentence" id="898">Rudniski” it was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">In English they call it <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rudniki</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And on the way they ended up, they met up with an ambush and they were all killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">One young woman escaped and she came back and told us what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">How they were killed and things and exactly what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Very shortly after, we were dispersed within the groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">I was always within the Russian unit with the Jews that were remained in the <span class="BUILDING">Kalininski Otriad</span> and whatever it was asked of us to do, we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">We did it very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">What do the Partisans do? </span><span class="sentence" id="907">They really made it impossible for the German Army to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">We cut down <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and blockaded the <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="909">We mined the <span class="DLF">entrances</span> to where the resistors lived and this was called an otriad, the units where they lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">They cut down <span class="DLF">telephone wires</span> and they made ambushes at times; dynamiting the <span class="DLF">roads</span> , dynamiting also <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that went to the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">In the very same token, we helped Jews that were hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> because there were Jewish, young children and also elderly people, women that escaped, wanting a family that ran out of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that either burning or everybody was being killed, and quite a few children. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">I mean not in large numbers, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And we saw — they lived at first almost like wild — running from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> and hiding and never having enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">Some of them even died. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">But when we came into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , we made sure ** military detachment (Russian) °° virgin forest (Russian) that the farmers keep them and they watch over them for their safety because we threatened the farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">If something will happen to their safety, you will be punished and punished severely. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And you'd be surprised, they listened. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">Because they knew that we had power. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">There were sieges every so often. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">There was one tremendous siege 1n the fall, a little bit later in the fall in 1943, where the Germans that were going to the front had to come through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and we lost a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">A lot, a lot of Partisans were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">A lot of them were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">They systematically walked through. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">We were hiding on an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> that was covered. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">We thought was safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">It wasn't at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">After we came out of there we realized that we could even be seen from the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="928">But somehow we survived, but 20 — we survived but at least between 20 and 30 percent of the Partisans we lost in the siege that were killed, that were lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">We returned back to the base. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">The base was not touched. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">They never came to the base and nobody was on the base. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Now, the leadership, the leadership took it first a group of Jewish young men and I was left to guard, to stand guard for the leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And after the danger really came that they realized that they cannot travel in a group with more than two or three of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">They ran away hiding some <span class="NPIP">place</span> with farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">They changed their clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">They were after all, they were Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">They were Christians so they didn't have this danger of being Jews and hiding among farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">They left. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">They left, disbanned all of us, and told us each and everyone to go and look out for ourselves and it will be over to come back to the base. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">We came back to the base and we found, for a while, no one. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">After a while the leadership came and they start dropping now leaders from behind the <span class="DLF">enemy lines</span> to be our leaders, and we begin to grow in numbers and everybody was armed because the arms were being dropped from behind the <span class="DLF">enemy lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">We made an <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">air drone</span> like where we cleared out part of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And at night on four corners of this meadow, we would light fires for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> to identify where to drop the shipment of arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">So Jews and no Jews, everybody got armed. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">The others always were armed. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">It's just Jews, always the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And time went on and at big battles they would organize two or three or four units to come out together. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">At times we just walked and walked for days not knowing what they were doing and what was going to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">But somehow we always came back to the base, and later we would learn that this was sort of an exercise of a sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">Nobody questioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Nobody questioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">We did what we were told to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Time went on and I have to tell you that one day as I was on the base, somebody came running to me to tell me that my father came into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I left my father and my little brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="955">When one of the groups went — guides went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> I begged one of them, begged to tell my father that I am alive and that I am in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Naroch woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="956">He told my father; he went to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">I told him the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="958">I told him the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we were, and my little brother was caught in the <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilno</span> while they were grabbing the people and was sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Estonia</span> , and then added up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="959">My father was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he remained all alone, and when he learned that I was in the underground in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naroch</span> , he walked all by himself, dressed as a Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Luckily, he came to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="961">He lived in a <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> that we provided him. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">He and three, four more people that lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">We provided food for them and safety. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">They knew that they were safe as long as we are in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> around them. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And my father lived there until liberation and he was liberated together with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Liberation came. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">There were battles. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">I did not participate in the battles because it was really the big units that 1t was done, combing through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="969">We remained on the base and the last time before liberation some of our closest friends were killed, while they were combing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , to put up, to catch some of the Germans that were escaping from the front or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And we lost quite a number of men, and the men that we lost were our close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">There were battles that the Russian Army waged and summer of 1944 we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">We were liberated and we immediately — most of the men were drafted into the army, to the Russian Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">We — my father and I and Aron asked for permission just to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> to see somebody survived maybe from his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">He was granted the permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">In the Soviet Union you couldn't travel as you wished. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">You needed a permit and you had to show the permit everywhere you went. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">We were given the permit and we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">I knew that I would not find anybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> but we still had hoped. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Daddy told me that my little brother was caught on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , that maybe he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">Maybe he's alive somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">Maybe he wrote to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="982">So we came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the man of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that we lived in was killed by the Nazis because he was a Communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">The wife and the two children survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">We left a lot of our belongings — when we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> — was left there. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">We were absolutely, penniless, without anything to change — anything to wear, only what we had on our backs. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">And we asked to try and give us something that was left in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that belonged to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">The landlady, the woman of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> said, “Nothing at all is left and everything was taken away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="988">The only thing she gave me is a slip, an embroidered slip of my mother's that I treasure ‘til this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">It was the only thing that I remained with, the hand-embroidered slip. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">We left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">There were no Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="992">However, I found a note from a cousin of mine that was saved deep in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kazakstan</span> , looking for us, if anybody survived from the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">So I immediately was able to get in touch with my cousin Harold Brenner that lived, that was still survived in deep in the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">We left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slonim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="995">We stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baranovichi</span> for a short while. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">We were taken in by Jews that survived and all the survivors became like a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">Everybody took in everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">Everybody shared with a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">You were so happy that somebody survived, because whoever survived thought that he was the only person that survived — that everybody's killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">The joy that you found something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baranovichi</span> and my Hebrew teacher survived and he met us on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">The joy of having Meyer Chalasnowicz survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">He took us into his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">He shared his food with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And as <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was liberated, we left the Soviet Union as Polish citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">We were allowed to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">Aron left first on New Year's Day of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">My father and I followed right after, right after, and we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> there was danger again of being killed, again, after the war by pogroms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">They talked about pogroms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">They talked about killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">It didn't materialize in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> but it was in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> that we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">And it is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> that we start searching a way how to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">There must be a way to get out and to get to the West. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And Aron especially, we met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">We came right after and Aron had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he took us in and we stayed there and Herschel Lipszyc stayed there, and whoever survived from the Grodno guys stayed with us and we were like family, like family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">What I wanted to add that before we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> to tell <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tadek</span> that we survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">When we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> , my father, Aron and I — Herschel Lipszyc was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> — and Herschel Lipszyc said, “Well, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Grodno</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">We said, “We came really to tell Tadek that we survived.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">He said, “Yes, I already talked to him and he knows.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">He says “imagine.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">So we made a party. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">A party, really a reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Tadek came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">We kissed and we hugged and the men drank. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">There were other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">He brought some vodka and there and the men drank, and there were other people, the Jews that survived, that everybody really shared in our joy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">And everyone made a tremendous to do over Tadek, to tell him how much we appreciate what he did, even though it was only one night in the chain of events. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">If it weren't for this night, who knows if we would have survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">The same goes for the first woman that kept my sister and myself in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">If it weren't for her, I don't know if I would survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">If I would be here to tell you all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">Was only one day, and by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tadek</span> it was only one night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">What are the other nights and the other years that it took to survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">Yet, without this chain, were the little link broken, I probably would not maybe be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">You needed somebody to give you a helping hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">The tragedy was there were not many helping hands, and the ones that helped, again, are the giants in society. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">They had the moral fiber. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">They had the conscience, the feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">They were real people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">The way I would expect people to do in case of need. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">And in general, to have morality because were the Germans moral, this would not have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And it is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> that we began to look a way to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And again, there were rumors that there is an organization that came, people came from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">They're trying to lead the survivors, get the other survivors and see if they can takes them to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">This was something sort of unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">How could it be possible? </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">But you know, after a while we learn that it is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">People told us by word of mouth and it wasn't that, really, secretive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">It wasn't announced in the <span class="DLF">opening</span> , but neither was it secret because they were very anxious to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">And Aron through Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir, again contacted the B’richa”° and with the help of B’richa we start to getting out, to getting out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">We left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">My father remained behind for the simple reason that he had still hopes to find my little brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">He said, he will stay and see what he can humanly possible to see if he can find his little brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">He said already, “I will manage to get to you later.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">We came to — from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> we met a greater number of young men and women that Aron knew that were members of the Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir and that were friends of his and his sister's friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">And we traveled with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">We were given passports as Greek Jews, and we began to travel from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and where ever we went we met by the B’richa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">They somehow arranged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">There were other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">The entire <span class="REGION">European continent</span> , people were traveling in en masse, going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">Everybody had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, but the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">They were going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rumania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Everywhere people

evacuation of Jews from post-war Eastern Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">grabbed on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">People were hanging on the outside of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> and in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">There were no tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">People just traveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">The Red Cross announced, too that they had facilities, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">We were given really passports by Red Cross as refugees, and we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Graz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">From <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Graz</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Graz</span> we had to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and to cross to get to the <span class="REGION">western zone</span> of <span class="REGION">occupied Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">We did it with the help of the B’richa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">They led us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">A group before us when to go through to swim through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">Some of them drowned and they decided to hold off and to send the rest of the groups through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And we went through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> with leaders that led us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarvisio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1081"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarvisio</span> was already <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">It is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarvisio</span> that we met up with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span> was part of a Palestinian Jews that volunteered and they had a hard time to be accepted as a unit to the British Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">And they were wearing these insignias here, the English insignias, but here on the sleeve they had a Magen David — a Jewish star. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">Can you imagine from wearing the star in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarvisio</span> and to see Palestinian Jews wearing it proudly on their sleeve? </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">The transition that it took in us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">They were absolutely — they did everything humanly possible to do everything for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">They fed us to the point where all of us were sick, because we were not accustomed to the rich foods that they tried to feed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And they did everything possible that they could to alleviate our worries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">I immediately found somebody that knew my sister that came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> rejoining me, Slovaki (ph) and he was able to send a telegram to my grandmother in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and my aunt and uncle and my aunts and that
