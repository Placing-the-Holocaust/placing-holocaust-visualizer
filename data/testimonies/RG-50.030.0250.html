<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">We are beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Would you tell me your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  You are starting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Uh, huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Uh...My name is Guta Blass Weintraub. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My maiden name is Blass and my married name is Weintraub.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  I was born...born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , the second largest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called L O D Z, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> [ 6d_ in Polish].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  In what <span class="NPIP">year</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  It was...uh...January 22, 1924.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Would you tell me about your family and growing up in_6d_?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Well, uh...basically my life was, as a child, was sheltered and beautiful and I remember only wonderful things about my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I had very caring and wonderful parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My father...uh...was a very educated man, and uh...he had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> of...uh...uniforms...uh...sort of like...sol...for soldiers or like...uh...boy scout uniforms also and like preparatory ..uh...school uniforms...uh...and...uh...we were slightly upper middle class family, basically fairly well-to- do. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I had a younger brother and...uh...we had a very good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We used to go..., my brother went to...uh... <span class="BUILDING">Jewish private school</span> where they learned Hebrew and...uh...so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We went to a <span class="BUILDING">private kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I went to...uh...uh...regular ...uh... <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> which was...uh...only Jewish because this is the way the system was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that...uh...the Jews had their own, ...then their own <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and the Polish people had their own <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And the reason for that, evidently, was that the Polish people were not going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Sundays and we did not go on Saturdays. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So it was like, ..-uh ... basically...uh...helping us not to be sacrilegious and so on, so it was good and we felt good about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Of course, as far as antisemitism 1s concerned in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I as a child could...uh... notice things quite a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I occasionally would notice or hear that...uh... someone...uh...Jewish was beaten up or that...uh...you know, something...uh...little <span class="BUILDING">schul</span> which was, you know, a small little <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ...uh...that was...uh...vandalized or burned or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Those were little things and...uh...and my parents tried to ...uh...shelter me from it and for me not to, you know, grow up with a complex of these things but I knew of tt. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I...uh...when I was growing up,...uh...children, Polish children my age...uh...some let me know and would say something bad, "You Damn Jew" or something like that, to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">But...uh...the majority did not because maybe children did not to such extent understand antisemitism or practice it as the older did, olders did. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So, that was it and...uh...I don't know what else I can tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Life, in my opinion, was beautiful and...to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Of course, I know that there were...uh...people of lower financial class that maybe did not have it so good in...in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but they were also people upgraded...uh...as far as financial situation and so on is concerned and they most probably had even a better life...uh...but... uh...I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I know it existed, but I don't really...I have not experienced it. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We used to go every summer...we used to have a <span class="BUILDING">summer home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Uh...We used to spend our summers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And a funny thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I visited <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> two years ago, and I visited all those <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It was a very emotional journey for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Of course, I still feel like it isn't enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I would like to go back and see more of it, because I spent a short time in these <span class="NPIP">places</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So maybe I will do it some day again. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And then I...uh...the first year, I started going to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> which was a private and only for Jewish girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It was a girls' high school and, like I said, private, but unfortunately it did not last too long because the Germans entered...uh...my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in September 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Of course, we still went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for a couple of months and...uh...but as...uh... time went on, the Germans started occupying...occupying...uh...pri...buildings that...like <span class="BUILDING">school buildings</span> , <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , <span class="BUILDING">government offices</span> , and so on, and they settled themselves in our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">They only used the third and...uh...<span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , and we had the first <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But it became dangerous because we had to use the same <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> and on some occasions...uh...we have heard that...uh...some girls were abused by the soldiers so for that reason alone, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It would have most probably lasted for another month or so, but it was too dangerous and it wasn't worth it. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And...uh...so I stopped going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Uh...
QUESTION:  What was life in _6d_ like right after the German occupation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Well, right after... Now first of all I would like to describe the entering of the Germans and slightly prior to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I have heard that the war started with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and, of course, all the soldiers were going toward the <span class="DLF">German borders</span> to defend <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But it seemed like...its...they just simply turned back, and they were running. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Uh...a day or two prior to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> of the Germans to _6d_, the Polish Army, without actually having, you know, without fighting, ran back and they were passing through our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And they were passing through our <span class="DLF">street</span> and they were heading somehow toward <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I will never forget that day because what...what we did, ...uh...we were preparing sandwiches and food and we were giving it to the soldiers as they were going toward <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> [the Polish army was retreating eastward in an attempt to avoid encirclement by the Germans]. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">There were some that...uh...foresaw what was coming for some reason...uh...that also ran to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Many of those survived and they escaped <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But for a family with children, it was difficult to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So basically who ran away is young women and young men that were unattached and many majority of them survived if they could survive the winters in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Of course, the Germans practically were near...uh... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> [only briefly in early December 1941] and...uh..of course, the Jews were running away and Jews at that time, somewhat were persecuted by...by the Russians also. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So, but it still was evidently much easier to survive than to go on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> where a majority of... uh... people perished in <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">The Germans have entered 6d.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">QUESTION:  Uh...What happened to you and your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="64">What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We stayed there until about the end of...the beginning of December, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And at that point my father thought that it was too dangerous to stay in_6d_, that there were talks about making a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in one part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where the poorer people...where the poorer Jewish population lived, and they were going to push everybody in there...uh...and since my Mother's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik-Starachowice</span> , and my Mother still had relatives living over there, we...we thought that it would be easier for us to get there and, you know, we were hoping that the Germans would not be able to follow us. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I mean it was just a dream that, but it...uh...they followed us, but a lot later and in the meantime, we were still able to exist as normal people without being thrown into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  How did you exist? </span><span class="sentence" id="70">How did you live in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  During that time? </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Well, we...we did not take much with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Whatever we could pack on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And, of course, the...the journey on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> from...uh... 6d_ to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> was very unusual too because we were...we had to hide and we had to...uh...sort of...uh... pretend that we were not Jewish and the way we were doing it is, my father used to live during World War I in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for some reason I don't understand why. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">He was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but he lived for some time in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">He spoke a perfect German. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">As a matter of fact, a German with a dialect, which is very unusual because if a foreigner speaks...uh...German he will not speak with a dialect, because it is very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So he spoke with a dialect and I learned German in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I also was able to speak with Father some German. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So we were able to sort of make believe that we are either of German descent or mixed Germans which they sort of, kind of, you know, were lenient with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And we arrived to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where a German family .... Well, actually not all, also mixed-Germaan ... Germans hid us for a day or two until we were able to continue by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> to...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And since it was winter time it was a very difficult journey because the <span class="DLF">roads</span> were not cleared of snow, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> was slipping and sliding, and the horse were...was...uh... tripping and it was a very bumpy, bumpy and bad trip, very cold and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But finally we arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> , and...uh...after a little while.... We lived for sometimes with relatives,...uh.. but later on, we were able to rent an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> for ourself and we lived, so.... We had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and my father was a designer. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I don't know if I mentioned that to you, but he was designing military clothes for the army before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">He was also designing sportswear. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Also...uh...boy scouts uniform and... and...for <span class="BUILDING">preparatory school</span> uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So...uh...since he had the knowledge of...of making patterns and...and able to understand how to do things and so on, and I somehow always liked to sew, so we were doing some sewing. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Father used to make the patterns and doing things like that; and I, under his instruction, would sew the garments and we were able to make some money to sustain ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Because all we needed at that time was just to buy potatoes and...and bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">That was our daily...uh...food, whatever we could make with it, because meat was very scarce and if there was any meat, the Polish people would get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Somebody that had influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">In order words, people that grew up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and so on, knew the natives, the Polish people, and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , they were able to sort of obtain other staples of food...of food and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">But since we were strangers, things were a little bit more difficult for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Uh...later on, I...uh... decided that I will open up a little <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , and take care of small children for still working parents because it was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> yet in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and we were just restricted as far as the time is concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">In other words, we were not able to get out of our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> before a certain time, which I imagine was 7 o'clock in the morning, and we had to be in our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> at 5 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But, of course, people still continued working and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">There were a lot of tailors, shoemakers and...uh... merchants in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and whatever else, just like it was before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So they continued to serve the community and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And I...uh...the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> that I opened...it was in my own <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which was consisting of one large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="99">cough) Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">But usually, we would clear the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and push the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> back, and then accept the children at 9 o'clock and I would take care of them til 1 o'clock; and that helped the family survive because...uh... the kind of parents of the children would occasionally bring some articles of clothing, or extra food that they were able to get, you know, like meat and things like that, and they were paying me a certain amount of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And I was doing it with another friend of mine who was the same age. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We were about 16 at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Unfortunately, this young lady was killed by the Germans later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So, this is how we tried to sustain ourselves during the time until...until the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed and until they took us into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  How was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> formed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Well, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was still...uh...not terrible, by comparison to..to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">In other words, we were still sort of free, but we have to abide by the rules of the Germans and..., but we were moving around freely in the area of our confinement; and we were still together, which was the most important thing, my parents and my brother and I. And we...our lives were still sort of normal because we were able to get together with friends, with relatives, and amazing thing that all through our confinements in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> or even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> is the fact that... uh...we were..., the Jewish population always had a sense of...of wanting to learn...of wanting...of...you know, wanting to have knowledge, so we did not stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So, in...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we were...like for example, I continued...I was teaching young children in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Someone else, who had a little higher education than I, was teaching me. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Of course, we all had to pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And I remember I...I was taking algebra and continued with my German, although I spoke German well, but I...I needed to improve it, 1n...1n writing and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And we were... even took Latin. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I took French, and we were able to...to get together and sing Hebrew songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So it was important because we were still together. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We were not torn apart, and therefore...uh...life seemed to be normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It was very...uh...very special, too, because we...we valued each other much more than...than... It made us think, altho... although I cannot say that we valued each other more. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We just understood it better because family ties were very close among Jewish family...families in Europe and...uh...ties with friends and relatives were also extremely important. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And that was what was sustaining us and making our life bearable, that we did not have the comfort, we did not have...uh...the opportunities; we did not have a million things that we had before, but it did not seem to matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Under what circumstances and when were you taken from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Uh...I will never forget that morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Usually they...there were no announcements...announcements from the Germans of their plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">They usually did everything totally unexpected. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">If anything ever leaked out, it was either a gossip or...or it might have been some truth, or the times did not correspond. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So...uh...but we knew of...we heard of other people being...uh...transferred to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> ; and there were many people that were transferred from small little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik-Starachowice</span> into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and they were all...uh...you know, put into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And things were getting tighter and tighter, because we had to share our little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> with another family and another family. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And we realized that it will not last...last like that forever, that things were getting worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And, of course, the food situation was getting worse because of the incoming of so many people from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So...uh...we prepared ourselves, like for example, we made knapsacks for...for each one separately, and had them packed with the essential clothes; and my father, whatever little money we had, distributed the money among all four, amongst all four of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">That way that if we were separated that we should have the money to be able to help ourself. (</span><span class="sentence" id="132">Cough) Excuse me. (</span><span class="sentence" id="133">Cough) Anyhow, so basically we were prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We were not able to take any extras because we knew we couldn't carry it. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Uh...so we left our household goods, our silverware, even a photo album which was so...so dear to us we had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">But I managed to stash away some pictures in a bag and kept it hidden... uh... and sure enough...uh...what happened is a few days later at 4 o'clock in the morning, the Germans at the same time knocked in all the <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">The reason for that is that they did not want us to have the opportunity that one should find out, hear from the other and have a chance maybe to...of escaping. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So, at the same time, they had hundreds and hundreds of Germans with dogs knocking on people's <span class="DLF">doors</span> and screaming, "Out! </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Out! </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Raus! </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Raus!" </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So many people, if they were not prepared as we were at that time, ...uh...ran out with basically nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And then they ran us all together and gathered us on a <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Each small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> that was, you know, usually the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in Europe had this point that was called the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So we were all rounded up there and at some point, they had Germans doing a selection: right, left, right, left. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So what was happening (cough), they were selecting younger and stronger people to remain in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they were distributing them to those three <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that were located in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">One <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">woodwork camp</span> where they were cutting wood; and before the war, I imagine they were making <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">But during the war, the Germans confiscated it and they transferred it for their war purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was manufacturing boxes for ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">They were manufacturing...uh...um... <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> for the soldiers, and...uh... other things that were helping them for their war ...uh...purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Then there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp...</span> uh...nearby in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> where they had a <span class="BUILDING">steel factory</span> ; and...uh...all the Jews were ordered to work in the <span class="BUILDING">steel factory</span> , also manufacturing things for the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was nearby the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and they were over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And there was also one other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I don't know what specific purpose this particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And they started selecting. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">My father and my mother, my brother and I were standing naturally together. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">When they came to us...when one of the Germans came to us with a dog and with a big...uh...switch that they used, you know, for beating horses when they were driving <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> and he wanted to separate us, my brother and I they left in the <span class="DLF">line</span> , and my father and my mother they pushed 1n the other <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">That means they were going to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , you know, instead of going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Uh... someone who was...they had Polish, they had Jewish policemen ...uh...1n our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp...,</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> actually, to keep order amongst us, and they were evidently...uh... helping the Germans keep order during this ordeal of selecting the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So, ...uh...one of the policemen...was a very good friend of my father's from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and he realized what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And he came running and took my father and my mother out, and put us together. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">My mother at that time must have been maybe 36, 35--something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">My father was a couple of years older; so they were not old, but this 1s what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So temporarily we were staying together. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Later on, what happened is the same policeman, ...Jewish policeman, had a son also who was my brother's age and at that time, he found out that...uh...the Germans who were stationed outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that they confiscated from well-to-do Polish people, needed boys to do their cleaning, shoes and whatever else they needed them to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And this policeman thought it was a good idea and safe for my brother and for his son to go over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And he explained it to us and they took my brother and his son away. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">But we were not frightened because we knew that they were going to be safe, which was true. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So my father, myself and my mother were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">woodwork factory</span> , and...uh...they had...uh...set aside a big <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> that they separated by a <span class="DLF">door</span> and one part was for women, one part was for men. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">So I stayed with mother; and, of course, we were the ones that...that made the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , you know, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And I was working, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And ...uh...we were all at that time being given food that was...uh...cooked for us by a group of people that they selected and they were cooking for all of us, for the men and for the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So it wasn't too bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I...when I think about it, and...and the reason I say it wasn't too bad because I am still comparing with the times to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">So, we were able to survive because we were receiving bread, we were receiving soup once a day; and in the beginning, I was working in the <span class="DLF">gardens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">They had <span class="DLF">gardens</span> over there, which there were...there were some Germans on the grounds of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that...uh...that we needed to supply with fresh vegetables and...and whatever fruit was growing and other things, so I was working in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Later on, in the winter, of course, there was no work in the <span class="DLF">gardens</span> and so on, so I was working in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ...uh... supplying... uh...the wood to the machine and...and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And there were other skilled workers that were doing other jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And in this, I would like to say something very special to me how I met my future husband, but I have to go back a little bit to the time of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">While we were at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , uh...they...people were coming from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and my husband was among the people that were shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bodzentyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">This is his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">It's spelled B-O-D- Z-E-N-T-Y-N. And...uh...he was always...they were well to do at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and they evidently brought in some money and some means that they could somewhat survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Uh...and one day he came to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> --which was, you know, the place where we already lived separate-- but it was on steps from the <span class="DLF">street</span> going into our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And he heard evidently of my father and he came to us and he asked my father if he could make a one-piece suit for him with a zipper and then he requested...uh...many pockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And, you know, I will mention once again that that was before they chased us out to the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> , before going into the <span class="BUILDING">woodwork factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So...and he explained to my father that he wanted pockets <span class="NPIP">inside</span> that they wouldn't show on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , that he wanted some pockets on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> because he wanted to.... He didn't explain that he wanted to hide things, but we knew; and...uh...we did that and he paid us well, and he was a very, very handsome young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">He was older than I. At that time he must have been maybe 21 and...uh...maybe 22 or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I...I don't exactly know. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And he was very handsome and he came in and he sat on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> and he explained to my father all this and he was sitting with a sack of apples and he was eating those apples one after the other and I looked at him in amazement. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">First of all, we didn't see apples. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">We were not able to obtain apples, and he evidently got them. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">He was very...uh...he was always able to...to manage things. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">He was very...how to say?... </span><span class="sentence" id="195">uh... innovative? </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And he always...always had ideas how to accomplish things or how to obtain things, and how to do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So...uh... evidently he didn't understand that when we looked at him eating the apples that...uh...1t was a novelty to us, but later on when he finished describing what he wanted and my father took measurements and so on, he...when he left, he left the remaining bag of apples for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Well, that was the very, very first time that I saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Uh...it was...I didn't think much of him because, you know, when somebody is 15 or 16, you know, somebody that much old...he was 9 years than I am, you didn't think of it in...1n any other way, just as a nice good-looking person, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">When we...uh... went...I am returning to that...they called it "Aussiedlung" [NB: "Resettlement" ]...means to move you out from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another, means like to displaced person and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">When they moved us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ...uh...after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp...</span> uh...after I stopped working and during the time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , it became obvious that we needed some medical help for people because there was always somebody that would cut their fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I remember to this day, one person, one man, had cut off two fingers but they were still hanging and he didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And they asked...they asked if there was anyone who has any knowledge of first aid. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And...uh...I did have very minimum knowledge of it, and I didn't know it was going to be like gluing two fingers together...I mean the fingers together. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">I expected maybe a cut, a bruise that I could just use the basics and when this person came to me, I almost fainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">But what I could understand myself...I mean I put the fingers together and...and put the...whatever medication we had and taped it together. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Well, would you believe that the fingers grew together. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I am not sure to this day if the bones grew together. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">He had the fingers, but he was not able to move them from the first <span class="NPIP">joint</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">He moved them in the second <span class="NPIP">joint</span> where he it was not severed, you know, injured, but he couldn't move... but he had fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Well, at that point when they realized that I knew something of it, they had supplied me with first aid articles; and I was doing it not all day, because they could not afford for me to...to get away from the work, so like for a couple of hours a day people that had some problems that I some idea to...to help...uh...that I was doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">In the meantime, why I am getting into it because there 1s a story going to be connected with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Uh...next to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zeork</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">It's spelled Z-E-O-R-K. Uh...1t was a electrical plant. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Well, this plant evidently...um...occupied a very small number of Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Uh...they didn't need such great...uh...work force that they needed in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Among the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zeork</span> was my husband, and a elderly doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Why I say elderly, he must have been in his 40s, but he was elderly to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Uh...Well, he was a friend of my husband's and...and he evidently said he was his assistant. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">My husband had fantastic ideas of trying to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So as a assistant, they did not part him with the doctor and it was asset to have the doctor in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Well...uh...a few weeks later, for some reason, they liquidated this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they evidently knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Uh...But within the time that they were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we heard of them, we tried for the doctor and his assistant to come to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because we needed him more than what he was doing over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">So twice a week the doctor and his assistant, Leon Weintraub was his name,...uh...would come to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they were assisting people that needed more professional help than I could give them. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And, of course, I was present since I was in charge of the first aid, you know,,...uh...box and so on, so I was assisting the doctor and the original assistant of the doctor was not assisting. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">He was just running all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and trying to meet up with the people that he knew because there were some people that were from his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And also, his father and his brother were in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So naturally he was always bringing things and this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And then at the first meeting, of course, he had to come, so he met me, again. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And since he knew me, he was telling us...he was telling me, "Oh, you did my suit; you see, I am wearing it." </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Of course he never told me what he had hidden in the pockets and...and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And he would see me on occasions until the time that they were going to evacuate his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Well, the night before the evacuation, evidently the...the...guard... the German that was...uh...administering, or you know being over...overseeing our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , knew about the liquidation of the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and he wanted the doctor to come and be with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">He made them come the day before. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So he came to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and he was with his father and his brother and...uh...I would like to mention that his father survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">His brother survived, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Of course, by now his father is not living anymore because he would be maybe about a hundred years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Uh...But they survived the war, and we were together in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Uh... well, and I got to know him. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">On occasions here and there, and we...we kind of became very fond of each other; and he was also very instrumental in helping my family, 'cause since he had evidently money, he was able to obtain some goods from out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and always got something extra like a bread or maybe other things and would give it to my mother and father and they...they had to promise him that he would not tell me, they would not tell me, because he did not want our relationship be affected. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">In other words, that I should not like him or whatever it 1s, should not influence my feelings toward him by the fact that he was helping us. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And I didn't know any of it at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Uh...After a few months... uh...we heard of...uh...the liquidation...no, not the liquidation yet! </span><span class="sentence" id="247">But the mistreatment of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where...uh ... they were working in the...uh...<span class="BUILDING">steel factory</span> , and also at that...before then...uh...they for some...there was a typhus that broke out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself and the Germans felt like...uh... I don't know if it was their concern that they were going to lose enough...too many workers by the typhus...breakout of typhus or so, so they decided to do a selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And...uh...see the ones who looked sick or old or whatever it is, they were shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Uh...By that time, my brother was already transferred to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because evidently they had no use, the Germans who employed these two young boys had no use for them, so they put them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Uh...well...
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Which <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp...</span> in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , but this 1s the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where they were going to work for the...uh...<span class="BUILDING">steel factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And that's where the typhus broke out, and this is where they did the selec...selection, and killed off many Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">My brother survived somewhat, because...and he had typhus at that time...but evidently he was young and he was able to control himself and he was dressed well in a coat that was twice the size and...uh...1t was rather well-to-do looking coat, with a hat and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And maybe it was his luck that they did not shoot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Well, they shot a whole pile of...a whole number. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Why I say pile? </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Because they piled them up on [and they threw them] in a <span class="NPIP">corner</span> , and I don't know what they did with them, whether they buried them or burned them or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So we heard...heard already of the mistreatment and the atrocities that were going on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and we tried to bring..., and people in our...uh...<span class="BUILDING">factory</span> tried to bring--because many of them had relatives and friends--and tried to bring them to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Well, through our...uh... German on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we were able to get many people from there, and among them my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Well, it seemed like it was...things were.... Since we were together, we didn't understand the pain of other people separated or other people...uh...having lost their lives in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Uh...It's human nature that you only worry about your circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So we were content. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Uh...It was difficult, but with a little help from Leon, who became my husband later, with a little help of a...a kind person in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that originated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> and was able to obtain some food and so on, we were able to not go around hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Uh...There was...uh...also a incident and I still have those shoes actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">My husband noticed that I had very bad shoes on...uh...and the most important thing--since we were being transferred to unknown <span class="NPIP">places</span> --the most important thing was to have a warm coat, good clothes and shoes that did not leak water. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">So he...uh ... ordered. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">We had a little shoemaker that was able to do wonders, and the shoemaker made shoes for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Little shoes like the kind you use for horse back riding out of all leather and everything, and I had those shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Uh...Then came the time where we heard that we were going to be evacuated again somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We had no idea where. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Uh...And of course we all sensed...there was so much talk by that time already... People were coming into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , running away from different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and so on, and they always had some news, believable or unbelievable news cause we tried not to believe the horrors. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">We only wanted to believe the good things like...uh...for example there were some incidents, while in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp still,</span> that all of a sudden some Germans would come and say...uh ... "Is there anyone who has relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We have <span class="DLF">openings</span> for...uh...these people to be able to transported to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> that their relatives are paying for it." </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So it sounded logical. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And...uh...we remembered that two people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that evidently had no connection with anybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> like relatives, evidently they were alone, that they mentioned that had they had a sister or whatever and those people were taken out with all their belongings and everything and they were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So...uh...we were always reluctant in volunteering to...to do something when...whenever it sounded too good. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Because we didn't trust them. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Uh...Then...uh...also there was a horrible incident during my time in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and there was a group of people that was really very sick and delirious with fever of the typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And my mother was among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I...uh... had no knowledge of the fact, and I had no understanding of the fear of being infected with the...with the illness; because of my mother, because I wanted to be with her and I wanted to help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Therefore, I didn't even think of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And I was the only one that was assisting all these sick people. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Unfortunately, the doctor himself got ill and he was among them and...uh...there was also a brother-in-law of my future sister-in-law that was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And...I mean, I knew all these people and without thinking I offered that I was going to take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I took care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">My mother came out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Many other people survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">What I was basically doing 1s...uh...helping them...uh... to sponge when they were hot and...and perspired and feverish and I was also trying to feed them, which was helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And, of course, all of them most probably would have survived, but after releasing my mother and some others there was small group left; and this German was terribly impatient and he didn't want to wait any longer and he said, "These people are going to be taken away to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Well, there was no <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that I knew of, but we believed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">He said it was a temporary shelter or a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that we were going to that they are going to be taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Well, we were ordered to make <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">We had to carry the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I myself with other party carried the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> of one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And...uh...but we did not go to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">They took us straight to the <span class="DLF">grave yard</span> ...<span class="DLF">Jewish grave yard</span> , where there was a big <span class="DLF">ditch</span> dug and...uh...they told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">You know, the people could not walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">They couldn't stand up. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And they told us to place the people, you know, like at the edge of the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> ...ditch where they could simply shoot them and kick them 1n, and this is what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And we witnessed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Later on I will tell you of the fact that I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to be a witness and I...I apprehended the German who was instrumental in shooting all these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But any...this what happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="304">What else significant happened?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We came... Unfortunately, it was a tragedy for everybody because they were relatives of people who were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And...uh...we...we were deceived, because we did not...uh...believe that they were going to do something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">We trusted that they were going to...to take them to...uh...uh...<span class="NPIP">place</span> where they would treat them. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Uh...And when we knew that we could trust them, whatever they were ever saying...uh...1t was never so. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Uh...but...uh later when I...I must return...return to the point where I came to the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to help...uh...the sick people over there with typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Since we were doing it in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , I went to help the people with typhus over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I couldn't do very much, but it was that I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And at that time, I made sure that I took my brother out and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">During that time when we had to stay...spend a night over there because it was a long ways to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">We were...had not, no transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">We had to do it by foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So we returned the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And during my stay there I came across this German...uh...he was actually a Ukrainian, from <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , but...uh...the Germans employed them and...uh...they were even worse than Germans or as bad as Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And...uh...suddenly this guy for some reason took some liking to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I had no evidence of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I didn't know, and didn't think nothing of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I didn't even know. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Well, one day he comes...uh...to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">It must have been...uh...a reason, either he transported somebody into our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or...or vice versa, but he came and came running through the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Uh...And I mention it to you how it was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">It was a long....uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hall</span> that was separated by a <span class="DLF">wall</span> and <span class="DLF">door</span> where one <span class="NPIP">side</span> was for men, one for women; and he came running through the...uh...<span class="REGION">area</span> and started shouting my name and screaming, "Where is the beast?" </span><span class="sentence" id="336">In German he spoke, he said, "Wo ist die Bestia?" </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Well, he had...uh... immoral intentions and we all knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And he said, "If she does not come, I will shoot everybody." </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Well, of course, he must have been drunk...uh...because it was...his behavior was...uh... totally out of <span class="NPIP">place</span> even for a German or...or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Uh... But I knew that I must do something because he would not hesitate to shoot somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">So I came up to him, and I started speaking to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I says...he understood my Polish and, of course, we couldn't correspond in German cause his German was worse than mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">But we spoke Polish and I started kind of minimizing...uh...what he was...uh... showing, what... what...what impression he made on us and what he was planning to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And...uh...and I talked to him very kindly, and this and that, and I told him how glad I am to see him again since I saw him and I, you know, fenagled the whole story. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Uh...and he was trying to kiss me. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But he didn't even do that because I kind of...and it went by. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">It went by. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And everybody at that time was hidden, because they were sure he was going to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So that...uh...1s gone..so. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And, of course, later on like a week or two weeks later, ...uh... came the...uh...evacuation from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">The reason I mentioned, I want to say it because that way you can connect it later on with a situation later on with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  What is his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  Schrot. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">His name is Schrot. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">S H...No. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">S-C-H-R-O-T. And there's going to be quite a incident with him later on, that therefore I mentioned him. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Uh...they evacuated us, but in a different manner. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">They came...we had...uh...like about 300 people in...in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they brought <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> covered with a canopy, and they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Our...we did not know where they were going to take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">When they took us to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">It's spelled M-A- J-O-W-K-A. Uh... When we got there we could see from there...uh...the fires going from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ...<span class="BUILDING">steel factory</span> which impressed us terribly because since we did not know exactly or maybe I was the only one that didn't know, but this is my impression that still stays with me to this day, that this was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and that they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> where they were burning people. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">That was my feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I did not share it with anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Everybody saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Maybe some other people were also thinking the same way, but I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Uh... when we got there, there were <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the people that were already there...uh...from the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp--</span> we were the last one to come in--were in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> so everything was closed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Uh...But at the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> , there were two very long...uh... <span class="DLF">graves</span> dug and when we got there, it was the same Schrot that was in charge of this transportation from...uh...the "Sagewerker"... or in Polish, it's called "Tartak," T-A-R-T-A- K. That means <span class="BUILDING">wood factory</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="369">NB: Actually, the correct translation of both terms is "sawmill''] Uh...He was the same one, and he was in charge of transporting us to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">When he told us to get out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and he says in German, "Women on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , men on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Make a <span class="DLF">line</span> in fours." </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Then and he stood at the end of the <span class="DLF">grave</span> and said to us, "You have one minute..." He said it in German, he said, "You have one minute to say your prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">You'll be shot." </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Well, naturally we all believed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">I mean it was... uh...if I had to describe my feeling 1t would have to take hundred pages to really, one-by-one, to describe what I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But my utmost feeling and reaction was my concern first of all for my parents, for my brother, for my friends, for everybody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So what do you do in a case like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And he also saw that I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And I also knew that this was this animal that was capable of doing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Uh...I was 1n the third row and my mother was standing near me and I realize how terribly disturbed my mother was. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">How her facial expression has changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">How her color has changing. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">She was looked like a ghost. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And all could see is her heart going strong under her thin dress and it was so painful to me that I...I didn't know what, but I knew that I had to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So I jumped out and jumped straight...he...he didn't expect it. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And I jumped straight to him and I knew that if I approach him from the front I have no chance of doing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So I jumped on his back. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I...uh...put my fingers around his throat and I started choking him. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I jumped with my legs and I put them around his mid-body. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">It's just like piggy back playing with a child and that's how I hung to him and kept on pushing my fingers into his neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">My finger nails were even longer than now. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Uh...and, of course, since I...my grip was so strong and he couldn't walk because I had my legs around his, we both fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And I still didn't let go because I knew if I let go 1t was going to be the end of me and especially the end of everybody else there. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">So I did not for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And...uh...finally, they...they couldn't shoot because they were afraid that if they shoot, they may shoot him, so they didn't shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">But finally the stupid idiots...uh...came running and...uh...pulled us apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I am talking about the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">They pulled us apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">When they pulled us apart, I knew everything 1s lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And...uh...I was mainly concerned for the rest of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And as I was lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , my...uh...my only satisfaction at that point would be that he would not get a chance to torture me and realize that I am alive, that... that I feel that maybe I would say something to him, or plead and...uh...and this thinking followed actually a outcry from a young girl who became my sister-in-law later. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And she cried, she says, "Please somebody help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Maybe...maybe she just fainted." </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Well, when I heard that, I...1t worried me, ‘cause I was trying to play dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Uh...when he heard that, well, if she fainted she's not gonna be alive much longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And at that point...uh...he took a gun and...uh...the position of my body was evidently so that my head was to the side and evidently when he shot me it was from a angle coming here and going out this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So it basically grazed my skin and part of my bone since my head was that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">But...nevertheless, I was bleeding a lot and he thought, well, when you get a shot right in the forehead like that, how can you live? </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So...and I did not move. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Uh...in the meantime, all this took a long time and it was in afternoon, September, and it was getting darker and it evidently spoiled his...uh...timing because...uh... uh...they turned on the search light already, and on top of everything else they were bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian planes</span> were started flying over the <span class="REGION">area</span> and there was bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">They did not hit us, but they were evidently bombing the <span class="REGION">area</span> that I mention to you later about the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> being bombed and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Well, they quickly turned off the search light and (cough) they...uh...uh...chased everybody in to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , together with the other ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Now I was dead on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , so I had to remain there. (</span><span class="sentence" id="415">Cough) I am sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Well, I immediately realized that I wasn't hurt badly, that I was not near anything similar to being...uh...dead or anything like like that and since I realized that there were <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and I didn't even know exactly because I had to keep my eyes closed not to give myself away, so I...uh...didn't know what they did with the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I thought, "Well, all is lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">They must have taken them to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="419">This was my impression, that they were taking them straight to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Uh...but I saw later on when...when it was completely dark and the search lights came back on, a German...they sent out a German, the same one. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I mean the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> ...uh...to make sure I was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And I was still in the same position. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Uh...And he came to me and he wanted to play smarty. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">He wanted to see if I have pulse. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">To this day a doctor has difficulties finding pulse, so he didn't find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">But then he...he did another trick. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">He picked my arm up and then all of a sudden I felt a release, so I dropped it like it was a piece of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">He shouldn't realize that I was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Then he started searching me here for money and valuables. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Well, I could not help it. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I could not move because that would be the end of me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Well, whatever he found he did, but he did not take my photographs.

(</span><span class="sentence" id="460">ph)]" And he says if I am..., "If she doesn't come out, I will start with her relatives and I'll shoot you all." </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And I heard it, so I said to myself, well, I will not allow it. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I am ready to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And I really was. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">My life at that time did not mean anything, and I wasn't even scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">So, but he didn't shoot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">He grabbed me by hand and he pulled me out of the lager behind the wire ...uh...the <span class="DLF">wired gate</span> , and he took me into a...uh...<span class="INT_SPACE">storage room</span> where they had...uh...coal and wood work, wood for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> , not for us, but for the Germans that were overseeing the...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And he left me over there and locked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Well, the reason he didn't shoot me, because evidently the...uh...man who is in charge of all the operation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik-Starachowice</span> .... His name was Baumgarten. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">It is B- A-U-M-G-A-R-T-E-N, Baumgarten. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">It would be "Baumgarden" in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Uh...well, since they reported to...to him what had happened that night before... uh...then he was afraid to.... He was going to shoot us and say, "Well, I did it and that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">What you gonna do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="473">But now that the Baumgarten found out about it and that was not his plan because his plan was to ship everybody to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Then, of course, he would be shot, would be punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So, an hour later Schrot came into...1 mean Baumgarten came into the...uh...<span class="INT_SPACE">storage room</span> and he looks at me and I am bleeding in the front of my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And I...I was also bleeding in the back because before they shot me, they hit me with the back of the rifle, so there was a <span class="DLF">hole</span> and it was bleeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Well, this Baumgarten looks at me and he says to me...he says, "Tell me what happened?" </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Well, what I told him was not what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I said, "I was standing in a row," which was true, "and when he said he was going to shot us all, I was going to go over and plead with him he should not shoot us." </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Well, that part is not true because I wasn't going to plead with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And I said, "He shot me and...and I fell and I don't remember anything." </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And I remembered every moment and I do remember every feeling and every moment of that situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And then he looks in the front and he looks in the back and he says to me...uh...""Well, what do you have in the back?" </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I says, "Well, I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I fell and I must have fallen unconscious and I don't know what happened afterward." </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Well, I knew but I didn't want to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And...uh...in the meantime, since my husband was among the people and since, like I mentioned, he evidently had money saved and in this particular case, he had a small diamond ring, so he give it to this Baumgarten. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Well, Baumgarten took me out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">storage area</span> , took me to the so-called "<span class="BUILDING">Revier</span> ."

That's why I am mentioning it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">QUESTION:  Do you know the name of the man and the book?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">ANSWER:  He was Moshe Praguer. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">You heard most probably of him, but unfortunately he died before I got to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I was in...1n <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and I tried to get in touch with him and I did not get in touch with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Uh...Anyhow...uh...that afternoon, they put us all on...on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Men separately. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Women separately. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">There is one scene that I must say because it stays with me forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">It is the moment where my father, my mother, my brother and I were standing together and nobody said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I was the only one that said something. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I said, "Daddy, I think this is the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I don't think we will see each other again." </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I don't know why I said it. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">It was like a premonition. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And...uh...when I said that, my father did not answer, but what he...the way he looked at me, I could translate it in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I could translate it that he would say, "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I know the Germans." </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Uh...'cause he knew them as being decent, intelligent, educated and kind people. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So he couldn't understand what had happened to them in the meantime. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So he was actually telling me in one way not to worry, but in the other way, I could sense that he believed me, that he finally believed me because all this time through the war, he was telling me not to worry, that they would not harm us because of the...of the experiences that he had with him while he was living in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Well, they put us separate and, unfortunately, I never saw my father and brother anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I was with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Uh...Well, actually it is not exactly true, because the next day because of the bombing by the Russians, the tracks were...uh...out of order and they could not take us and they...they didn't want to keep us for some reason in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So they let us go out and that was...that one more time that I was able to see my parents and my brother, but after the fixed the tracks, they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And it was a horrifying, indescribable, terrible journey to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="526">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> were closed, only with small little, you know, like cracks opened for <span class="DLF">air</span> which for 2 or 3 hundred people in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> was not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">There was only the food that we were able to take with us, what we had, and we didn't have very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">We couldn't take most of our belongings cause there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">There was...uh...one bucket that was being used...uh...as a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">commode</span> for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">There was one bucket of water to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">I never saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I never... never saw one or the other because it was impossible to push yourself through because we were standing like, you know, one person next to the other and evidently, in a case like that, it was already...people were already so terribly conditioned where nothing mattered, only themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">So you couldn't even come close to any of the objects. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And we traveled like that half way. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">All the way...all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and...uh...we....uh...got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> the usual way as everybody is explaining. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And when I was visiting <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> about two years ago, the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> are the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ...uh...that we had to...uh...cross was the same... uh...the...there were...the big <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> 1s not there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">But they had...uh...small...small <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> which were for individual bodies and they basically looked.... Of course, I am sure you saw the pictures...like ovens.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">QUESTION:  Let's...let's not deal with what is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Let's take it back then. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">QUESTION:  What did you see at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">ANSWER:  What did I see when I got there? </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I had no idea it was...uh...going to be <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> because we didn't see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">On the way to...uh...
QUESTION:  When you arrived! </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Physically when you arrived, what did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Let's do it that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">ANSWER:  When we arrived, they took us off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">They separated us again. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Women separately. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Men separately. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And they told us to go into a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where they say...said it was going to be a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">We were allowed to take soap with us...uh..maybe a comb and a tooth brush and maybe those are the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I cannot recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I cannot be sure of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And...so we took... and we were allowed to take our shoes, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Uh...And... uh...many people, since we were allowed to take soap and many people already had their soap, they pushed gold pieces, American gold pieces, into this soap and...uh...they saved them. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Uh...One lady whom I know and I meet quite often. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">She lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I just saw her recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">She can never forget the fact that I have saved two...uh...gold pieces in...in the soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I risked my life but I...I had no understanding of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I did 1t for her because she asked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And I used the soap for washing and as I washed naturally the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where you stuck the thing kind of got glued back and then when we got to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ...uh...I give it to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Uh... They...uh...what they did, when we walked out the other way...uh...it was a selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">In other words, not all people survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">They were selecting...uh...one left, one right. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">There was...the guy that was doing the selection was Eichmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">He had a...uh...he had helpers. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Of course, the Ukrainians and there were two girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">I don't remember the other one, but one girl she was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">When I got out from there, he was standing right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">We were naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Can you imagine how a person feels, especially a woman, in front...no matter how...how bad the situation 1s, whatever...I mean we practically lost our minds at...at moments like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">But still the fact that we were naked in front of a man whoever it may have been, it was devastating and especially for a teenager that is modest. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And when I saw that I...I was confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">He was standing there with a...with a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">He had this horse whip which was thick and, you know, all leather to the end, very thin at the end, and he was going left, right, left, right, left, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Well, I...I don't know...I cannot say that I was brave. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Maybe I was just not experienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And I simply went to him because when I saw that he took my mother on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , I started begging him. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I says, "Please" I says, "This is the only person left in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I haven't got anybody anymore." </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I says, "Please. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Put me together with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">We will work harder together. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">We will be more loyal and whatever." </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Well, he put me together with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">That means going to...to the concen...to the...to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Well, the girl somehow took pity on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I don't...with this girl I had several other incidences too because I must say that as bad as they were and I wouldn't want to say anything special for the Germans as a whole, but I...I must say that on occasions, you found a person with feelings and compassion and they did special things. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Maybe it was not a great effort to them, but was a lifesaving to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Well, this girl was about my age and...and I went to her and at that point I looked already like a balloon because he used the pa...the....uh...whip on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And not on my body, but the upper body, on my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">My eyes were swollen. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I had little slits here that I could only see, but I was so desperate that I talked and I...1n German I said to her, I says, "You are the same age as I am and I am sure and I hope that your parents are at least safe somewhere or you would want to know that they are safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And if anything like that happened to you, wouldn't you want to save your mother?" </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And that's all I said to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And she took my mother and I and she smuggled us to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">We survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">They took us to...uh ...to <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and the next morning--or was it the same day actually, because time had no...no value whatsoever--and this is where they...they put our...uh...marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">It was A here. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">That meant transport A, and then the number is 14028. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">That was my number. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I went first for them to do it because I wanted to see how it felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I was worrying that mother would not be able to stand it or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">So it...1t worried me. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I went first and mother was...mother's number was the following number A-14029. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And we were given numbers and we stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">So we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">The first day before they put us into our regular <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , they put us... they put us into a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> which was called <span class="BUILDING">Death Barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Uh...they are standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> are preserved, and they are standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">They put us over there temporarily, but usually when you put people there that means they were going to...to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But they had transport coming one after the other, one after the other, and they had no time to kill everybody like that because the procedure, no matter how fast they have developed it to be, ...uh...did not work as fast as they would want it to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">So, we were in that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I saw it...uh ...recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">It had a <span class="DLF">court yard</span> , also surrounded with bricks. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">At the end of the <span class="DLF">court yard</span> on the <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> , there was a big plate, steel plate attached to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Against this, I was told that--when I was there a year and a half ago, about two years ago--I was told that this what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I had no idea that they were doing it while I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but that steel block was there because they were shooting people, putting them against the <span class="DLF">steel block</span> and shooting them. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">That way the <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> would not fall apart and I realized that the whole <span class="DLF">yard</span> was drenched with blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And we looked at it and feelings come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Expression was motionless, but the feelings were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And I looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Then I went to...they have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they have so-called archives...uh...and stuff that were of some importance, like letters or writings or pictures or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Well, the pictures that I mentioned earlier in my journey to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wierzbnik</span> after I was shot that I saved them, I still had them because I was able to save them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">QUESTION:  How?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Well that was not after the...the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">That was still before the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">I had them. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So as we were going into the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> I was afraid that those pictures were going to be taken from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And for some reason I had an idea if we are going in we will have to come out, so maybe I will find the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">But that was not the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">We went in and then we did <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">We went out the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">That's where Eichmann was making a selection and the ones to go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> were on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="645">The ones, and myself and my mother on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> after the girl saved us, were on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">They put us 1n the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and I realized that I could not find the pictures anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">They were picking them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">They knew that we were going to do that...that people were going to throw money away, their jewelry away and, you know, important possessions (cough). </span><span class="sentence" id="649">So after...after they took us the other way out, they had a group of Germans or maybe...uh ... Jewish people that were supposed to... They were walking with...uh...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and picking up all the things and that's why I mentioned the <span class="INT_SPACE">archive room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I had hopes that I would be able to find pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">If not necessarily the pictures that I had with me, but the pictures...uh...maybe pictures of relatives, maybe pictures of friends and so on, and I spent quite a long time in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">They were very cooperative. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Now I am speaking of the time three years ago when I went to Au...
QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">You're jumping time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">ANSWER:  Well, I am...I am sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">QUESTION:  Let me if I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">You've jump time and we are at the moment running out of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So what I need to know very simply is when you returned two years later, did you find the photos?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">That's all I need to know at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I still am hoping to find them, because I didn't have enough time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I need to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I really can't go into this. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I need to focus solely on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">You have come out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I need to know about..

<p><span class="sentence" id="675">ANSWER:  Yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Well, we were in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And...uh...life was suddenly entirely different. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">We were sleeping with 9 or 10 people in one...uh...what do you call it?...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">We had one thin blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Uh...We were sleeping on the straw and...uh ...we were given food once a day...uh...small little piece of bread...uh...and...uh...some kind of brew that they called coffee had no similarity in smell and taste or anything to coffee, but at least it was something to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And...uh ... uh...Life became very bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="682">QUESTION:  Did you work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">ANSWER:  Uh...There was...uh...in the beginning, there was no work. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Uh...And even though there was any work it had no meaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">It just had the meaning of the work was to destroy us, to make us tired, to make us exhausted because in the beginning like, for example, every morning we had to be waken up at 4 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">They used...they called it "Appell"...uh...roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">Uh...We had to get out, rain or shine, frost or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">We had to stand for hours, hours until they decided to bring the breakfast which consisted of this horrible brew--tasted like witches brew--that we drank in the morning, but by the time it got to us it wasn't even hot, but it was warm and it still was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And...uh...Then they would organize what they called...uh...uh...like... uh...groups they had a special name for it in German but it escape me. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Groups of people that were doing different things under supervision of a German with a gun or several Germans with a gun and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">So I was assigned to a group that was supposed to be carrying stones from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">Then the next day from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> back to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and just keep us moving, ...uh...making us exhausted and tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">People were dying on the job because of malnutrition and loss of strength and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And dehydration; and basically every day, we were losing a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So that was easy for them without shoting, shooting...uh... uh... firing a bullet and using a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And...uh...later on I was put into a so-called <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where all the clothing particles and so on which were not...uh...going to be reusable for the Germans, because the Germans were fixing and cleaning and washing the garments that they were confiscating from us to send it to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because they had a shortage of goods and ...and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">So anything that was usable they were sending to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> back, but the things that were not usable were given...put in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , maybe the size of this one or larger, and we were tearing the pieces and putting them together and braiding them into a large braids out of different materials and those braids later on, they were endless. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Those braids later they were folding into a disk. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">In other word, the braid would be...this way they were rolling the braids and making them into discs. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I don't know what those discs were...uh...for. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Some said that they were being put between ammunition to...to keep them from rubbing together that that was insolation or whatever it is between whatever.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="703">ANSWER:  Well, we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">ANSWER:  1942, 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  When...When did you...when did they prepare you to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">ANSWER:  Well, they were...uh...they were preparing us to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> at the time where it was bad already, that they saw the war was being lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">We heard of the attempt to assassinate Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">We heard of many other things and that's when they, instead of running themselves, they had to take us because they did not want to leave any evidence, especially evidence that can talk...uh...and remember, behind them. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So naturally they took us all. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Uh...So what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> that day...uh...uh...they poisoned most of the bread and suddenly bread became plentiful in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">They put poison. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Uh...the sick ones could not...uh...leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> so they were shot; or the ones that looked like dead were left. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Some that were able to...to eat, died of poisoning from the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Uh...We walked out and we were chased out and we were not...we didn't have enough time to get the bread so we didn't have it, which was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Uh...We thought it was bad, but it saved our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Everybody had a little something, and we...uh...started wal...walking out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> cause they... everything went so fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">They did not have transportation for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Transportation...uh...which I learned was a private concern that...uh...the Germans who were working 1n...uh... destroying us had to pay for the transportation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">QUESTION:  What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Don't you worry about what you learned later. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I would like to know...
ANSWER:  But I must say why...
QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">ANSWER:  I lost my trend now. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">So they did not have because they were not able to pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Usually they took from us whatever they ...we had left everything behind us...to pay for...uh...to the company that was in charge of transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">So...And it was bombed, and transportation was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So we were walking a <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="729">It was...uh... January already, first part of January. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And we were walking and the snow was high and, of course, by us walking...crowds like I would say 30 or 40 people in one row, the snow was pushed to the side and...and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">On the sides of the <span class="DLF">streets</span> we saw bodies of men who were evidently taking the same <span class="DLF">road</span> before us. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">They were chased out before us and many of them, a lot of them did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And we saw a leg or a hand or a nose sticking out from the...from the snow and we realized that this is what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">So it made our journey that much worse because we wanted to see when we saw somebody if it was not anybody, my father, my brother or somebody else, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">So...uh...And it was a long, long journey to such extent that I remember we couldn't even walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">You know when you walk a long time something happens to you at the hips. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">It...1t just doesn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">So we were walking like sideways, the moving our legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">You know, like sliding our legs sideways. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Uh...then we came somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">We were passing...uh...some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and some small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="742">They were deserted. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">We could see...uh...smoke coming out of <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">We could see lights in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and everything, but not a soul would come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">So we were walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Some people were making attempts to escape like jumping into a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> or...or something similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Some succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Some did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Since I mentioned that things were bad for the German army, and it seemed like they were losing the war and it was like toward the end, so at that time some Germans...civilians might have been a little kinder and maybe they helped some because of the fright of what may happen to them for what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Uh...Finally, we came to a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> where they had a <span class="DLF">platform</span> ...platforms where they put us on <span class="DLF">platforms</span> , and part of the time we rode on open <span class="DLF">platform</span> and it was snowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">It was my birthday, 22nd of January. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And we looked like snowmen covering up with snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And we were just sitting curled up over there and going to a unknown and worse...
QUESTION:  Where did you end up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">ANSWER:  We ended up... At the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> could not take us any further and they took us to a <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> where they had many animals and evidently somebody took pity and they didn't leave us <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and they chased us 1n with the animals, with the cows, with the horses, with the pigs, with the this, and you know, we were scared to death, but it was either that or try to freeze to death <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And we stayed there...there overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Evidently something was not clear <span class="NPIP">outside</span> that we could not continue or maybe the Germans that were taking care of us needed the rest and then and therefore we stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">The next day we starting going again, walking again until we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Here we need to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Uh...Bonnie put on the short tape please. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Let's cut this tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">That's the end of this tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">We have a very short...

QUESTION:  We are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrtick</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="764">ANSWER:  Yes, they brought us into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> and...uh...they did not have <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> for us immediately so they put us along a <span class="DLF">road</span> within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">It was...the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , a big <span class="DLF">fence</span> was on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and here around that <span class="REGION">area</span> it looked like in the olden days they had <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">They had, you know, like a [hip (ph)] up here and a <span class="DLF">door</span> to go into a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And we did...we had no idea what the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> was... were...uh...but since they did not have the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> for us, they put us in this open <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">It was January already, 23rd or 24th and so...uh...snow was high and the snow was already hard, and it was like <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ice mountain</span> and...uh...we had to wait there. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And...uh...my mother was worn out and very tired and she just simply just lied down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and fell asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And, of course, I understood it was bad for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I kept on waking her up and trying to get her up but it was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And, of course, she evidently caught pneumonia or something like and that was the beginning of her illness during the time in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Well, about...uh...night time they found a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us, and they pushed a great number of people into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">We were glad to be in there, although we couldn't move and we couldn't sit anywhere or...or so on because it was not prepared for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So at least we were not freezing. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">So we stayed there until next morning and, of course, I remember a incident where people were just losing their mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Exactly losing...just going berserk and fighting and screaming and killing each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Uh...I mean I don't know how they could, but I mean their strength was unbelievable when you get in a state like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Uh...well in the morning they separated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Of course, I have no idea how many dead...uh... remained behind us and so on and they put us into <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">We were in a <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and Mother was not doing well at all anymore and she could not...one day...I mean she was forced to leave her...uh...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> for the roll count. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Uh... the reason I am stuttering about it 1s because I am used to saying it in German and therefore, I mean, to translate it is English is kind of awkward. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Awkward. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I mean I have to find the right name for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">QUESTION:  The "Appell" is fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">ANSWER:  So...uh... Uh...anyhow so Mother came one...one day she was evidently at the end of her strength and...uh...we went to the roll call and my girlfriend and I were holding her because she couldn't stand up and...uh...we felt that she...uh...became completely limp. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">You know, that her legs were not holding her anymore, that they were like detached and we were holding her up and then comes this situation again with this woman that saved me once from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eichmann</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And she saw this and she came over and, of course, I still did not have confidence in her because I had no idea that she was going to be kind to me through several ordeals, but she was and she says...she asks what the problem was. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And I told her, I said, "I believe Mother is sick and I would like to take her to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="790">She says, "Go ahead and take her." </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Well, I was young, still strong girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Believe it! </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I picked my Mother up in my arms like a baby and I walked with her into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and I sat in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and I was just holding her, you know, like a baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And she evidently had a stroke because I know that she could see me with one eye and I could tell that the way she...her eye was moving that she understood and I was holding her and kissing her like a baby and sitting there...sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">There was nothing else I could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Until the roll call was over and everybody...uh...came into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">By then, the girl came...the German woman came to me again and she says, "Well, if she is sick, you have to take her to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> I mentioned before was called "Revier." </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Uh...So I couldn't carry her by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">My girlfriend and I were holding her and kind a dragging her to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and we put her on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and...uh...left her there. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I...that was still morning...uh...in the afternoon when they were bringing soup, I did not want to eat the soup, but I wanted to take it for Mother and, of course, they would not give me a extra dish for Mother because they said she was going to be taken care of in the <span class="BUILDING">Revier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Uh...but I didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">When I came to the <span class="BUILDING">Revier</span> with the little pot as big as this cup or smaller and I was approaching the...uh...bunk area where Mother was lying down, a girl stopped me and she said to me, "Your mother is dead." </span><span class="sentence" id="803">At that time, I don't really remember what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I know that the food spilled and I fell to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> ; I evidently fainted. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I don't know how long I was there, but I was still there when I came to; and when I came to...I will tell you something, you most probably won't believe it, because I don't believe it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I don't believe it, ‘cause I was so calm. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I was just like a...like a puppet doing things and the first things were I took all her belongings, her shoes, her little scarf, her garter belt, her comb and whatever else she had there, and...uh...still I knew that this was not enough of her that I wanted to take with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And I asked for scissors and I cut a great part of her hair and--and I did it, amazingly, only from the left side because I said, "It is from the heart side"--and I cut her hair, and I still have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And those were the things that...that I did like...like automat...like a puppet...like... there was nothing life in me at all that...that prompted me to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I...I don't know I maybe...maybe one corner of my brain was directing me to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Other than that, I just cannot understand anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And then I...uh...went with these things to my <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and usually when you have anything that belongs to you, you carry it with you everywhere you go because if you leave it for a minute, it goes, disappears. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">So whatever bundle you had with you, you had to even take to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">You had to sleep with your head on it and your hand attached to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Well, I took the bundle and ...uh...the same evening [...uh...began reacting a little bit more normal and I felt like I was thawing out from a deep freeze and I...uh...somewhat was able to go to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> which was near by us and I wanted to see my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">So I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">Of course, I would never do it again if I had to do it over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">I went and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> was empty already. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">They had completely undressed her and they had...uh... dropped her in the <span class="INT_SPACE">wash room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="820">There was one <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> where they were dropping all the dead, you know, just like a pile of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">So I went in the <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> and I saw my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">I touched her. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And I left. (</span><span class="sentence" id="825">sobbing) The next day I still was not satisfied because I knew that..uh...every morning they were taking all the dead and taking them either to the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> or they were dumping them in <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and burning them. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And they...every...1t was like a custom. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Every morning there was a guy that came with a wooden little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and he was pulling it and he was stopping to all the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and all the Reviers and pulling out all the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">So I knew that this was going to happen and I knew it was happening around such-a-such hour, so my girl friend and I... I... begged her...I..."Please my dear. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I must see Mother once again." </span><span class="sentence" id="831">So, we went and sure enough he went by with about 10 or 12 corpses, and the reason I could recognize my mother because majority of people that entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and later on...uh...Ravensbriick, had no hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Their hair were chopped off because they were using the hair for doing...uh...making <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> or doing other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">I mean they found use for every...everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">So I could tell my Mother because she has such pretty brown hair and they were hanging (crying) so I saw her. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">But my pain was so terrible that I pushed a...I still have a mark on one of my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I think it was this hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">It still has a mark where I pushed the whole hand in my mouth to avoid screaming because if I screamed, maybe they would shoot me or something, you know, cause there were Germans all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">So...uh...I could...couldn't pull out my fist for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">My...my friend had to help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And that was the last I saw of my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And, of course,...uh...we stayed there for a little while and we were taken to work...uh... I would not be able to explain what I was doing because it was terrifying, horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">It was like a tremendous <span class="DLF">ditch</span> about three times the size of this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , dug. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">In...1n the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> they had human...human waste. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Not bodies...not bodies, but human waste. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And...uh...the waste was fermenting. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">I...they evidently, they used it for...uh...for fertilizer or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">That was my understanding at...at that time although at first it looked liked the worst...uh... fantasy, the worst and the most horrible fantastic story and we had to....
