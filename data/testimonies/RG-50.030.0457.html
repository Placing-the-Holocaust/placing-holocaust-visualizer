<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  You were told why you were being sent there?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  The people that I remember were mainly in that class, they were all girls, because it was -- I guess it was all girl’s classes, boys must have been in a different class, and if I had that picture that I have of -- several picture -- I’d -- I don’t think they’re here, I think I have them at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I can name those girls quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And what -- what did you ask me, about --
QUESTION:  Just wondering if there were any other friend-friendships that you remember from this time frame, of being around seven year old, you know, seven, eight, nine years old in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , or maybe you already covered that before, when I asked about friends before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  Well, you know, I gave the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> my autograph album, and in there you can see what they wrote, you know, and in those days it was not done like here, it was really something. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">When you gave somebody an autograph album, they took it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they wrote very carefully, they drew little pictures, or -- or put on decals, and as you can see, it’s really quite interesting, and they didn’t take it lightly, not scribbled in, as you can see the contrast, you’ ll see fa -- I have some from <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and you just scribbled whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I wish you -- I wish you luck, I wish you that, da-da da-da, and one 15, and just went on, you know, from <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> to <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">No gus -- A-And you could -- Some of them sort of wished me well, and when you read the poems in German, you realize that they were -- it was sort of like the end of something, like they were -- we were going to part, you say, well, we’re just little girls, it wasn’t like we were going on to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">It was like as if we were going to part.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  Again, an interesting question. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I really don’t remember, yi -- they were, again, not the kind of parents that would discuss anything with me, and I just -- and I never really questioned it, even in my -- until my young adulthood. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">You know, they were what they were, and I had to do what they said, and I was not -- my opinion was not considered, or -- it was like a fait accompli. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And, but I think by the time I went where my mother send me, to that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that seems so blurry in my mind, with these other girls who lived there, I know somebody a -- I guess she was unraveling her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> situation, or selling <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , or -- I don’t know what she was doing while I was away in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">That’s when I realized -- and also at -- at the same time, I was recovering from that appendix surgery, which was quite something the way they -- old-fashioned way that they did it in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">That’s when I realized that things were really changing, that’s what I seem to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And then she came and got me, but I don’t remember any real discussions that we were -- nor did -- let me say at this point, that they never expected to go anywhere but to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">That was the end of the journey, hopefully that we were going to get there, cause that’s where my father was, they had no intention of going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , or anywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">That seemed far away enough, which sounds crazy today, but not then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  I’m wondering as you grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , did you ever get in trouble with your parents?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  Did you ever ask your mother or father for a sibling?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">But my mother always told me, I don’t know if she told me this then -- no, probably not, I was too young, but later, that, she said, “Well, in Hitler time this is -- it was fashionable, everybody -- everybody just had one child, cause you never knew what was going to happen.” </span><span class="sentence" id="337">That’s wh -- I guess she told me that later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And then I found out much later on, which made me very angry, that she’d had an abortion after me, and she knew it was a -- a male child, and -- but by that time, I didn’t care, you know, any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Maybe I was married by then, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">But she always used to tell me -- and indeed, a lot of the kids that I knew, they were single ch-children. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Not all, but a lot.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="383">QUESTION:  Did you have any favorite hobbies or activities as a child in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  Well, I loved going to the movies, which of course wasn’t very often, but love it, I love it to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And I was absolutely crazy about Shirley Temple. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">She seemed to personify everything glamorous, and -- you know, the way people felt about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and Hollywood, and I had, not a Shirley Temple doll, but I got those -- I guess they were all made for -- for export, like a paper dolls, and then you cut them out, and put the clothes on -- on the -- and I played with it for hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And then of course, what I had, the way ba -- the way kids here have baseball cards, this was my prize possession, they were actual black and white photographs of Shirley Temple in these different movies that she was in, which came in sets like baseball cards, and I bought them, and I have a -- and I had a photograph album of her, and also I collected another -- it was a young Austrian movie star, her name was Trowdel Stark. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And I have this album, I took it with me, I have it to this day, and I probably -- probably nobody else would have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I should write Shirley Temple Black and tell her about her album. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And once in awhile, when I see these movies on TV, for instance when she’s wearing a -- when she was seven or eight, whatever, and wearing a satin pajama with appliqued bunnies on it, and I’ll look at her in this scene, I say, “Oh, my God, I’ve seen this picture, this photograph of her in that particular outfit so many times, leafing through my album. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And you’re not getting that album.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  Well, I -- I really, you know, it’s -- I’m sort of embarrassed to talk about it, because it isn’t very nice, but it’s the truth, it’s the way mo -- many Germans felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I know I have this feeling, from my father especially, that he -- you could almost say it’s almost like an anti-Semitic feeling about Jews from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , you know, with payess, and with, you know, that kind of clothing, and all the other accoutrements, I had that feeling, carrying it over to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , that he felt like he was a different kind of Jew, very secular. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And didn’t really -- And s-spoke no Yiddish, I don’t think they were brought up with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We ate -- my mother’s cooking was not particularly wonderful, not everybody’s mother is a good cook, or a great housekeeper. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">But when we came here, and I learned, you know, about all these Jewish dishes, I was not used to them because I never grew -- I never grew up with them -- with these things from <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> like latkas and chopped liver and kasha varnishkas, and -- and -- or anything that was -- you know, that people make, that when they’re kosher, it was very strange to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And so I would say that that -- maybe that’s also why I don’t remember any -- I don’t remember any seders, per se, in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">When we went to <span class="BUILDING">seders</span> , they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , in the early days, people that they met. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Now, we were refugees, and we were at other <span class="BUILDING">people’s houses</span> , but it’s not something that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And yet, we did go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I -- It’s not clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I think that’s something I would remember.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER:  He -- He could no longer run his business, you know, it -- he was self-employed, and I remember something about his breaking up with his partner, maybe the partner was leaving, or maybe he s -- was still able to buy him out, or sell it, or leave it. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">It’s not clear, but I know that he had to leave that business, and I don’t know if, in 1938, he c -- he could sell the business for any kind of -- you know, that had any value, or he just had to walk away from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">This, again, was not something that they told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And same with the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , you know, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">No one ever came to look at it, or to rent it, or you know, and that we would leave the way you would normally do now, if -- it wasn’t that kind of leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I think we just left it, that’s what people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And my mother had a nervous breakdown over her new dining room set, I remember that she did not want to leave her <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> set behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">We just took some things, you know, that were -- that seemed -- that’s how I ended up with these pictures that I have in my autograph album, and my Shirley Temple album, cause those little things were important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But, we did not move with -- with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , no.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="450">QUESTION:  So, when did you leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> for the outskirts, where you were staying in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="451">When was that, and how long do you think you were there? </span><span class="sentence" id="452">What -- What are the memories that you have of being there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  I remember being there, I would say about a month, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And also I remember that that appendix surgery was -- it was not a good time, it was er -- already dangerous for me to ha -- you know, have a doctor operate on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">My mother was not happy with this whole thing, and I would say it all must have been at the beginning of 1938, somewhere between the beginning of 1938, and then April, I think we left in April of 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Can really tell -- I have given you -- I just thought of it, pictures I -- I -- actually, you have the actual passports, and you could check in the passport when that really was, if my memory 1s incorrect by the dates that they put in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And of course that was the other thing about the passports, that we had a s -- a statenloss passports, stateless, no more German. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So there was another thing, I do remember my mother telling me, and I also have my own passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">One day I will find it in my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and when I do, I will give it to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , but I’ve looked high and low, I can’t find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">But you have several, you have my father’s and one with a German passport, and one with the stateless. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And I think my mother’s as well, if I’m not mistaken.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  Nothing really, that we were going on this -- we’re going to meet him in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and I have a feeling like it was going to be, once we got there, like it was going to be pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We were going to a <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> that was ou -- on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tre-Treverningen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">That’s how the Dutch pronounce it, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And it was a -- a <span class="BUILDING">beach resort</span> that was sort of -- Treverningen to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , is like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlantic City</span> is to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">You know, nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And it had a <span class="DLF">pier</span> , like an <span class="DLF">amusement pier</span> , and a big <span class="DLF">beach</span> , and we were living in a boarding -- we’re going to -- well, that’s when I got there, but the trip going, was -- was dangerous, that I do remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Do you want me to tell you about that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="473">ANSWER:  That was -- wi -- yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I met up with my mother for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I guess I -- she took me back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , or you know, we left, you know, by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and I guess we didn’t have very much with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">What could it have been? </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I mean, suitcases, can’t carry more. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And we’re in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and she was very nervous about the <span class="DLF">border</span> , and she told me not to talk, not to say anything, bec -- cause you know how they come in at a <span class="DLF">border</span> , first you -- the Germans come in, and then the other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , in this case it was Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And we were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bedtime</span> first, and these people sort of hid us. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">We were there one or two nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> , and we stayed 1n -- in an <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , and we did not come down for meals or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">They were very nice, I guess it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they -- they hid us, even in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And then -- I don’t know quite why -- why we couldn’t go directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , but we didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And then we made a connecting <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> on another day, and that’s when these -- these German Nazis came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">There was a conductor, German, you know, regular conductor, but then the Nazis came in, looking at your passport, or officers of some sort, and my mother said, “Don’t say anything.” </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And I, of course -- she se -- he said, “How old are you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And I said, “I’m -- I’m -- I’m 10, but my mother said I should say I’m nine,” or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And my mother thought she would die, she was ready to kill me, cause any discrepancy could, you know, if -- I don’t know why I did that, or -- it was one way or the other, but it -- they let it slide, but I remember that, and I remember how I felt <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , that I knew I made a big mistake, but that’s kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And then we did get there, and then my father met us. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Where we were, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Maybe went directly to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , to -- or maybe it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , and then got to it -- but we stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> until -- through the summer -- spring and summer of 1938, til we left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and --
QUESTION:  The <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> was in this <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">It was like 1-in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you know in a -- a <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">The reason I say <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> is what I remember is that we had these communal meals, and as a matter o -- there was an actor at -- there, at that <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> , at -- I didn’t know it then, but I since then saw him the -- he was in many, many American musicals. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">His name was S.Z. Sakall, S-a-k-a-l-l, or something, and he was called Cuddles in a lot of movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">He was in movies, you know, in musicals with Betty Grable, and Don Ameche and played a -- the roly-poly, good-natured funny role in lots of movies, but he was emigrating, and we had these communal meals, you know, like in a <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> , which I’ve never had before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">QUESTION:  Did you get the impression that other people there besides him were also planning to leave, planning to emigrate from there? </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Was this a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for people to gather who were trying to emigrate?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  I didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I didn’t really know what we were doing, again the secretiveness, the secrecy, I should say, until -- oh, I must say an asi -- a footnote, I saw -- everybody has <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , you know, and we saw the queen, Queen Wilhelmina and her daughter, riding around on her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and -- very, very casual, not like <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="501">One day, my father said that he was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , to see if he’d get tickets to come to -- to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , that he -- and the reason, I guess by that time they told me that much, that he could not -- he was under the impression that he could work there, or start a business, or something, but he could not. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">It wasn’t permitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So, it would have been just a question of time until his money would run out, so he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , he said he was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> to see if we get tickets to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , that’s how it seemed. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And if we could, we would, and if not, not. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">It seemed so casual, like if we can get theater tickets we’d go, and if we can’t, we can’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And he came back a day or two later, and he had tickets to -- on -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> called the Startendam, and we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And when I’d ask him about this, you know, years later my daughters would always urge me, “Talk to Papa, talk to Papa. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Ask him how this happened.” </span><span class="sentence" id="509">But he never wanted to talk about it, you know, he’d always say, “Ach,” you know, “stop, I don’t want to,” -- you know, he’d gesture with his hand, and he al -- he’d say, “Ach, you think it was easy? </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Ah, it wasn’t easy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="511">So I presume what he meant by that was bribes. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">What else could it have been, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="513">But he must have had the foresight to have money or whatever, cause that’s the only way you got anywhere in those days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="514">QUESTION:  Was there any problem with you having the stateless passports, you and your parents, at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">ANSWER:  No, I guess they were good for something, in -- at that time, y-you have to remember, it changed like monthly, or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">You know, there were always new -- I’m sure they would have been worthless. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I -- I mean in -- that was September. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">We arrived here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , in September- on September 18", 1938, and the Crystal Night was not even two months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So, the timing was very, very fortuitous. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And we were hearing things, we were hearing things, you know, reading things about, I guess the -- I -- I -- I -- well, not the anschluss, but Hitler going into the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , or maybe it was right after, because my father, very soon after we got here, the first thing that he did was to get -- send tickets to my Uncle Martin, and his wife and my cousin Ilsa, the ones in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , for him to ge -- to -- to emigrate to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">For some reason or other, that was easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Couldn’t get her to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but that was possible, but they didn’t use them, they didn’t use them. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And I have found out since, here at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , that unfortunately they were all killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , the three of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I sa -- I looked it up, and it was very -- it was very sad, and to -- to actually see it, you know, on paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I never knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="526">QUESTION:  What was the trip like to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  The trip, the way I remember it, was quite pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I mean, it was a -- I guess a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch ship</span> , and it was, you know, just on the cusp of something, they were -- it was a real -- it was a -- it -- it was like going on shi -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">It was not a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refugee ship</span> , we were going second class, which I realized not long a -- not long ago, when I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> , and I was listening with the headset to Tom Brokaw, I found out why I never went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> , because we were -- I never knew, we just got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> when we got here, and cousins, you know, second cousins, whatever, were waiting for us here. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">But the reason was, if you weren’t in third class, you didn’t have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">That’s what he said, and -- but it was quite pleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I remember meeting this American family, with their children, who had gone to Europe on vacation, cause it was, you know, early September, summer vacation with their children, and they befriended me because the mother, the father, they wanted their children to meet a little -- a real little German girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And I remember they took me into the <span class="INT_SPACE">lounge</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , for a -- in-into the <span class="BUILDING">cocktail lounge</span> in the afternoon, for a drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And this drink turned out to be som -- it was horrible, and it turned out to be Coca-Cola, which was something that I had never -- 1-it’s a very, very strange flavor, if you ’ve never ever had it, and I don’t like it to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">But -- And then I -- My mother bought me -- [ had it til not so long ago, a little sailor doll from that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , with a -- with a little sailor hat, the way they had them, you know, a little white, like a little brechen 1s it? </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And the little black ribbon around it, with the name of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and it was like a little stuffed doll, with velvet, and I lu -- I wanted it desperately, I wanted this doll, and they did get it for me, and I had it for years and years and years, you know, little sailor from -- as a souvenir. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I do not ha -- remember this as an unpleasant sh -- sh -- it wa -- it was like going -- sort of like on some kind of vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I mean, I didn’t know the difference, I’d never been on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> before, maybe it was pretty -- I wouldn’t say primitive, but maybe Spartan, but it -- 1t seemed fine to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">QUESTION:  Did you know that you were moving to another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">ANSWER:  I must have, but I -- it’s -- for some reason, it has like no -- no memory, or no great meaning. [ -- </span><span class="sentence" id="541">| -- ] -- I just -- of course I must have known, I mean, we were going to -- but it had no -- I didn’t know what -- what to expect.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  What do you remember first seeing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  What I -- First seeing, I remember getting -- I don’t really recall s -- being o -- seeing the Statue of Liberty, like in the movies, I guess it’s all mixed up with a million documentaries that I’ve seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">But I do remember the <span class="DLF">pier</span> , getting off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and I guess they did have people coming onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , you know, it wasn’t such -- you didn’t just get off. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">People who -- you know, health examiners, or whatever, you know, and -- were looking at your papers, it’s a whole process, and then eventually getting off on this huge <span class="DLF">pier</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and then getting into these relatives’ <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">These relatives were my mother’s relatives, and -- who were -- the -- the woman was the sister of Arthur Fiedler, the conductor of the Boston Pops, which didn’t mean anything to me at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And I remember get -- driving from the <span class="DLF">pier</span> to this -- wherever we stayed in that first <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that they rented for us -- probably did, and I said something ab -- you know, I said, “Oh, these <span class="BUILDING">skyscrapers</span> , they’re not so tall,” or something like that, I said, having expected -- “They don’t seem like anything so big.” </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I remember saying something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">QUESTION:  In German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">ANSWER:  In German, of course, I didn’t speak a word of English, not a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">It was always just done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  Can you tell me the date on which you arrived to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  Yes, that was a day after my birthday, it was September 18", 1938, I do remember that very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  How old did you turn that year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  11 on that day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">QUESTION:  Do you remember your birthday on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">ANSWER:  That must be when I got the sailor doll, I think, as a present. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Yeah, my birthday was always you know, to me, a big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">After all, I was an only child, and children like their birthdays, so I think that probably celebrated it in some manner on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">QUESTION:  What do you remember about starting <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">ANSWER:  Mm, yes, I do remember -- I remember the s -- the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Eventually, after a few years, we moved across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but at -- the first <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was, I remember the address, 650 West 172" Street. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">That was off between <span class="DLF">Broadway</span> and <span class="DLF">Fort Washington Avenue</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">PS 173</span> was on the corner of <span class="DLF">Fort Washington Avenue</span> and <span class="DLF">173" Street</span> , so I just had to walk dow -- you know, two <span class="DLF">blocks</span> , one down and one across. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I remember an interview, vaguely. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">My father taking me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and they telling me, whoever, maybe it was the principal, that -- what grade they were putting me into. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">They put me into four A. In those days the <span class="BUILDING">semesters</span> were split up, A and B, ha-half a year, you know, not like fourth grade, A and B. So it was the beginning of the f-fourth year, four A, which was five sem -- five semesters less than what I should have been in, two and a half years. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And they said that when I would learn English, that it would be sort of automatic that I would catch up with myself, which was not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And I remember feeling very -- feeling very bad about that, you know, w-with -- with these young kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Again, it’s -- it’s a filmy kind of dreamy memory, seeing myself in that class, but I was not happy to be with children that were that much younger, and I didn’t speak any English, and also, I don’t remember other children that I was -- could be friends with, or drawn to, because there were other little German girls or boys in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">class</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">It was just me. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">So I guess they came later, or at other times. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And eventually I did become a very good student, and it was only because of that that I skipped a lot of grades, and I wen -- went to <span class="BUILDING">summer school</span> somewhere in - you know, before finishing <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , that I made up at least a year or two, and then I -- then in <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> , I was put in what they called RA, it was called rapid advance classes, you know, for kids who were doing well, and made it two years out of three, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">But in the end, after <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">graduating high school</span> , I just a pi -- I came out just about right, so if I hadn’t been, I’d be going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> til I was -- the end of my 18" year, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">But <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I remember my f -- early on, I had to -- I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with a poem, which I had to learn by heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And my father, as I told you, was -- didn’t have much patience, and I just couldn’t get it into my head, I couldn’t seem to grasp it, the engli -- an-and he smacked me, you know, for again not getting it right, and it turned out to be “The Star Spangled Banner,” that’s what that poem was. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I didn’t enjoy <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ats -- at first, but the kids were -- I -- I guess they were all -- all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I -- I don’t remember, I don’t remember them being particularly -- I felt isolated, but I don’t remember being, you know, taunted, or -- particularly one way or another, particularly cruel, or -- but isolated. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And early on, going to the -- as a school outing, going to the 1939 World’s Fair, that was very thrilling. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I re -- I remember doing that, and enjoyable. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And I think I only did it once after that, on my own with family or somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">But once I got the language, then -- and also I was becoming a teenager, I became a much happier child, and really sort of found myself, which wasn't easy with my parents and these circumstances, you know, little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I was -- I felt -- I never had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> of my own, I slept in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">My parents never had a <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> again, ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">The other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was -- was had always two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , and it was sort of like a -- with two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couches</span> in it, each -- they slept separately, sort of like a <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> , like you sometimes get in a

<p><span class="sentence" id="739">QUESTION:  And, did you get the sense --

<p><span class="sentence" id="900">ANSWER:  To be honest with you, almost the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I am sure that I will die with that feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Don’t know quite why I feel that way, being that I -- you know, didn’t have to go through a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but I’m very -- just so grateful, you know, that -- and feel so fortunate that I- like, I missed it by a hair, and I just feel a -- a tremendous -- a tremendous feeling of something to all the people that died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">I -- I just -- To me, that’s sort of like my religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">I just feel compelled to read, you know, almost anything on that, or see every film, or every documentary. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I just feel very drawn to it, and I’m always very annoyed with people -- most of them are Jewish, who say -- and there are many, I -- I can’t deal with that, I -- I can’t watch it, I can’t look at it, I can’t read it, and I always feel like, I said, “You can’t look at it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="906">I said, “You di -- it -- it’s like you -- you ought -- you know, you didn’t have to go through it, why can’t you look at it? </span><span class="sentence" id="907">I feel like that’s your duty to look at it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Or, I couldn’t go to a <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , and it -- I find that very annoying, and many people say that to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">QUESTION:  What are your impressions of how Germans are dealing with, or not dealing with the history of the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">ANSWER:  Well, I’m certainly no expert on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">I -- I see -- you know, I read these -- the answer -- you know, that Daniel Goldhagen’s book is such a hit in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and that they like klesma music, which is sort of weird to me, like it -- I’m sure there are some -- I -- I really don’t know, maybe it is a generational thing, but I -- I think that many Germans -- and I’ve learned that they’re -- heard this from really very well known, and very knowledgeable professors, I take courses in international politics in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="912">They -- They don’t really know what to do with democracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">It’s sort of inbred. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">I’m not generalizing, but they feel comfortable under -- you know, being told what to do, and as long as it’s orderly, and clean, and neat, and no crime, you know, at least, you know, the ordinary kind of crime, that they feel comfortable with that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="928">QUESTION:  About the memorials that you’ve seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">ANSWER:  Oh, the <span class="BUILDING">memorials</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I th -- I -- I -- I didn’t see anybody looking at them, or noticing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">I’ve seen some, they’re -- they’re very subtle, you don’t even know what they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And I’ve seen chil- they’re like in a <span class="DLF">children’s playground</span> , and kids climb on them, or play around them. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">They’re not revered. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">They’re just up here and there, again, only the ones I’ve seen, maybe there are some, but -- but there was one ri-right on the Krufensadum, and very -- right by the main -- the main <span class="BUILDING">subway station</span> , right near the Kaufasdesvestens, this famous <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And it’s -- that one referred to different -- it just mentioned different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , like on a -- on a post, but it’s -- it’s well done, and I think that people just go about their business, nobody looks at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And that’s a spot sort of like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Times Square</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="937">What they do look at, and it is interesting, 1s that <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="938">You must have seen that <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , we bombed out that famous <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> , and they left that standing there in the middle of modern <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , which is quite interesting, but that’s just a reminder of the war, not -- nothing to do with Germans -- nothing to do with Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">It’s very dramatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="940">QUESTION:  Did you notice many differences after the <span class="DLF">wall</span> had come down, on your second trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , in 1998?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="941">ANSWER:  Yes, I did, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I -- They are building there like crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I’ve never seen anything like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And our tour guide, who was excellent, a guy from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , told us, among many other things, that 90 percent of building cranes in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and this really wasn’t a good time to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , 1f you wait a year or so, it’Il be like a whole new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="945">It was just amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">All the -- you know, the Fortune 500 companies, or whatever, of the world, were building there, and they weren’t just <span class="BUILDING">building buildings</span> , they were building like whole plazas, and it’s ju -- tremendous, un-unbelievable the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> going on, which was -- there was nothing going on in -- in 1989.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">QUESTION:  Did you have much communication with Jews living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> today, or in the modern day?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="954">ANSWER:  I did not go, no, I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I don’t -- no, I did not.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="971">ANSWER:  It’s a hard question to answer, but I am sure that it has had a profound affect on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">You know, you think it hasn’t, but it has. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">It has -- I probably would have be -- been a different person. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">I mean, it’s hard to speculate, but I mean, I’m happy that -- that I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but coming as a refugee, I think if I -- if I had been born here, I would be a different person today. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">Maybe not everything for the better, but I think most of if, yes, s -- educa -- and it’s hard -- hard to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="976">QUESTION:  Do you think that the Holocaust has had an impact on either your politics or your religious faith, or any sort of, career decisions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="977">ANSWER:  I think on my career decisions, because my parents -- well then, of course, that was my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Had I been -- Had it -- had not happened, I probably would not have gone on to much higher education. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I guess nobody did it, or almost nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">Here, you have more opportunity, and still my par -- it was maybe more my parents doing than -- and their feeling -- I think they always felt like refugees, all their lives, and therefore, you know, passed that on to me, to get married, and you know, get -- I -- I don’t know why I had to, you know, get married, so I - I just had turned 19 -- no, just had turned 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">My birthday’s in September, I got married in October, but I -- in those days, chronologically, you know, I was just 20, but otherwise, I, emotionally, I was like 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And I was, you know, something that really should not have had -- I should have gone, you know, and furthered, you know, gone for more of a career, and so it -- it did affect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">But what did you ask me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="984">QUESTION:  And also whether you think the Holocaust has had any effect on your political interests and inclinations, and also your religious faith.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="985">ANSWER:  I think it -- on my political inclinations, yes, I think most people are pretty democratic, and liberal, and I think it has something to do with that, of course, because you can see yourself in that same position, in relation to Blacks, or whatever, minorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">As far as religion is concerned, well, I wasn’t brought up on a <span class="BUILDING">religious home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="987">My first husband was very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">I was not, that was a bad combination. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And it sort of, if anything turned me against it, I found it very cumbersome, and cumbering and -- and I just have a tremendous feeling about the Holocaust, and still more as I get older, as I said earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">I still do. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">I -- I -- I have more -- more and more so. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And that, somehow, is like my religion, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">I -- I don’t really -- ’'m not a religious -- I like tradition, a little bit of it, you know, with the family, and we spend the holidays together, but it means more to my children than it does to me, to be honest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="994">QUESTION:  How do you feel about the ways in which the Holocaust has been portrayed, especially in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , especially in popular culture, movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Also, even portrayed in this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="996">ANSWER:  Oh, I think the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> is fantastic, I really do. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">I think it’s a fabulous <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , it’s portrayed very, very well, and all the high tech things, and all the little films you can see. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">I haven’t really begin -- begun to scratch the surface, if I really wanted to see everything, cause I’m never here long enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">If I lived in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , I probably would have done it, but I -- it’s not the end, I’m going to continue to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And in films, I ge -- I mean, I think much more -- I think s -- it’s -- much more is still being said, and I think as we get more sophisticated, and as the generation 1s ready to die out, that there are scholars and people still writing from -- and pursuing it from, then- and researching it from different <span class="NPIP">angles</span> , and different points of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Especially, I’m interested -- I am interested a lot in -- well, like that Daniel Goldhagen book, sort of to prove to myself that -- about the basic German, how could this really happen, that it isn’t just the hierarchy and everything that we know, that it could not really have happened without the cooperation of the ordinary German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">I feel like it’s in their blood, I really do feel that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">There are exceptions of course, but -- I mean, how -- all the little things that happened day to day, how c -- how could anybody take just stones, and smash <span class="DLF">windows</span> , and take an old man in -- into the <span class="DLF">street</span> , you know on an individual basis, when you look at it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Nevermind the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , people that you knew, and were your neighbors, and you knew them all your life, and all of a sudden you turned your back on -- what does it take in a person to do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">You know, one to one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I -- I have to wonder about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">What kind of people are those? </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">And other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , you know, you take a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And they’re just like good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">They just didn’t, and they wouldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">You know, it’s -- I don’t know what that is, when you lump it together as one <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Or the people of -- I -- I -- but I -- and I feel that way, yes, to this day, and I feel that about Polish people, Austrian people, the whole <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , all those people that, you know, when you see modern day movies that were made in this -- last year or this year, and you see these old ladies, with the babushkas, and a couple of teeth, it -- 1t -- you could transpose them into a movie of 1938, and if I understood their language, they’re still -- they -- they’re born with that anti-Semitism, that’s -- I feel that, I really do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">That’s why I never want to go to any of those other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">I only went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , because after all, well, it was offered to me, and it was -- there is a fascination, it’s a morbid fascination to see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And it’s also an interesting <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
