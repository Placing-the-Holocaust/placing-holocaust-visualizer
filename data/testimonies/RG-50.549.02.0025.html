<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None</p>
<p>ANSWER: None</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Your full name, including your maiden name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Okay, I do -- I do begin. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I’m Gerda Haas, born Gerda Schild, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I’m now sitting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minneapolis</span> in my very comfortable <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , with the sun coming in on all <span class="NPIP">sides</span> and you, Katie Davis are interviewing me on this September the 23rd, I believe, is it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  25th.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  25th?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And I understand that the purpose of the interview is to -- to talk mainly, but not exclusively about life after liberation and I really like to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">When I first received the letter from the United States Holocaust Museum about your visit to me, I -- I really, seriously began thinking about my life after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And it seemed a good time, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">This is -- in the Jewish calendar, this is what we call the Assera siamata shuva, the 10 days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, where we are supposed to think about our lives and what we have done and have we done it correctly, have we any regrets? </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Would you like to do it any differently? </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And it seemed a very appropriate time to -- to -- to go through my 75 -- 75 and a half years on this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> and thank you for giving me that opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  [inaudible] One thing we wanted to ask you, was to have you state the full name of your parents and including the maiden name of your mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Both your father and your mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Pll be happy to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My maiden name was Schild, that’s spelled S-c-h-1-I-d. My father’s name was Siegfried Schild, good German name and he came from a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Mian river</span> <span class="RIVER">Mian river</span> , by the name of Hessdorf. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And he was a butcher and in those days, families had to marry off their sons and daughters for a purpose, so since he was a butcher, a -- my grandparents looked for an opportunity for him to marry into a <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It was as simple as that. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">That’s the way it was 1n the olden days. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And there was this Paula Yoksburger in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> , who was one of five daughters and her parents, my grandparents, Sophie and Gabriel Yoksburger were very hard up to marry off their five daughters without money. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">You see, in those days you needed to have money to marry off a daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And finally, they knew of this young man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hessdorf</span> who was looking for a -- what they called a shiduch, a -- a match between himself and someone who was somewheres in the butcher business. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And it worked out fine, even though my mother was two years older and I’m sure there was no great love, but it was a marriage in those days that was called very appropriate and very good and it -- 1t was fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  What did your maternal grandparents do? </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Wa-Was the -- your maternal grandfather a butcher?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Yes, he had a butcher shop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> in Anspach, no sons and he needed to have a son-in-law that would step into his <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And, as a matter of fact, he died very soon after his daughter’s sa -- his -- his daughter Paula was married to this young butcher boy from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hessdorf</span> and it -- it worked out just wonderfully. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">He died and the son-in-law stepped into the butcher shop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> in Anspach and there was my mother and father and soon after -- a year after the marriage there was one daughter, my sister Freidel and two and a half years after that, I arrived, Gerda. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And the only regret my father had up to his dying day, that he didn’t have a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> , it would have been necessary to hand the <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> over to a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">But as it turned out, that reason fell completely away and I guess he got over not having a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">He -- he -- he was okay with his two daughters.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Do you know anything more about your family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> , how long they had been there and had been butchers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Yes, I did a little research on my family at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">The Schild family -- the ones that lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hessdorf</span> , my father’s side of the family, apparently came out of <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> in the 17th or 18th century with that wave of emigration that -- that -- that was triggered by the e-emancipation in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And apparently that’s where my family comes from, because my Jewish na -- my Hebrew name is Sprinza, which 1s Esperanza for -- for a young girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And apparently I had a grandmother or a great-grandmother or some female ancestor -- ancestress I would say, a female ancestor, who -- who was a Spaniard. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And apparently that’s what happened on my father’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">On my mother’s side, the story is that we came- that they came from a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yoksburg</span> and as you probably know, in - in the 18th century, the -- the Jews finally got last names. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Up to then it was Moshe the butcher or Jakob -- Yakob the shoemaker, they didn’t have names. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And apparently, when they -- when the time came, when the decree was passed down that the Jews had to have names, many of them took the name of their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> -- of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> they lived in. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So that’s why you have so many Berlinner and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburger</span> and -- and of small tow -- Frankfurter or Kissinger. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">These are all people that came from particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and that’s how my grandparents were named Yoksburger, because they had lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yoksburg</span> , which is very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">You must understand that, in opposition to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , where the Jews are all clustered and -- and congregated in large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , this was not the case in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">In Europe, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and all the many countries of Europe, the Jewish communities -- the strong Jewish communities were in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , because there the people left them in peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">There was always anti-Semitism, but in small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , very frequently they were able to buy themselves the protection of the -- of the lord. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">They were called Markgraffen or whoever owned these little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and by being servile to these feudal lords and being useful to them, they were able to get the protection and they settled in those small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and they remained very Orthodox, many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">There was nothing else, it was Orthodoxy or nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Would you describe the community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> as -- as --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  -- a strong community by the time that you are aware of it as -- as [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Yes, I would. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">We had the -- we had a rabbi who was a -- a leader in -- 1n -- in the- in the ge -- in the European German commu -- Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">His name was Eli Munck. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">He wrote several seminal books on -- on the pr -- the prayers, the world of prayer for instance and the call of the Torah. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">He was just a very great light in -- in Jewish intelligencia. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And I -- Id like to say this, which many people forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Th-Th-Th-The German rabbis were able to become so great and to devote themselves to writing because they were not hired by the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Here, a rabbi is beholden to his board of directors and to his president and to the wives, in order to keep his job and he has very little time to- to -- to be independent, to think stuff on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But in Europe -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> particularly, religion was a state -- spa -- state sponsored affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Each one of us had to pay a religion tax and the Jewish religion tax went to pay the rabbis and upkeep the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and the other -- the Christian religion tax went their way. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So the rabbis were very free and we were very fortunate to have just two fantastic rabbis in a row. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">When I was very young, our rabbi was Pinhusk Horn, which was also a name that stands forever in -- in -- in Jewish history of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And then we had this wonderful Eli Munck, who devoted himself to writing and to bringing up the youngsters, because he knew that the future of Judaism was in the youngsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I -- I’d like to say one other thing that only occurred to me very recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Th-The rabbis in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> did not urge the Jews to leave and I remember my parents holding that somewhat against Rabbi Munck. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Why didn’t he say, “Go find yourself another <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go to.” </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And it only occurred to me very recently that this was for the obvious reason that the rabbis were state employed, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Do you understand what I’m saying? </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They couldn’t say that or they -- or Hitler would have knocked them off in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">The rabbis were completely dominated by the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And -- and the outgrowth of that thought is thank God for the separation of state and <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So you -- you live a long time before these things really dawn on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">You know, we adored this rabbi and we believed everything he said and we did everything he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But he didn’t tell us to leave, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Think about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Is -- it’s really -- it’s a revelation when that thought came to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">He himself left with his family, after awhile and saved himself and his many children, but he didn’t tell us to leave.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  How did that revelation change how you thought about him or -- or shift how you processed the whole experience? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Because certainly --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  That’s --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  -- his story, Rabbi Munck’s story is something that you mentioned several times in the previous interview --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  [ know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  -- and there was something kind of nagging, I would say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Yeah, first of all, I want to spell his name, so people know who I’m talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">It was Eli Munck, M-u-n-c-k. Dr. Eli Munck and he is very famous rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">He left and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> afterwards and founded a -- a fine, deeply religious Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , Ru cardet. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And I’m still very friendly with many of his children. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Now, how did it affect me? </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I adored the man, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="92">In -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the rabbi was somewhere between your father and God, equi-distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And I particularly liked the Munck family. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I was like a child in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And it didn’t change my feelings toward him. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Also, one of the reasons it didn’t change my feelings toward him was when I was liberated -- and now I’m jumping ahead several years -- when I was liberated to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montrou</span> -- Seulemontre at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laisavont</span> , I found out very soon that Eli Munck and his whole family had fled from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and had established themselves in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And once I knew that, I got in touch with him and he with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And he was the first person I saw again, of my for-former life. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">You can’t argue with feelings, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I loved the man and here I saw him again, after all I had gone through and I credited him in a way with my res- religiosity. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">He gave me that strong belief in God and he guided me through my younger years. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">My parents were busy and making a living and were very simple people, no education. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And he -- he gave me a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I -- I didn’t change my feelings toward him, I have to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It should have, but 1-it didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  Can you describe that meeting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I -- I -- I have several pictures of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We were very friendly here, in this count - after <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , after I got to his -- this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , he went back -- he and his family went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and then he retired and I can’t tell you now the year, but 1t must have been -- oh yes, I can tell you the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">In the 70’s -- in the 19 six -- late 60’s or early 70’s, he and his wife retired and came over here for the same reason we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minneapolis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They had children in -- living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and they came over to retire in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We were still living in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> at the time and my -- my great admiration and love for him and his wife, went so far as to make a new friendship between them and my husband and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And we visited them several times in New York and he came up to <span class="REGION">Maine</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and he came up to Maine and stayed with us for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And I have several letters by him and pictures of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">He was a smallish man, very trim, very neat. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Little beard and dark, alert eyes and he had a little French sing-song accent in his voice, because he was actually born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , but I don’t remember how come. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And his wife was a jolly, roundish, lovely woman, always smiling, always happy a-and I -- I just like them both.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Can you remember back to -- you said that he was the first person from your former life that you saw in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , but remember back to that meeting and what you talked about -- what you talked about at that meeting and whether or not perhaps you prayed together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  No -- well, he was -- I -- I have to tell you a very funny story. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">When we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> -- and I like to talk about that at some more length later on, but just now, in connection with my great friendship with Eli Munck, when I was liberated to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , we -- that whole transport, were again put into a lager -- into a concentration lager, it was nothing like what I just came out of, it was the grand <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in mont -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seulemontre</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laisavont</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I might have a picture of it, it was a gorgeous <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that was emptied out for us, so that we -- these 12 hun -- it wasn’t the whole group, it was maybe 300 people, could be put up in great comfort with this gorgeous view of Lake Geneva below us and Montplant on the other <span class="NPIP">sides</span> and -- and all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Geneva</span> below us and Montplant on the other sides and -- and all the mountains around us, so don’t think it was a -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , but it was a concentrating lager so that we could be controlled. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">We couldn’t roam around. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">We had to check in and check out, we had guards on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We had to always be in -- tell them where we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And so, I wanted to visit my beloved Rabbi Munck in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And somehow -- I don’t know how, I got myself a ticket to -- to go there on the -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It’s -- it’s very -- it’s a very short distance, as you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It’s just a -- a little bit around on the lake of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And I asked for permission to -- to go and the permission was denied. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And you know what I did? </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I left secretly, on my own, to see my beloved rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And you know what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Two Swiss policemen caught me on the train station in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montrou</span> as I was just about to step onto that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in Montrou as I was just about to step onto that train and took me back and put me into what was like a -- a little solitary confinement. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Again, in great luxury, but it was a locked <span class="DLF">door</span> and a locked <span class="DLF">window</span> and I had my food passed in and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">This because I needed so badly to see the rabbi and his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Can you believe it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  You disobeyed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  I disobeyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I thought -- I thought this was more important than -- I c -- I couldn’t even understand why they didn’t grant me the -- so then, to follow up on the story, I -- the rabbi heard about it, because I had told them to meet me at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , so I had to somehow tell them that I was now imprisoned at the Grand Hotel in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laisavont</span> <span class="BUILDING">Grand Hotel</span> in -- in Laisavont, so they came to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And I don’t believe that they let me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I think we talked through the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I -- I don’t have a recollection of actually seeing them, but we saw each other and -- and it was just wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So then afterwards, when things loosened up a little -- this was very soon after I got there and in a way I really don’t blame them. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We weren’t allowed to roam <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> at will, so here was my -- my petition was denied, but then after awhile -- this was in February, or say March, then in April, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paisa</span> -- Passover time, they allowed me to join the Munck family for Paisa. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The things that I remember now, after all these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And the funny thing 1s, tho-those Munck children, who were then -- well, the oldest daughter is six years younger than I am, so I was 20 -- I was 23 when I got out of -- was I? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I think I was 20 f -- 23 or four when I got out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So she was six years younger and she remembers this very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I’m still in great contact with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">She is now |-lady -- the Lady Acobowitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">She 1s now the -- the wife of the Chief Rabbi of -- the former Chief Rabbi of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> -- of <span class="REGION">Great Britain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And we often exchange little remembrances like this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  Since we’re talking about this, Il just continue on with a few more questions about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Can you tell us about going for Passover? </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I’m assuming that would be the first time you really celebrated in your faith --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  -- after the experience of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  It was, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  Tell us about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  I remember that there was one little piece of chicken for the whole family and frau -- Dr. Munck cut it into very, very small pieces and everybody had just a little bit to eat, but it was the very first time that I ate chicken again. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">How strange that I should remember that instead of -- instead of some very spiritual emotions. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I-It was just an emotional event. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">It was just a very emotional event. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I was, of course, very friendly with the -- with the children that were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> , but since then they had had three more and so I was involved with those babies and -- and talking -- the one thing I remember, we didn’t talk about the Holocaust at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They didn’t talk about their flight to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and I didn’t talk about my time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and I didn’t talk about losing my mother and sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Of course, at that point, I was still hoping to find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So, it was just great to be able to travel and to -- to walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and not be picked up by either Ger-Germans or Swiss, that was so funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And it was great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Th-There is one question I have about war time, a-and it is -- it is related to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And it’s, when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , if -- if you could talk a little bit about your relationship with God at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  With God?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  During the time that you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , were you praying, talking to God? </span><span class="sentence" id="172">What were your thoughts about your faith and your experience [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Good question, good question and it’s a question that is to date unresolved, but Ill -- Pll try to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I ca -- I come from a very basic Orthodox family. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">No great learning, but just simple, basic belief that God wrote the Torah and whatever is in the Torah, because God wrote it, you obey it. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You don’t ask why, you don’t argue, you don’t go into discussions, you just do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">This actually helped me, because I so basically and -- and organically believed all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">You see, you say your night prayers every night, you get rid of all the bad things that happened during the day and you only focus on -- on -- on asking for the good things, for the health of your parents and your grandparents and your sister and your teachers and your rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And this helped me a great deal because unquestioningly, I believed that right through the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I remember having the first qualms about it, when I actually learned that my mother and sister had been killed so cruelly. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">My mother, this religious person who gave me all that wonderful belief, how could she have been killed? </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And my sister, who believed just as I did? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And I -- I remember changing <span class="NPIP">places</span> , actually, with God. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I -- my belief was always I had to account for the things I did wrong and all of a sudden it occurred to me, what about the things God did wrong? </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Doesn’t He have a responsibility to me too, that He killed my mother and my sister and my aunts and uncles and cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">All my friends, everybody I had with the all -- sole exception of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And you know, you are -- you were so ingrained with that fear of coming up to <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> when you die and you have to give an account of yourself and it occurred to me very suddenly, God will have to give an account to me, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And from then on, my faith reverted itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I remember that very clearly, because it was a great struggle. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">My father remained completely religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I asked him once what he thought of his wife and daughter being slaughtered like -- li -- like -- like the 6,000,000 were and everybody knows now -- we didn’t know at the time and we didn’t want to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But once we knew how they died, I asked him once, “Doesn’t that impair your faith a little bit?” </span><span class="sentence" id="192">He said, ““That’s the way God wanted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">God did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">God gave them life and God took it away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I guess it’s one way of looking at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">We never ask why we are born, so we really have no reason to ask why he takes life away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">But anyway, what was your question? </span><span class="sentence" id="198">How it impair -- so now my -- I’m still Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I still observe all the things that I learned in my youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Number one, because I never wanted to disappoint my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Number two, because I married a very religious man and number three, it -- 1t gives meaning to my life, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="202">You observe the holidays, it’s great, the family gathers around the Yuntive table and -- and you go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Yuntive table</span> and -- and you go to synagogue. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">But that basicness that I have mentioned before, that -- that organic feeling, that’s gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Now I observe the religion for -- for other reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Because I -- I have to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I have to believe in something. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And also, one of the great reasons that I -- I still -- that I haven’t changed my ways at all is that actually God was very good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Look at my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I have a great husband, I have four very, very nice children. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I have four very nice in-law children. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I have 11 grandkids. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Not one of them is retarded or has crooked teeth or -- or cross-eyed or club feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">They’re all great people. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So how can I not be grateful? </span><span class="sentence" id="215">How can I- how can I be so arrogant as to say, “No, I don’t believe any more.” </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I di -- I didn’t deserve it. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I didn’t deserve this 50 years of sunshine in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So I live with the -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gerda Haas and this is tape number one, side B. Can you tell us about -- can you tell us about how you observed your faith when you were still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  Yes, I -- I’d like very much to talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Let me just go back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">After I left my parents home, at the age of just barely 18, just after my 18th birthday, in 1941 and- in 1940 -- and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to train as a nurse, I did -- I -- I joined the Jewish hospital in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> <span class="BUILDING">parents home</span> , at the age of just barely 18, just after my 18th birthday, in 1941 and- in 1940 -- and went to Berlin to train as a nurse, I did -- I -- I joined the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> in Berlin, asking immediately to be put onto the <span class="REGION">kosher side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">At that point there was still a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> of kosher people and actually, I was able to eat kosher throughout those years that I was in -- in the Jewish hospital in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> in Berlin. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I don’t think I observed the Sabbath quite the way I -- I should have, but I surely didn’t go out and -- and gallivant around. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I may have worked, but I didn’t do anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And then when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> -- and this 1s all still radiating from my childhood, you see, unquestioningly what ga -- God does, is the right thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And then I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and then of course the food became a big problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And I remember to this day, the struggle I had with myself when I finally decided that I’m going to eat that soup that had those little pieces of -- of sinister looking meat floating around in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I -- I refused them for a long time, but finally I thought maybe I -- I should, in order to keep my strength up. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And I remember quite well what a struggle that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And after I had decided to do that, I -- I continued to -- to eat that -- that horrible stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Whether it did me any good or not, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">But when I got to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , I again asked to be put into the kosher contingency. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I-I-It didn’t work out quite that va - mu -- that way, but I'll tell you about that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , I did continue my -- my nightly prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">That became a habit, it made me feel good. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I could fall asleep easily and I felt it was just very necessary to pray for my people. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I knew they weren’t sitting on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> of roses. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And I didn’t know where my father was and how he was faring and of course I always prayed that I would see everybody again. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And I -- I think that answers your question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  And you talked about a period when you began to shift and you -- as you said, traded thr -- <span class="NPIP">places</span> with God and -- and thought about how God needed to be accountable. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">When -- about when was that? </span><span class="sentence" id="242">You said it was when you realized your mother really had been killed very cruelly. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Just approximately the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  Well, I would say -- I would say that was in the 1950’s, when I definitely became aware that they were not coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Up to then, you know how it 1s, 1f you don’t see them die, they are not dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Oh yes, 6,000,000 were killed, but not my mother and not my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And that feeling that the next telephone call is theirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Or the next person you meet in a party 1s my sister and she had amnesia and she doesn’t know who she 1s and I recognize her and I bring back all the memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">These are the dreams and the hopes and the prayers that you have for a long time, until it finally sinks in that they really are dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And I -- I kind of remember too, when -- when that finally happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">When it finally sank in. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I guess it was when my father remarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I guess then I finally gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But for a- for a long time you -- you just -- you just don’t want to believe that. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I -- I’d like to say something about death as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Th-The -- my mother, of course, as I have said in my previous interview, was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> and most probably in -- in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> in front of the firing squads. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And it was a long, long, long, many years before I could say that without breaking down. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And I’m not even sure I can do it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And my sister -- it’s not very clear to me whether she was killed in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or also in front of a firing squad, but again, after I knew all that, I was still hoping maybe they died already in the -- in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">firing squad</span> , but again, after I knew all that, I was still hoping maybe they died already in the -- in the trains, so that they wouldn’t have to -- to do that horrible end. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">But I wanted to say something about my father’s death. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">My father died in 1986, only 12 years ago, at the age of 92. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And I, at that time was about 65 years old, is that correct? </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Or 63? </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Anyway, I was a- certainly a very middle aged woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And until then, I had not seen a relative of mine die of a natural death. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And you know, it was almost a jubilation that I was able to see someone die naturally. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">That I -- I -- that I could sit Shiva, that I could all the things that one does for the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And I -- I -- I remember almost a feeling of joy. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Of -- of -- of -- of fulfillment. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">It was very strange.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  Were you and your father ever able to formally mark your mother’s death in any way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  Well, we needed to keep a day for -- for Yahrtzeit, for the observation of the dead and at the time, the rabbis said that we could pick any day we wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">There was a choice of picking their birthdays or the day they were evacuated, or -- or Yom Kippur, which is coming up next week. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">A lot of people simply keep Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I decided, since my husband’s mother died and we kne -- she died a natural death in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and we of course knew the death date, I decided to s -- to pick that very day and I observe my mother’s and my sister’s Yahrtzeit at that particular date and my husband observes not only his mother’s death, who-who he knows and who 1s buried in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , but also his two sisters, with their five children -- six chil -- six children -- that were killed an unknown date. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And so, at that particular day at my mother-in-law’s day of Yahrtzeit, we light one, two, three, four, five -- we light ten Yahrtzeit lits for the people that we -- for the immediate people that we lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And that’s how we resolved that particular problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">But did you ask me whether my father and I ever talked about my mother and my sister? </span><span class="sentence" id="279">You didn’t ask me that, but I --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  But I'd like to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  Please do. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And that is a great source of anguish to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">For a long time, I -- I felt resentment that my father had left us, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I remember the day in August, the first of Augu -- no, the last days of -- the first of July in 1939, when he left on a transport to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Engla-England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And of course we hoped to follow very soon, but then the war came and we were separated, permanently, in my mother’s and sister’s case, not in mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And I -- I remember feeling great resentment against that, which was illogical and uncalled for. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But again, feelings are feelings and you ha -- you have to deal with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And I particularly felt very guilty -- or -- about my mother’s and sister’s death. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">For some strange reason, I thought that I could have saved them, or I could have done -- done something for them, or I should have gone with them and be there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And my father, apparently never had these feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">At least, he never voiced them in his long, long life. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And to the very end -- I stayed with him a month before he died, knowing that he would be dying and I hung on every word of his that he still said and I was so hoping that he would say a word of -- of - of explanation or resent -- or regret or sorrow or apology or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">But he didn’t and I live with that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  Did you ask about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  No, we didn’t have that kind of a relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">We weren’t brought up to question our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">But I had such a guilt feeling that I actually had to go to a psychiatrist to get rid of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">But he apparently had not. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And I also resented a little bit -- again, for totally illogical, because the man was 45 years old when he was alone, I resented a little bit ha -- that he married again. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">But that was, of course, stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">But there 1s it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  Di-Did you ever become close with his second wife?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  No, unfortunately, I didn’t and I’m -- I’m very sorry about that now. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Because she too lost a husband and two sons in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And she looked to me for a replacement and I just seem -- didn’t seem to understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And just the last few years, I -- I really feel that -- that I missed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">That I really could have done a lot better. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But, you know, there is a [indecipherable] we had a -- a friend who was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and he -- he didn’t distinguish himself in any way, he was just a simple fellow, but he will be remembered in my family for something he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And he always said to us, in his heavy Viennese accent, “You get too old too soon and too smart, too late.” </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And how true that 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I -- I got too smart much too late after my stepmother was long dead, I realized that I -- I really could have done a lot better. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Well, that’s one of the things God can call me to task for. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And He probably will and He should.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  I want to have you think back to right in th-the week or two before you leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and what is your physical state at that point? </span><span class="sentence" id="315">How are you doing physically and mentally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  Well, I was in very good shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Number one, I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And number two, I had worked myself up into a nurse’s position 1n -- into a supervisory nurse’s position in the <span class="BUILDING">children home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And that meant I got S ration -- r-ration -- special ration. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I had no longer to go with my little food pot to -- to the <span class="DLF">window</span> where they dished out a little ladle of soup and the next one pushed right after me and I had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">The soup was now brought to the <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> and we had enough of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Also, at that point -- I’m sure I spoke of that in my earlier recollections, I -- I had a young man who -- who liked me very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">It didn’t amount to anything because you know, we had curfew, we couldn’t get together, but he -- he just adored me. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">He was the brother of one of the women whose baby was in the <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So he came and he -- he worked in the co -- into -- in the concentration camp’s <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ’s bakery. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And he, from time to time, brought me and my f -- and the woman I lived with, Eva, my girlfriend Eva, bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And of course that was a lifesaver. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It really, really was. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And also -- you see, the Swiss people -- the -- I’m sorry, the Czech people that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> were allowed to get packages and from time to time, the Czech women that we -- we lived with in that <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> of ours, below the <span class="BUILDING">children’s home</span> , would grudgingly share their apples or their little bits of f-food that they had, with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">There was a great divide between the Czech prisoners and us, but once in awhile they s -- they had pity on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So I was in pretty good condition and I was picked because I was in good condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">We all -- y-you know the story how I was saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">It was 1200 Jews, each one of them had to appear before the Commandant Ram and we were picked for our looks, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">If we were dehydrated and emaciated, out. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So I was number seven -- s -- I was number 1174 and Eva was 1173 and we looked good, so we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , we got all those delicacies that we didn’t even know what they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Who had [indecipherable] -- who had ever seen a banana before? </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Who knew what a sardine looked like? </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So we gorged ourselves before we even got to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> -- I do need to say something about the feeling that is still so vivid with me, of freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Wh-What actually is freedom? </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Freedom at that point was air that smelled good. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Air that you could take in and breathe. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And people who were smiling. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">People on the -- on the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> that looked up and smiled at you. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">People who didn’t wear stars and had nice clothes and stockings on. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And mainly, freedom was people in uniform that didn’t hit you. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">People in uniform that spoke courteously to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And freedom was beautiful landscape and -- and -- and -- and looking out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and not being shouted at or shot at. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And -- and freedom was just a -- a great relief. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And also freedom was not to have -- Ill say it in -- not in the negative, but in the positive, freedom was to have lights at night, to have a ci -- a -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> lit up, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I had lived 12 years and six of tho -- 12 years in Nazi regime and six of those in war and every night you were taken to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> if you had a little light shining through. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And here was this <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> with all the lights blazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I couldn’t get over it the first night. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Why aren’t they tel -- why aren’t they blacking out their -- it was -- don’t you forget, it was still war. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I got to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> in February -- 12th, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And the war didn’t end and they had all their lights on. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">That’s freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="358">QUESTION:  At what point did you realize you were free or truly feel free? </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Was there one moment?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER:  That’s a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">That’s a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I think perhaps 1t was when they told us to rip off the star and put lipstick on. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I don’t recall that particular -- I think it was when I looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and saw the people smiling and that was all -- what I have said there in such verbiosity was all just one little moment in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We got into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , th-the SS came thr -- it wasn’t the SS any more, it was the -- the Red Cross people came through, told us to rip off the star and put up -- put on lipstick and we opened up the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And then the Swiss p -- the Swiss gendarmes in their uniforms came through. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I think that was the moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And they called us nice, with names and smiled and -- and asked what we wanted and we looked -- I remember that, looking out the <span class="DLF">window</span> , so we would le -- Eva and I -- Eva and I were inseparable at that point and Pll have something to say about that in a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">But I remember we let down the <span class="DLF">window</span> and looked out and we smelled that <span class="DLF">air</span> and -- of course, I’m repeating myself, but that was -- I think that was the moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I -- I wanted to just say something about Eva and I being so inseparable and it ties in with the questions about religion that you asked before. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Eva was not religious and she opted -- wh-when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sengale</span> and we had a list of -- of so -- so-called concentration hotels that we could request and she wanted to go to Les Auvants, there were others who off -- other ki -- <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> <span class="BUILDING">concentration hotels</span> that we could request and she wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">Les Auvants</span> , there were others who off -- other ki -- hotels or places that offered kosher food, which I would have chosen. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">But she wanted so much to go to <span class="BUILDING">Les Auvants</span> and I did not want to lose her, that I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Les Auvants</span> with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And I remember that I- that I didn’t eat the meat then any more, because I was so close to my old rabbi again. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">But anyway, I didn’t stay in Les Auvants very long and -- and then I went to an old friend of mine from -- from the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kissingin</span> , that I found in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lucerne</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Les Auvants</span> very long and -- and then I went to an old friend of mine from -- from the city of Kissingin, that I found in Lucerne. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And there again, you see, Kissinger 1s named because he came from that city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kissingin</span> , where I had a close friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And when this friend of mine from -- formerly from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kissingin</span> whose name was -- was Truda Lustig at the time, but who had married a Swiss guy by the name of Erelinger. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">When she heard that I was in that Les Auvants transport, she immediately requested that I come to her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and there I was completely rehabilitated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kashrut</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Les Auvants transport</span> , she immediately requested that I come to her home and there I was completely rehabilitated to Kashrut and Shomair Shabbat and the whole bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Oh, what a story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  I -- I want to go back, actually, to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And I believe in your -- in your previous interview, you mentioned that an SS officer walked through and he said something --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  -- behave and say nice things --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  And think -- think of us with nice thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Think of us kindly. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">What a farce. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Oh, you remembered that from my interview? </span><span class="sentence" id="384">I remember it, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Remember that we treated you nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">What a farce. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">But we were so taken up with our own emotions, oh, the heck with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="388">QUESTION:  Were you frightened at all when he said something like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Did you feel that perhaps the arm of the SS, if you didn’t say the right thing, could follow you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">ANSWER:  You know, you -- you know, you are asking a very good question and I need to come back to that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Because we were frightened, we thought the SS were reaching -- we -- we had been living in fear for 12 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">In fear for our possessions and our lives and our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Fear doesn’t go away the minute you open a <span class="DLF">window</span> and smell freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">So, yes, I would say we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">But I -- I -- let’s be sure that I say something about that fear that had repercussions to this very day. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I'll -- Pll -- I'll say it later, you had some other questions, didn’t you? </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Perhaps I’d better say it now, because 1-it does fit into the fear business. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">When we got to Les Auvants, after he had told us to remember him kindly, I forgot that. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Consciously I forgot it, but very obviously, sub-consciously I didn’t, because when we got to Les Auvants, one of the first things I needed to do, was to write down things from the past 12 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I don’t know what the other people did, but I si-simply had this -- this - this need to get rid of all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">You see, here -- here I came out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> into this <span class="BUILDING">luxury hotel</span> with all the food I wanted, with that view in front of me and I needed a transition. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And so I asked for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> and -- and some paper, which I got and I stayed in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for several days and just catharsis. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And -- and then I met -- how I met Dr. Clay, I do not remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I think I met him through Eli Munck. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I met -- I met a man by the name of Dr. Clay, who was an official with the Swedish embassy -- <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> <span class="BUILDING">Swedish embassy</span> -- embassy, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">He -- he was high up. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And when he heard that I had written things down, he wanted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And I let him have a copy of everything I wrote, with the condition that he not use my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I still have his letter -- I can show it to you, where he answers me that he will of course honor my request. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">He would like to publish what I wrote, but he will not name me, Gerda Schild, by name. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Now, in the 19 -- late 1980’s or even 90’s, I read a book -- I forgot the name of the author, we can look it up, by the title “Stella”, a famous book where a -- a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> -- a survivor of the Holocaust who stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , one of the hidden Jews, writes about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And I read this book with such intensity, because I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">He talks about street corners where I lived and <span class="NPIP">places</span> where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And I come across a section in the book that was my voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">I -- I could -- I could tell, 1t was -- I said that. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">It was the story of when the nurses came to -- were taken to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kasalen</span> to help these people a-at the Fabric transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And here I am reading, and I said to my husband, “This is my story.” </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And I go quick and I see -- I see where he got this from, he -- it’s a very well documented book. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I forgot his name, I can look it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And he -- he documents my story, anonymous nurse from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and I -- I look and see where he got it from and by God, he got it out of the publication of Dr. Clay from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I wrote to him and I documented -- I wrote him a copy of that letter where Dr. Clay said he will publish it, but without a name and I was really hoping to hear from, but he never answered. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">He never answered and that was, of course, at least six or seven years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">But, you see, that’s how the ripple of fear goes to -- to 1990. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Here I realized -- and this document of Dr. Clay, I see by his notes -- by his footnotes, is in the librar -- in th -- in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> -- in the national library of Paris, the French National Library of Paris. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Isn’t that some story? </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I had goosebumps when I read that. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">But the interesting thing is that I kept the Clay letter, that I know that is my story without my name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="428">QUESTION:  Other experiences of fear, for instance, when you were stopped at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> from visiting Rabbi Munck --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  What was your reaction to the people in uniform stopping you and they took you?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="448">QUESTION:  You ce -- well, you certainly wrote down things that had happened, but when you got to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , did the Red Cross people interview you or ask you what had happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">ANSWER:  No, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I don’t think we would have told them much, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">We didn’t feel -- w-we were very afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">We were -- freedom had to grow on us very slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And that’s why I -- that’s what I like so much on this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Freedom 1s their birthright. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">They don’t even question it. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I like that and that’s why things lik -- like that can’t happen here. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And I -- I -- I always could see it when I was speaking to classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">They ask such -- such unbelievable questions like after I told them my whole story, how we’re driven out of our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and everything, “Why did you have to leave? </span><span class="sentence" id="459">It was your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="460">God bless them, they have freedom written all over them. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">You see? </span><span class="sentence" id="462">But we had to grow into that feeling of that very slowly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">QUESTION:  Do you remember any other occurrences during those first weeks and months where you censored yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Where you found that you didn’t talk about what had happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Or that you felt afraid, I guess is what I’m asking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">ANSWER:  I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I think we were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">D-During the first few months, I think my thoughts ta -- all clustered around the people that were still missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I s -- checked every list I could get ahold of to see 1f my mother and sister would -- would be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And I needed to find my father, I had no address for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">He had left for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , but then he was further evacuated to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And we had written to each other while I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , but not any more in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">And so I -- I wrote to the Red Cross to s -- to see where -- what his address was, but before the Red Cross answered, he already had found my name on the list of those 1200 that had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And again, through the Red Cross, he sent me a telegram with his address and then he sent money and food and it was just wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">But to you quest -- specifically to your question, I think -- I -- I would say with certainty now, that our thoughts were forward and not backward. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I’d gotten rid of it all, ’'d written it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">D-Don’t forget, I was like 22 or 23 or 24 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I -- I wanted to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I wanted to have nice clothes and I wanted to have a boyfriend and I wanted to go out and -- and I -- I was looking forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I guess it’s human nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I wanted to know where my people were and then I wanted to go on living. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">QUESTION:  How soon -- how soon after your liberation did you hear from your father?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  Oh, I would say within -- within a month, I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Because those lists were immediately publicized. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Don’t you know it was one of the conditions that Himmler set? </span><span class="sentence" id="488">He said h-he wanted money and he wanted good publicity in American papers and by gosh, he got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I don’t know if it was good publicity, but he got publicity. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">The list was published and my father told me later -- he’d by then had a little <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> again in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , that’s all he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">He -- all he knew was -- he had no education, so again he opened a little <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> and he said one of his customers came in with the New York Times list and he said, “Siegfried, ist dusnich stanna tauter? </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Gerda Schild?” </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And he looked at it and said, “Yes, that’s my daughter.” </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And then he immediately -- somebody helped him to ask the Red Cross where to send the letter to and I heard from him immediately then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  What did that first telegraph say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  Ah, it was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I still have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">It said, “Where -- where 1s mother and -- and sister? </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Where -- how come you are alive?” </span><span class="sentence" id="501">You know, “Where are the others?” </span><span class="sentence" id="502">He gave me quite a gui -- a guilt feeling then, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I -- I never was on really intimate terms with him because I -- it was like a monolith sitting between us, unspoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But it was always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And, in addition to it, I always labored throughout my childhood, under the impression or certainty, I don’t know, that he liked my sister more than me. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So, you know -- but that’s why I spent the months with him before his death, to see if he couldn’t say a word of love to me, but he never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">He never did, it was not in him. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">He never, never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">It was too bad, but I’m over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">So, what was your question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">QUESTION:  What did you write back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">ANSWER:  Oh, I cabled him, but it was a prepaid cable, you see, one of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">At that point, incidentally, I was as good as engaged to an old boyfriend from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , you see, that again was one of those like arranged marriages and he was here, also, so in the first -- in the first cable that he sent me and he said that he was okay and that this boyfriend of mine, whose name was Lothar, good German name again -- it shows you how integrated we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we all had German names. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Nobody was called a Hebrew or an Israeli name, this was unheard of. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">So anyway, this Lothar also wanted to know that I was safe and I was ha -- very happy and so I cabled back, with love to both these men, my father and -- and this young man, Lothar. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And I cabled back that I didn’t know where my mother and sister was. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And I have that telegram too, because my father saved everything and gave it to me afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  Now, when had this match been made? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">At what point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">ANSWER:  Oh, it was -- it was really not such a terrible match. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">It was, you know -- you know, the young ladies -- young girls in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> weren’t allowed to -- to have boyfriends or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">But this boy, he liked me very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">He lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> all the time to -- to -- so to say, visit his relatives, but he really came to visit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And we had, you know, one of those very innocent, very naive romances. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Even so -- oh, I was very young then, I was maybe 15 or 16 and he wasn’t much older. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And the only way that I was allowed to at all go out with him was that my parents said to themselves, “Well, he’ll marry her eventually.” </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Oh, that was the whole shooting match. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">He liked me enough to really wanted to marry me and he came -- must I tell you all this? </span><span class="sentence" id="529">On the day of my engagement to my husband, he came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> with roses and a little package. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Very obviously he was going to ask me that day to marry him. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">So he was more serious than I. But at that point I had already given my hand and heart to Rudy Haas.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  Was he somebody you thought about then, when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  Yes, I did -- I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  Lothar.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">ANSWER:  Lothar, yes, I thought of him a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="537">It gave me like a -- like a -- a little string to hang on to. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">It wasn’t like a lifeline or anything like that, but you know, you couldn’t think about the camp all the time and death and dying and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So you thought of other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">You thought of pleasant things in your former life. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">You see, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , everything was the former life, but in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , zoom to outer space, to future.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">QUESTION:  So you had found your father and tell us again what you had -- or h-how you had looked for your mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">What were the opportunities available for how you could look for your mother and your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , I looked for them at all the incoming <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , because at that point, I -- I really hoped that somehow they would show up, too, as I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">I -- I had no reason to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , 1t was God’s gift to me that I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">As you know, it was only for old people and war veterans and very distinguished, prominent Jews and Mishlinger. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So wa -- was -- how did I get there? </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So, I thought, as long as I got there, maybe my sister and my mother would get there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So I screened -- I was living in the <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> -- in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that overlooked the -- the railroad -- the mouth of the railroad and I was always looking for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And then when I got to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , the only way was to call the Red Cross and ask for them, yeah.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="746">ANSWER:  I didn’t even want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I was very busy putting my life together. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Having a -- a -- a fiancé and -- and a husband and the baby and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and being able to keep all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Nobody was taking them away from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">It was quite something. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">My nightmares were terrible, but my days were <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="752">The nightmares, interestingly enough, never -- I never dream about my mother or my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I think about them a lot, but I n -- I never dream about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">The nightmares are always that the Nazis are coming to take my children and the life I have now. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">But they’re letting off a little bit now. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I still have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Now, I have nightmares about the grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">My last nightmare was the Nazis were coming and my little granddaughter said, “Oh, I want to run upstairs and get my party dress.” </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Yeah... But that was at least a year ago, so I haven’t had one for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I always wake up in a cold sweat with a -- with fibrillations afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">One of the more satisfying moments of my life was when I was able to give a deposition against Alois Brunner. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I saw a little notice in one of the Jewish papers that people who knew the SS man Brunner should come forward and -- and give a deposition to -- at -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I was still living in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And I called that number and I said, “I remember Brunner only too well and I’m quite ready to give a deposition.” </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Nothing became of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">The Syrians didn’t release him, even so he -- he -- he was quite guilty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">QUESTION:  Where had you known him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">ANSWER:  Sorry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">QUESTION:  Where had you known him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">ANSWER:  Yes, he -- he was -- he was one of the key figures in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> when we were taken from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to the -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and were told that from now on, we were the agents of our own destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">We jolly well could pick up our own Jews, the SS didn’t have to do that dirty work any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And that we could -- that we could do duty in the -- on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ourselves, so the SS wouldn’t have to do all that hard work of herding the people into the -- into the -- into the -- into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">That was Brunner. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And then he stayed for awhile in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and I remember it very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I wrote it all down and you have that on record. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">But I don’t know if I told then that I -- I had been able to give a def -- deposition, that was much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I was very glad to do that, it was a long, long deposition. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">The interesting thing is that the German counsel who -- who took the deposition heard some of the things for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">So I was very happy about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">QUESTION:  Was it -- did you have to overcome your own fear to go do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">ANSWER:  No, that was much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">That was much, much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I wasn’t very comfortable, but it seemed necessary to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">QUESTION:  I want to go back chronologically to you being on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">QUESTION:  And you befriended this officer and he’s told you some about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Do you -- can you tell us about your first glimpses of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">ANSWER:  Oh yes, oh yes, I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">My father had met me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> and after the holiday was over, we traveled by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to New York and then he took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> from the train station to -- to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and then he took a taxi from the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> to -- to his home up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> and of course I kept looking out of the <span class="DLF">taxi window</span> the whole time. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">It seemed difficult to see the tops of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I had never seen a <span class="BUILDING">skyscraper</span> before and I was completely aghast at those. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">But what even impressed me more were the black people. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">At that time they were still called Negroes and what I couldn’t get over was the colors they wore. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Green and purple and -- and red and blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Loud, loud colors. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">I hadn’t seen colors for a long, long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Everything was drab for 12 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Black and gray and -- and green, the Nazi uniforms and -- and that was about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Nobody wore colors. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And here I saw these black people -- first of all, the black color already, was striking. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I hadn’t seen a black person before. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And then their hair was dark and I had only seen blonde. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And then they had these -- these -- these rainbow colors on them, dresses and shoes and fingernails. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Everything was blazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I was very taken aback by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And then we got into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- my father took me in and of course the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> were so different, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And the people were different, it was -- it was difficult at first, it was very difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="810">QUESTION:  Wh-What was -- what was difficult?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="811">ANSWER:  Well, I was still halfway -- half-halfway 1-1n my former life and now I had all this -- this to cope with, thi -- 1t -- I think it was difficult and I was still waiting -- I still felt guilty and I was still waiting for my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And it was a turmoil. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">It was a -- it -- it was -- is a tumultuous time. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Feelings were impinging on me that I -- and impressions that I -- I couldn’t -- that I couldn’t digest right away so quickly and -- and -- and pigeonhole.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">QUESTION:  What did your father -- tell us about your meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I sort of skipped that, but what did your father say to you when he first saw you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">ANSWER:  I don’t recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">I don’t recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">I don’t remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I think we didn’t talk about the past at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">He was, of course, settled by then and he was very proud of himself to have pulled up a little butcher store out of -- out of nothing in -- in New York, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and he was making a living and h-he was extreme -- he showed me his <span class="DLF">door</span> , and -- and I remember he gave a -- a religious object to his <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> <span class="BUILDING">butcher store</span> out of -- out of nothing in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , America and he was making a living and h-he was extreme -- he showed me his door, and -- and I remember he gave a -- a religious object to his synagogue in gratitude that I was saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And the rabbi welcomed me from the -- from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">podium</span> in one of -- in his speech when I first came to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="823">That was unheard of, I was terribly embarrassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And I -- I don’t recall much about that... The name of the man who wrote the book, “Stella” is Peter Wyden, Peter W-y-d-e-n. Simon and Schuster, 1992. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">And my documentation is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sumlongin</span> , Dr. Hans Clay manuscript, CDJCXX70, Santre de document mon taisson juivre contemporare Pari. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">Anonymous parishta Annabelina Crankensfesta. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And they were picked up by Gerhard Shernbrenner and were included in his -- in his book, “Vere haben esska sayen.” </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And that’s where this Wyden picked it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">If that’s important or not, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">But still in -- okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">QUESTION:  Well Gerda, we were speaking about you first getting to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="832">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="833">QUESTION:  Can you describe the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that your father took you to, that he lived in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">QUESTION:  And also the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , please.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="836">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, I surely can. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">He took me to <span class="DLF">719 179th Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="838">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is now razed, because it made room for -- actually for -- for the <span class="BUILDING">bus terminal</span> , that big <span class="BUILDING">bus terminal</span> on <span class="DLF">179th Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And it was a very strange -- 1-in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> , that’s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , but in the Washington Heights section. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And it was a very strange <span class="BUILDING">building</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I had only known <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> where you walk in and you’re in the living room and dining room and the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and out the <span class="DLF">door</span> into the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and upstairs were the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and the kitchen and out the door into the garden and upstairs were the bedrooms. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Well, this was an apartment building where a whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> where a whole city lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">You walked in and you had to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> up to the sixth floor and then you were confronted by long, dark, usually smelly corridors and from the <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> , on each side, <span class="DLF">doors</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">sixth floor</span> and then you were confronted by long, dark, usually smelly corridors and from the corridor, on each side, doors entered. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And little did I know that every single <span class="DLF">door</span> was a whole <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I’d never seen a construction at -- like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">In fact I -- I tried to explain it to one of my friends 1n letters and they couldn’t picture it at all, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">So anyway, we went through a <span class="DLF">door</span> , number 6B, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And there, al-all of a sudden, it opened up into a re-regular <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="849">But you just couldn’t tell that from that dark <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">So here we were and of course the Mezuzah was on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and everything was right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Then when I came in, all the people hugged me and [indecipherable] me. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">There was -- my father was living with an old cousin, whose husband had just died and his brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">His brother and he, I think she had one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and the cousin and her husband had shared the second <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and fortunately the husband just died so that I could have the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Otherwise, I don’t where I would have slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">But how God arranges things for me is just miraculous, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">So I re -- I remember -- of course that -- the ca -- the husband of that cousin absolutely meant nothing to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I never met the guy, he was ages old, deaf and blind and ready to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">I had never even heard his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">But he died when I was still in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and my father- who by that time corresponded with me regularly -- didn’t tell me about his death and only told me on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> that the cousin had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And he said he didn’t want to tell me that because I had been surrounded by so much death and dying that he didn’t want to upset me any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I think that gives you an idea of -- of how they regarded us. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">We were like -- like fragile, ethereal things that you mustn’t upset and -- and don’t tell them anything bad, they’ve gone through bad enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And that was very weird. [ -- </span><span class="sentence" id="864">| -- I still -- still remember that, he was afraid to tell me that this anonymous cousin of mine had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Anyway, I had a good time sleeping in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="866">QUESTION:  Was there some sort of celebration when you came in [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Not right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">On that Shabbat -- you see, that was a very -- very religious community. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Perhaps I better say a little bit about the community, so you understand what it was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">In a way, it was almost like coming back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">First of all, nobody spoke English, they were all -- also, they’d all tried very hard to learn the language and they eventually did and they all aspired to be citizens and of course they all were. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">But among themselves, they lived still way back in their little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="872">The gossip was tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Everything was word of mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">They all went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , of course, in their best clothes and at <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , if -- if you didn’t say “Good Shabbas”’ to somebody, he was insulted with you for the whole week. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And it was such a narrow minded, such a petty little community, that I, who had gone through so much, just -- I -- I was aghast. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">And everybody watched everybody else, that they did everything right and whether they had a new hat on for Rosh Hashanah. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And one person said she’s not going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> because she couldn’t afford to buy a new hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">So I say, “Go in the old hat.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="879">No, you can’t do that, the people will talk about you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="880">It was such a narrow minded, such a pi-pitiful community. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">They had -- you see, they had all emigrated before Hitler really did his job and so they knew nothing of the hardship we would go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And so they transferred all their pettiness and all their parochialism and all their pedestrianism to this beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they just lived within that gorgeous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , still in their old, little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> of -- of maybe 2,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">Was weird. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I had a hard time fitting in. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And everybody gossiped about everybody else and was not for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">I was glad my husband took me out of there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">QUESTION:  What do you think in your experience made you less tolerant of that kind of --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh, who cares whether you had a new hat? </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And who cares if you wore a nice diamond pin or not? </span><span class="sentence" id="889">But if they couldn’t catch up -- and -- and my -- my stepmother was -- fell right into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">Although she too had lost people, she too was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , she worked in the <span class="BUILDING">glimmer factory</span> , her hands off and -- and she had gone through just as much as I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">But as soon as she married my father, she -- she joined that -- that stampede of -- of -- of the Washington Heights Jewish women. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">You had to have exactly the right kind of jewelry and a new dress and a fur coat and -- and she was one of the worst, honestly. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I just could -- I think that’s why I couldn’t get used to -- to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">My mother had been so plain, the only thing she ever possessed was her -- her engagement ring, which I fortunately still have. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">But my -- my stepmother just wasn’t like that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">The first time I met her, she -- she -- that -- that was then again, much later, after I was married, she came to visit me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lewiston</span> with my father, in a fur coat and a fancy outfit, and I ju -- I just couldn’t -- I couldn’t get used to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">So, anyway, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> was a community of it’s own. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">My father only had Jewish customers. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">Only the Jewish religious people from the surrounding s -- s -- few <span class="DLF">streets</span> came to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And once in awhile a -- an inspector would show up to inspect the cleanliness and -- and the <span class="DLF">exits</span> and <span class="DLF">entrances</span> and the <span class="DLF">fire escape</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And my father always was afraid of them, because they spoke English and they were the strangers, they were them, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="902">So that ghetto mentality was still there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">QUESTION:  And even for him, who -- who -- who hadn’t experienced the length of --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">QUESTION:  -- of the -- of the Holocaust through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="905">ANSWER:  That’s right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="906">QUESTION:  Appears very --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="907">QUESTION:  -- powerful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="908">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">He never really -- he never really became Americanized. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">He’s -- he still remained it -- remained just the way he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And I think that was the -- a source of friction between us too, because I wanted to be American. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">I sa -- I didn’t want to be any more like I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I wanted to be an American woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">I remember when I finally went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and then became a librarian and took a job, his comment was, “Why do you need to work? </span><span class="sentence" id="915">Your husband will support you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="916">See, that was the mentality. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">He never understood it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="918">QUESTION:  Can you talk a little bit about more -- your idea of what it was to be an American woman? </span><span class="sentence" id="919">Eve -- Especially in those -- those first few months in -- you were feeling frustrated by what you thought was the pettiness of the community, what were the things that you want people and yourself to be focusing on, to be concerned about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="920">ANSWER:  Well, I -- I didn’t like the -- the Washington Heights mentality and -- and environment at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I -- I -- just wasn’t comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">I knew I was being talked about and criticized and -- and -- and I just couldn’t relate to these bosoms -- fat woman in their finery and doing really not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">They just transplanted themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">So when I came to <span class="REGION">Maine</span> , my husband -- my husband also felt that way about New York and he wanted to be in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and he wanted to be in a small town where he could make an impact and really -- and really be an American physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Then when we moved to <span class="REGION">Maine</span> , actually I ha -- I had a new struggle then. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Then I was expected to be an American -- a young American wife and I didn’t know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And then I -- I didn’t know how to play Bridge, that was the furthest from my mind, so I was already ostracized because I couldn’t ever be invited to Bridge games. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">What were they going to do with me? </span><span class="sentence" id="929">I couldn’t play. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">So, you know, that was already a handicap. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And my English of course, wasn’t so great at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I remember -- I don’t know if this will sit well on tape or not, but I have a memory of trying to play <span class="DLF">Bridge</span> and trying to fit in and finally -- and then you had to always say what you put down, what card, the King or the Queen. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And finally one of the other three American ladies said to me, “Gerda, please stop referring to that card as the ass. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Call it the Ace.” </span><span class="sentence" id="935">So that’s how -- that’s how ha -- ha -- I struggled. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And I quit after awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">I just couldn’t learn that stupid game. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Also, it wasn’t important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And then soon I was pregnant and I had a child and th-that of course, was crucial. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">And I felt very much that I was saved because I should do something ex -- ec -- other than playing Bridge and learning to say the cards correctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And so I -- I devoted myself to my kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">So much so that actually I -- I -- I became depressed after awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I -- I did nothing but worry about this firstborn of mine, because he was actually the first thing that I could call mine and I -- I knew, excepting my nightmares, I knew that he couldn’t be taken away from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Nobody could come in and - and take him, he was mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And so I -- I -- I was between the reality and the nightmares, I -- I became very depressed and actually I did see a psychiatrist, upon the urging of my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And then one of the woman also -- that was also a -- a big factor in my depression -- one of the women, actually the local rabbi’s wife, who was about the age of my mother then and I being without a mother or mother-in-law or anybody and being that poor, displaced person there, she befriended me and she acted as my -- as my dominant guardian. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And somehow, without my really understanding it, I -- I just couldn’t get along with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I just feared her and I -- I -- I never knew how to -- how to talk with her and -- and she -- she was very possessive of me and I was terribly -- actually afraid of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And after that went on for maybe a couple of years or so, I -- my husband, who -- who n -- who noticed that I wasn’t reacting right -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gerda Haas. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">This is tape number three, side A.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  -- put me down sometime -- someday and -- and talk to me and try to find out why I was having such a hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And he pointed out to me -- as so often an outsider can tell you much better what’s wrong with you -- he pointed out to me that she was moving into my mother’s <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I, having that guilt complex a ma -- about my mother, I just couldn’t relate to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Ij -- I just couldn’t deal with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">I was so afraid of her, although I didn’t know why and she of course, didn’t know why either. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And that’s when he sent me to a psychiatrist. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And then, after a few sessions, when he pointed out to me that it was -- all this was perfectly normal and how I could deal with it, then I was okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="956">QUESTION:  What was it that your husband saw that gave him concern? </span><span class="sentence" id="957">I mean [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Well, I was always afraid of this person who called me up and demanded that I call her back and I had to tell her everything that was going on in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">For instance, she was So possessive of me that when I told her that I was three months pregnant with my first child, and I told her as the first person because, you know, naturally I felt some kind of -- of a debt to her for being so nice to me and teaching me English and teaching me how to cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">What did I know about cooking? </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And teach -- and taking me to her friends and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">So I felt a certain debt to her, so she was the first one I told that I was pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Very joyously and I thought, “Oh now she’Il be just so sweet to me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And she said, “Why didn’t you tell me this sooner?” </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And you know, again, I sh-shrank back and this old fear of her came back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And you know, I was just always not just right with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">They invited us all the time and I always feared to go and my husband noticed that something was wrong with me -- with me and that relationship with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">So finally we straightened it -- he straightened it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">QUESTION:  Tell us about your reaction when he suggested you see a psychiatrist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">ANSWER:  That was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I wanted to get over it myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I didn’t know what was ailing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">She was a somewhat dem-demanding and domineering -- a childless woman and she kind of sucked onto me and -- and wanted me to be completely hers and I didn’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I didn’t want to be dominated again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">QUESTION:  When you did go see the psychiatrist, what did you end up talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="975">ANSWER:  Oh, you know, that’s 50 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">Let me see if I can reconstruct that. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">First of all, at that point, 1t was not so accepted to go to the psychiatrist, so we -- we went to a psychiatrist in the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Portland</span> and I think my husband drove me down each time. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And he a-asked about the -- the past and the Holocaust, something about the Holocaust and my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And he also noticed that I had a guilt complex. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And then he told me that I was perfectly normal and that people who go through very great traumatic experiences and come out alive, whereas other people die, as for instance in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> crash or any natural disaster, do end up with a guilt complex and he thought that was quite normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And once I knew that, I could deal with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">I didn’t go many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">He was very good and very kind and -- and I could deal with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Interesting enough, though, I -- I got over it and I adjusted okay, but three of my four children ended up going to a psychiatrist or a psychologist in -- in their formative years. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">Apparently I did pass that on to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And I think they talked a lot about me and -- and my past and my relationship to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">They’re all very close to me now, but there was a time when they just -- they just -- didn’t know just how to act. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I know for instance that -- w-we never talked about the Holocaust and we never talked German, but once the children knew that I had been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and -- and I’I1 tell you in a minute how they found that out, then I began to realize that they were reading under their covers at night with flashlights, books about the Holocaust, but they didn’t dare to ask me, so they visualized that I went through the worst of what they were reading and I think that was the cause of their -- of their m-maladjustment. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And how did they find out? </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Because after I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , at age 49 and then to <span class="BUILDING">grad school</span> and became a librarian -- that was in ‘74, early -- maybe even before then -- then I became a book reviewer for the Library Journal and for some of the Jewish magazines. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And once they realized that I could deal with Holocaust books on an authentic and authoritative basis, they deluged me with Holocaust material. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And then my kids, of course, caught on and asked and -- and then we were okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Was the -- can you talk a little bit about your decision not to talk -- not to tell your children about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Was it a conscious decision or perhaps a decision where you [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I don’t believe that 1t was a conscious decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">I never much talked to my husband about it, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">H-He -- in the beginning, he went with me and heard me lecture, so he knew all about it, but I -- it didn’t seem something I wanted to talk with him about. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">I wonder why? </span><span class="sentence" id="999">It was okay to talk to the psychiatrist about it and it was okay to -- to talk to a -- to a faceless audience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">But it was not okay to talk to my father or my husband or my kids about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Or even my closer girlfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">I -- I did find some -- some of my colleagues from <span class="BUILDING">Berlin Hospital</span> here again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">One of the friends I was especially close to, I found her again and then my head nurse, I found quite by chance in a little for -- Godforsaken <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> and that seemed okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">All we ever talk about was the Holocaust and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and what happened and other friends and od -- it just -- 1t just didn’t seem to come out with my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">I don’t know why not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1006">QUESTION:  What about when your friend Eva would visit or you’d visit her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1007">ANSWER:  Oh, that --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And then the children might have been younger, would you have been talk -- did you talk to Eva about it in their -- in their presence?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1008">ANSWER:  There was nothing to talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">We had gone through the same thing, we were like sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Fortunately sh-she had -- she -- she has by now forgotten everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">She’s maybe getting a little bit senile, but what -- 1f we ever say anything, she doesn’t remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">She doesn’t remember any of the things that are so vivid in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">Like when we washed our hair under that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pump</span> that we had to pump. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">We had to help each other, cause one had to pump and the other one had to wash her hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">I never forgot it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">She doesn’t remember a thing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">So, it -- I -- I have no explanation why I didn’t talk to my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">There was so much else to talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I had to learn English, I had to learn to be a wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">I had to be a mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">There was so much to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">I had books to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">I hadn’t read a book in 12 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Jews weren’t supposed to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">I hadn’t listened to music, all of this I had to do now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">So, my husband was a big, big help to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">He was just an angel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">And I had to get to know him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">I married him while being practically engaged to the other guy and I didn’t even know him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">We only knew each other for three months, but we truly fell in love and I knew that was the man I wanted to spend my life with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">We were just really so made for each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">Our background was the same a-and w-we just entered a very happy marriage and we still have a very happy, functional marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">And it just didn’t seem necessary to talk about the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">I somehow assumed he knew it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">You know how you -- when you’re -- when you’re very close to someone? </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">He knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">And he probably does know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">I’ve -- we never talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">It’s not important, a-at least in that context. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">I don’t know if that makes any sense or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1042">QUESTION:  D-Do you have any thoughts about how your history got communicated to your children if, as you say, you didn’t talk about a lot, but somehow it affected them, is what you had said.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1043">ANSWER:  It did, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1044">QUESTION:  And wh -- ho-how do you think that’s so? </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">How can something that’s not spoken still affect someone so profoundly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1046">ANSWER:  I have to think a minute -- a minute, how to answer you that, because I had never really thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Well, I was -- I was a walking survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">It was probably written all over me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">I had such different values from other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">You know, I couldn’t throw out any food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">I -- I would go to people’s <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> to eat and whatever was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and didn’t get eaten, was thrown in the waste. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">I couldn’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">A-And -- and this business with having new clothes all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Who cares? </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">I had a dress, that was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And maybe some of those things, surely it must have transmitted its-itself to the kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1057">QUESTION:  Can you tell us the story about your son and his ideas about having children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1058">ANSWER:  Yes, I will, but first I want to say this, my -- my children, in a way, by osmosis almost, surmised what was going on and yet, they didn’t really understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">I -- I’m sure I spoke about this when I was interviewed the first time, but 1t seems important enough now maybe just to touch on it once more without going into too much detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">When I was -- when I was asked to be a member of the state Board of Education in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> , I accepted, of course, greedily and then I -- a phone call came -- or rather a notice came that my confirmation hearing was on -- on a certain date in September and I looked at my calendar, it was the second day of Rosh Hashanah and I didn’t travel then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">So, I talked to my husband and he said, “Well, you have to call up and tell them you can’t come and probably they’ll pick someone else.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">So I called up and it was the Senator Katz who was on the phone, who was the chairman and of course, obviously he was also Jewish and he was such a nice guy, I became very close friends with him later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And I said to him, “I’m sorry, I don’t travel on the second day of Rosh Hashanah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">I can’t come.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And he was quiet for a minute and then he said, “You know, I’m Jewish too, I never even knew there was a second day of Rosh Hashanah.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And so we talked about that for awhile and then he said, “Well, then we’ll postpone the hearing for a week -- for a --” I don’t know how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And I was just flabbergasted that this senator from <span class="REGION">Maine</span> ju -- postponed a hearing for me, who was persecuted for being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And I talked about that werbar in front of the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">And my daughter Heddy, the one who’s living here now, said -- still ringing in my ears and she said to me -- she was then about, oh, maybe 14 or 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">She said, “Why -- why do you think that’s so -- so -- so noteworthy? </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">Naturally, if you can’t come because of religious reasons, they have to postpone the date for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">You know, and I -- then I was even more flabbergasted, that my own kid didn’t understand what -- what it means to- not to live in a democracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">I -- I -- I don’t know if you understand the bigness of that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">It was such a revelation to me, such an epiphany. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">And -- and then -- then I probably explained to her at that point that not everybody grows up in a democracy and has democracy in their bloods -- in their bloodstreams, with their mother’s milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">Well, in that case, it wasn’t the case but -- but obviously she was American enough not to understand that this -- a senate does not have to postpone a hearing for a Jewish woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">So then I wrote my book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">And the book just came out of me, because I thought, “If my own kids don’t know it, other kids don’t know it either.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And I -- I wrote my book then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">I- it was the first one, it’s in the preface. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">The whole preface, that’s why I wrote the book, for my kids and for other kids, who grow up blithely and -- a-and then, of course, as I was writing and researching and talking about it and speaking, then the kids know everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">The kids also didn’t want to know all that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">The grandchildren want to know more then the kids now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">But the grandchildren already don’t understand it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">They don’t understand it any -- “What did Hitler look like?

<p><span class="sentence" id="1108">ANSWER:  Oh yes, of course I can, my whole pride and joy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">With the children, I felt I had paid my dues, at least to God and to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">And then the other dues I paid, I want to tell you after I tell you the children’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">So I’m looking at this picture here, which was taken at the brit of my oldest son’s little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And it’s in front of the <span class="BUILDING">Kineset Isel synagogue</span> , with the name clearly visible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">So there’s my husband and I and in the center iv my -- 1s my son Leonard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">Now mind you, all my kids are named after the parents we lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">So Leonard -- which is a burden, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">The kids say it is a burden. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Leonard is named after my husband’s father, Leonard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">And next to him is my daughter Heddy, who is named after my husband’s mother, Hedwick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">And on his other <span class="NPIP">side</span> is my son David, who is named after a distant grandfather and here is my daughter Pauli, who is named after my mother, Paula. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">And then, these are their -- their mates and then in front you have the next generation and of course their names are picked out of a hat and in fact, it is very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">You know, Hitler had -- one of the many laws that he made against the Jews was that the Jews had to have what he thought was degrading names like Sarah and Jacob and Moses and Daniel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">Those were names that only Jews should have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And the interesting fact is that all my grandchildren have Jewish and Hebrew names, not because Hitler decreed it, because those names are beautiful and they like them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">The only one that doesn’t have a Jewish name, actually, is the two adopted kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">But it’s no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">So there’s Rachel and there is Tally and Ari. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And not on the picture are Sarah and Jonathan and Benjamin and Raphael. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And the two kids of my old -- of my youngest son’s, which weren’t born then -- oh yes they were -- is Jacob and Evan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">Isn’t that a great -- nice picture of my family and -- and I’m very proud of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">So I have fulfilled my duty there and then -- and then I want to just mention a little bit that I have also fulfilled my duty to- to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , because after all, I owe it quite a debt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">Quite a debt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And in that way I’m very glad that I moved to small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but that was very se -- very secondary, only after I lived there for many years in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lewiston</span> , <span class="REGION">Maine</span> , population maybe 60 -- maybe 50,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">Only after I lived there for a long time, did I realize that the population, the general American population knows very little about Judaism and almost nothing about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And so I -- I really found a fulfilling role for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">By that time I was a - a librarian at Bates College in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lewiston</span> <span class="BUILDING">Bates College</span> in Lewiston and when we first moved there, in 1947, <span class="BUILDING">Bates College</span> had only one Jewish professor and did not acknowledge the needs of the Jewish students. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Holidays, no time off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">Kosher food never was heard of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">Jewish subjects were never taught and so the Jewish population and also th-the non-Jewish population knew nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And I was able to change that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">I -- I got myself some grants from the -- of course then the times were different, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">This was in the 1970’s, 1980’s, I got myself some sizable grants from the Maine Human -- Council of the Humanities and with the blessing and -- and the encouragement of the Bates College president, I -- I conducted several Jewish oriented conferences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">And they really went over big. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">This was for the whole state of Maine, we had a tremendous budgets, we -- the first conference I did was a month long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">Just informational conference on Judaism and we moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , with people and -- and videos and we talked and we an -- mostly we answered questions and many people in the hinterlands of <span class="REGION">Maine</span> confessed that they had never seen a Jew before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">So I -- I really felt proud about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">And then the next thing we did -- I was able to get a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish library</span> -- a <span class="BUILDING">Rabbinic library</span> for Bates College. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">The -- the -- the husband of the -- of the woman that had oppressed me so, the rabbi of -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lewiston</span> died and -- and by then of course I was on -- on even terms with her and I was able to -- to coax her into donating his whole <span class="BUILDING">Rabbinic library</span> in toto to <span class="BUILDING">Bates College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And it’s known now as the Rabbi David Berund Rabbinic Library of Bates College. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And I’m proud to say that I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">And I catalogued it -- took me several years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">And it’s -- it’s -- it’s -- 1t’s a nice -- nice legacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And then we did s -- then again I got f-funding for several Jewish events -- Jewish music. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">And that was all within that <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , I got money for that and I was able to do a David Berund event annually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And once I did a music -- Jewish music and the other time we did Jewish films and next time we did Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And I got good speakers and we always had <span class="INT_SPACE">standing room</span> only. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">It was fabulous, it was like they needed to hear about Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Not only the Jews, but the non-Jews as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">The students, the professors, the townspeople, the out of townspeople. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">Was fabulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And out of that -- when I realized the need, out of that, I -- then we did Holocaust conferences, especially with teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">And again I felt this - this void. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">This -- this -- this -- this magnetic need that I had and then we finally got together and we had a little bit of money left from the last conference- oh, I don’t know, maybe a thousand dollars and of course we were obliged to return it to the -- to the main Humanities Council, but we asked and got permission to keep it as seed money to found the Holocaust Human Rights Center of Maine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">And we were just sailing through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">It was like they just waited for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">The Maine State Library sponsored us, we had our meetings there, they did all our cataloguing, all our mailing, all our newsletter, our videota -- I did a complete video and oral history tape of all the survivors in my -- <span class="REGION">Maine</span> <span class="BUILDING">Maine State Library</span> sponsored us, we had our meetings there, they did all our cataloguing, all our mailing, all our newsletter, our videota -- I did a complete video and oral history tape of all the survivors in my -- Maine is such a small state, all we had was 25 survivors and maybe less than a dozen t -- much less than a dozen liberators. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">And we -- we -- we interviewed them all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">We also interviewed non-Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">Our criterion for survivor simply was anyone whose life has been dramatically changed because of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And that included a lot of non-Jewish, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">We had a lay -- a layer of -- a s -- of a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> who wouldn’t go along with him and had to leave, with his whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And we had a former Nazi woman who then completely turned around and married a Jewish soldier and came over to <span class="REGION">Maine</span> and became completely de-Nazified and -- and talked about -- and she wrote a book called, “Poison in my Roots.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">She talked about h-h-how she couldn’t help being a Nazi, there was nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">If she wasn’t a Nazi, she was going to be shot, as simple as that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">And she explained that to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">So I -- I really am feeling so -- so pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">We got funding from people we -- we didn’t even approach. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">People came to us with -- with thousands of dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">It was just fabulous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Today we are a functioning, vibrant, rich, busy center.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1180">QUESTION:  Do you go back there from time to time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1181">ANSWER:  I’m in very close contact with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">Just a cu -- just a day or so ago, I had on my e- mail on my computer, a message from -- from our secretary, whom I still picked -- she was hand picked by me when I was still the -- the president and she stayed with us all these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">This was like 15 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And she said one of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> was desecrated on Yom Kip -- on Rosh Hashanah and she wanted me to -- to say something that they can put into their newsletter and of course I wrote -- I’m still very much a part of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1185">QUESTION:  I want to ask you about -- actually I think I will turn this tape. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1186">inaudible] End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gerda Haas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">This is tape number three, side B.</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I -- [just want to continue on some of the things we did in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">After we founded the Holocaust center, we had an annual reception for survivors and liberators at the Blaine House, the State House in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augusta</span> , <span class="REGION">Maine</span> <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust center</span> , we had an annual reception for survivors and liberators at the <span class="BUILDING">Blaine House</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">State House</span> in Augusta, Maine, with the governor presiding and somebody giving a speech and the Mrs. governor passing around the famous cookies and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">And it was always something I -- I personally felt somewhat responsible for, so I always walked around and greeted everybody and made sure they felt welcomed and made su -- and I -- I knew most of them, anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And they knew me, too and -- and one year, I saw a man standing aside and I didn’t know him and I couldn’t place him, he didn’t look old enough to be a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">He looked at least 10 years younger than I. And he certainly didn’t look like a liberator. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">The liberators by then, all had a certain look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">They were a little bit on the heavy side, gray hair -- you know, salt of the earth kind of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">And he didn’t look like that, he looked quite elegant and quite aloof and I thought, “Who is he?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">So I said, “Well, no -- no time is lost in finding out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">And I marched right up to him, after all, I acted a little bit like the -- like the hostess in that’s -- in that context and I said, “I’m Gerda Haas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">Welcome to our reception. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">May I ask who you are? </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">Are you one of our survivors or one of our liberators?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And he -- he clicked his heels you know and gave me a salute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">He was in civilian clothes, of course, just with a military insignia on his lapel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">And he said, “I am Colonel Retired Manfred Kelman, US Regiment --” and I think he named it, which I have forgotten by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">And I was taken aback and I said, “So you are one of our liberators?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">He said, “No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">I am a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">And I was completely baffled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">He didn’t look old enough and he didn’t look Jewish and he didn’t look like a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">Neither did he act like one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">So he and I huddled a little bit, because I couldn’t spend too much time, but we made a date and we met later for coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And the fellow tells me he was a Mishling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">He was brought up by a Jewish father and an -- and an Aryan SS mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">And he was 14 years old when the Nazis finally yanked him out of his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Up to now his mother could keep him and kept her eye on him and he was a little bit protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">Also, as he told me later, he had a miserable childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">He was neither Jewish nor Aryan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">So anyway, by the age of 14, he was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> and there he was again miserable, because he wasn’t a Jew and he had to wear the star all of a sudden and he had no friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">There was nobody 14 years old in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">And so finally at the -- at the end of the war, his mother sent an -- an -- a still functioning army car to pick him up out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army car</span> to pick him up out of Theresienstadt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">But by gosh, the guy was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> just like me, a prisoner of the Nazis, with his star on his left hand side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">And of course we became close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">I just couldn’t get over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And as soon as he -- that finished it for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">As soon as he could, he took -- his father died in concentration camp and he took his mother out and came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and he took his mother out and came to America. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And of course he was a youngster, so he got his education, enrolled into the army, rose to the level of Colonel, went back to fight the Nazis and retired to <span class="REGION">Maine</span> because it was a nice state to retire in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">How do you like that story? </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">That’s -- I should -- I should write that as a novel -- as a short story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I’ve told it many times and it’s just flabbergasting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">So that’s again the envelope of -- of -- of the Holocaust, of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">And he was the nicest, nicest fellow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1231">QUESTION:  Can you talk a little bit about what it was like to be -- what I hear you say 1s somewhat caught between two <span class="NPIP">worlds</span> , when you get to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1240">ANSWER:  Well, I -- I think -- I think I was a little bit on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">I -- I think I have to say I was a little bit on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , by choice and by the rejection of my peers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And -- and I think I made my own little world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">I mean, to begin with that I went back to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> at the age of 49. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">The people thought I was nuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">Here I was, married to a successful physician, why should I go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> like a little girl? </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And sure enough, I was the age of my professors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And that was kind of funny at times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">But I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and then when I was done, I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">And in -- in 1971 that was not so common in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for a -- for the wife of a professional to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">So again, out of choice, I didn’t have time for them and they rejected me because I went a different path. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">So, I had some close friends, but looking back, they were all Europeans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">No, I won’t say that, I have a couple that were Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">But, pre-predominantly, my friends in -- in <span class="REGION">Maine</span> were Europeans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">And then I got so embroiled in the -- in all the activities that I have just described to you and then I got completely snowed under with the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">And they -- they didn’t take part in that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">They did come through when I did Jewish music and Jewish this and Jewish that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">That, they supported me in, but with the Holocaust they didn’t support me all that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">And so I was on my own and I -- I was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">I -- I was satisfied. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">I was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">That’s very funny, I -- I am thinking of -- I -- I had a girlfriend who was also European and we chatted a little bit and our children were in the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">They were small, maybe eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">And I hear one of them say, “My mother doesn’t have an accent, your mother does.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">And I hear my daughter reply, “No, my mother doesn’t have an accent, your mother has an accent.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">So I was different and yet I wasn’t, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">So, to answer your question, you know, it hurt at times when I wasn’t invited or -- or I knew they were talking about me, or -- but you see, also I was very happily married. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">I -- I really- you know, what did I need? </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">I had my kids, I had my husband, I still had my father at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">And also, I did not get along with him as well as I should have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">And I had my stepmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">I had them and they were -- and they were a responsibility as they became older, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">So I -- I -- I was okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">I have no qualms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">And then I became interested in other <span class="NPIP">things</span> and I wanted to build a nice life and -- and I -- I think I Americanized myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">I had a career, I was a book reviewer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">I was always doing something.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1283">ANSWER:  Well I -- I think for a long time it stayed with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">See, I was 10 years old when I was declared a subhuman, an outsider. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">A Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">I was supposed to be -- I was supposed to be ugly, with a big nose and s -- big ears and stupid and the pu -- the real sturmer picture, you know, of -- of kids that were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">And I was supposed to be on the outside of -- of the Aryan world, which was blonde and straight and beautiful and dancing about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">And I - | think when you te-tell that to a kid of 10 for 12 years, I think it will leave an impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">And I think partly that’s why I had a hard time for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">I had to prove to myself that I -- that I was intelligent, that I could do something, that I was beautiful and that I was a good mother and a good wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">I think it took awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">I -- I really do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">I really do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">And I think that’s where all the nightmares came from, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">Subconsciously I was still the fugitive, the haunted one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">And I couldn’t shake it, for the longest time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">And my husband helped me a great deal in that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">He was very understanding about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">Yes, but it took awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">In <span class="BUILDING">school</span> we were not allowed to -- to answer, because we were not allowed to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">You know, don’t rock the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> of their -- of their perception of a Jewish student. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">We were sitting in the back and we were not allowed to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">And we to -- we got passing grades, but nothing special. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">And -- and then, of course, I -- I picked a -- a hands on profession, I became a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">But that was also because of necessity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">No <span class="BUILDING">college</span> would take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">Completely out of the question, because all the <span class="BUILDING">colleges</span> were states colleges.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1308">QUESTION:  Did you ever think about nursing here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1309">ANSWER:  Fleetingly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">I was married to a doctor and I would have to be in the same <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I didn’t want that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And there was so much else to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">I -- I didn’t want to be a nurse, I wanted to -- I wanted to be a student and I -- I was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1313">QUESTION:  You said several times that your husband Rudolf has been very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">Can you t-tell us how? </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">For instance, how was he helpful in -- in helping you feel that you weren’t s- stupid, that -- that’s the last example you just gave, but you’ve mentioned that several times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1316">ANSWER:  Yes, well number one, he wu -- he understood me better than I understood myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">He was completely able to pinpoint my problems with -- with the wife of the rabbi and he was able to lift that from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">And he understood my obsession with my children very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">He was very tolerant about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">And -- and he never probed, he never questioned, he never -- he was never angry, which I -- I don’t think I could have taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">And h-he was just -- I never quite thought about how he helped me, but as I’m thinking -- and he was the one that urged me to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">And when I was done with <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and I graduated fabulously, coo -- summa cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa, all the honors you can have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">So I said -- it was very funny too, for a graduation present, he gave me a new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">Stay here, cook for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">But when he realized that I wasn’t very happy doing that, he urged me to go to <span class="BUILDING">grad school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">He said, “Look into librarianship, that looks like a challenging profession.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">And he was always the one who -- who advised me right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">I na -- just -- he still understands me very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">He still -- he still understands everything I do and -- and he -- he himself 1s still very religious, but I -- my religion has shifted from point A to point B and he understands that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">He -- he -- he knows completely where -- where I’m coming fr -- to use that worn phrase -- where I’m coming from and where I’m going to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">That’s not what I want to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">H-He really -- he really understands my -- my -- my background. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">He himself is of course a refugee also, but he didn’t go through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">And -- and so he -- he doesn’t consider himself a survivor, although I say he is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">Does that answer your question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1336">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1337">ANSWER:  Good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">Let’s see if I have anything else on my thing here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">It was funny when I meet all these people again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">Did I -- did I emphasize once more why we are the last of the survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1341">QUESTION:  Not on tape and I think you should.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1342">ANSWER:  Yeah, Id like to -- to really press hard on that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1343">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1344">ANSWER:  I-It’s so little known that one of the tenets of Nazi ideology was of course that we shouldn’t live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">We -- we should all be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">And that -- that is one of the laws of the -- of the Nazi party, the Jews have to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">But then practicality took over and they figured as long as we can squeeze a little labor out of them, let’s work around that basic law and make a second law. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">And this law -- and I have it here, in -- in Xerox copy, th-the Wannsee Conference Law of 1942 states that when the people come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , anyone under 18 is to be killed on arrival and anyone over 45 1s to be killed on arrival. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">And so they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">So that narrow gap, between 18 and 45 was allowed to sort of kill themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">Die of natural causes, namely starvation and -- and h-hard labor and beatings and infections and finally then of course also, the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">So this should not be forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">So after we, who are now in our 70’s, are gone, there are very few true survivors left, because of that ominous law of killing people under 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">When I tell that to students, that -- they really sit up and -- and take notice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">It was really beastly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">It was really beastly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1357">QUESTION:  You spoke many times in your first interview of this sort of ingrained instinct to behave --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1358">QUESTION:  -- you grew up with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">To obey.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1360">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1361">QUESTION:  You talked a lot about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">Can you speak some about -- about yourself and your instinct to obey now? </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">Is it something that you worked on to change or how has it changed over the years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1364">ANSWER:  You're hitting all the right <span class="NPIP">spots</span> and some of them are sore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">Yes, that was an ingrained instinct, not only because of the Nazis, but you know, we grew up obeying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">We grew up obeying our parents and our grandparents and our teachers and our rabbis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">And our -- our elders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">That’s how we were brought up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">That was the Jewish way and of course the German way also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">And then Hitler came upon the scene and suddenly we had to obey for very different reasons and -- and really k -- knuckle down and obey, or we were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">There was no question about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">They came with their sticks and their dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">And to this day I -- I’m so uncomfortable around dogs and I think it’s because of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">They always had their dogs with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">And we had to give up all our animals, you see, so that there’d be no interaction with dogs or cats or anything, because they always had their dogs on their side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">So here they came, a-an -- and we didn’t even question obedience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">We didn’t even question it and I’m ashamed to say it today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">When they made us the -- the -- the -- the instigators of our own death, we obeyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">Why didn’t we just lay down and die instead of -- instead of obeying them and ha -- aiding them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">We were going to be killed anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">You know that -- I don’t think that occurred to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">We obeyed and that was all there was to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">That’s the way -- you didn’t know you could disobey. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">I -- we didn’t know there was civil disobedience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">That’s an American institution. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">We didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">So we obeyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">Now, to come to this -- to the present, how did I deal with it over here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">I have to really think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">Yeah, we were shocked at the time when the 60’s came and -- and the ki -- and our own kids were sitting s-sit-outs or sit-ins? </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">Sit ins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">I was shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">That didn’t occur to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">And we didn’t al-allow our kids to disobey very much either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">It really was ingrained. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">I guess 1n a way it still is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">I guess in a way it has never quite left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">I remember -- I remember very well that I was married for 19 years and I finally one day stood up to my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">And it’s a strong memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">I thought, “My God, I’m married 19 years and this is the first time I’m speaking back to him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">I-It -- you just didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">But, of course the circumstances were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">Nobody yells at me now or orders me to do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">I do it because I want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">So I think some of that is still with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">I -- I think it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">And the obedience to God, that really never quite left me either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">That is the best I can explain it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">But, of course I’m very much my own person now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">I hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">I don’t know if that answers your question, but it’s about all I can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">But you know, there is a certain freedom in obedience also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">I’m free to -- to do as I wish, e1-either to go along with what’s expected of me, or not to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">And that’s very nice too, so if I go along, it’s because I want to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1416">QUESTION:  Do you bi -- what do you think the Holocaust and the -- the -- the knowledge that we have, how do you think that affected, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> especially, or maybe around the world, this behavior of blind obedience? </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">Do you think it possibly had an impact, that -- that the knowledge that we have of the Holocaust and what blind obedience led to, do you think that has changed that, culturally?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1418">ANSWER:  It’s very hard to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">The wer -- I never thought the world would be in such dire straights as it is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">I really thought they had learned a little something, but they haven’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">I -- I don’t think things have changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">I -- I -- I don’t think the world as such has gotten any better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">But I -- I think -- I think this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> at least is more aware of not blindly ob-obeying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">Of not blindly walking along and doing their own thing and I -- I’m very thrilled about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">But I think they’re going overboard now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">Th-This freedom to investigate everybody, that’s too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">That’s almost again like Hitler, this perse -- this - this persecution of a person or -- of a person, that -- I -- I just can’t see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">That can only lead to more trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">But -- but th-the liberty to criticize anybody, right up to your president, that is a thrilling aspect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">That reporters can -- can have a say of what they think, that’s unheard -- that was unheard of in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">Every newspaper had to print what Hitler told them to, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">And that’s why it -- it became so widespread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">So I think the world has learned some things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">That people have to be honest and have to say what they think and have to stand up and march for their rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">But 1-1n other wer -- in other parts of the world, not too much has changed and things are still pretty bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1436">QUESTION:  Which <span class="NPIP">part</span> of the <span class="NPIP">world</span> <span class="NPIP">part of</span> the world were you thinking of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1437">ANSWER:  Well, I’m thinking now of -- of where people are really oppressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">Of <span class="REGION">Third World countries</span> where people ca -- one of the truths of -- of -- of political life is that you can’t rebel unless you have already reached a certain level. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">And Hitler made sure that the Germans never reached that level. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">He kept them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">But Third -- <span class="REGION">Third World countries</span> can’t rebel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">They haven’t got enough food in their stomachs and not enough voice in their lungs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">But here, where everything is so great and wonderful and people can do as they wish and have the -- the personal strength to do it, they can rebel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">But while they were slaves, they couldn’t do anything about it either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1445">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1446">ANSWER:  So there’s a -- a natural gra-gradient up the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> where for a long time they can’t do anything about it and then as you get a little better, a little higher up, then you can object and can make yourself heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">And you should. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">But each <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and each person has to find th-that uphill grade by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">End of Tape Three, Side B Beginning Tape Four, Side A</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Gerda Haas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">This is tape number four, side A. Have you traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1451">ANSWER:  Yes, I went back at least twice to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> , that beautiful, baroque <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with the beautiful cobblestones and the [indecipherable] and the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">See how pretty it is, with <span class="DLF">stained glass windows</span> and these gorgeous roofs all covered with that tile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">And I -- I -- I -- I used to like my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , I w -- I was a v -- a very happy girl there, before Hitler and I used to love it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">I remember so many little things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">M-My grandmother once took me to the -- to the Hoffgarden, which is like a arboretum, at night when I was very little, because there was a Queen of the Night that was opening up at night and she wanted me to see that and I never forgot it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">It had such an aroma to it and at -- it -- I could see the petals opening, I was just a young girl and it was dark and there were these white petals opening up and throwing their -- their perfume at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">I never forgot it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">So there were many reasons why I liked my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">But I went back and I -- I -- I was most unhappy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">I felt so -- I felt as if I had an itchy skirt -- shirt on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">As if I wanted to scratch myself all the time and get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">And Anspach was notoriously anti-Semitic and it was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">I -- I had -- I wanted to see the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , which is a -- a beautiful, <span class="BUILDING">historical building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">It was built by the same architect that built the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> for the margraff there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">At that point the Jews were in -- in good standing with the margraff and they asked for a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and he -- that was in 1745 -- 300 -- 500 -- 400 years ago and he gave them his own architect and helped them build this beautiful <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , here it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">See, this is the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> has the same high <span class="DLF">windows</span> , that I’Il show you in a minute, if I can find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">So, I was very anxious to go back and I had to ask for the key to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> at the -- at the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> , because now it’s closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">There are no Jews living there, so it’s just a memorial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">And I went to the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> and I asked for the -- for the key and they told me that -- I asked in -- in German, you know, I didn’t want them to know who I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">And -- and I asked and they said I had to wait a few minutes, the fellow th-that -- who I had corresponded with that I was coming, Mr. Lung, will be here in a minute, he’s out celebrating his birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">And I had noticed that on the letters that he had written to me, telling me I had to come and get the key myself, he never used his first name, he always said his title, whatever it was, Raths -- something Lung and there was no first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">And so I waited a few minutes and he came back from his birthday party and I could figure out from the date that where we are now and hi -- this was his 50th birthday party, that he was born right smack in the Hitler regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">And when he came in, you know, the whole <span class="BUILDING">office</span> exploded, “Oh, g- glerkil -- glerklishan kiportstak, Adolf.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">So you see, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was so anti -- so pro- Hitler that they named their little kids Adolf. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">And that’s why he never used his -- his name, he was ashamed of -- he could change it actually, he’s sitting right there in <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">It’s not hard for him to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">But you know, you’re -- you’re fine tuned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">You pick up things that other people would -- that then I would never have picked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">He didn’t use his name and he was born just -- just 1933 and his parents named him Adolf in -- in -- in adoration of their fuehrer, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">So -- so everything contributed to my being very uncomfortable there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">And he gave me the key and I went through the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and of course as soon as I had opened up that very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , other people came, pushing in and of course he didn’t allow that, so he cut my visit short and you know, everything was just against me and I da -- I wa -- I wasn’t happy there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1482">QUESTION:  Did you go look at your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1483">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">I looked at my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which again, I was so happy there and I thought, “Oh, I just want to see it once more.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">But it turned out to be a terrible experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">Number one, I walked up those few steps of 200 Strasserfunfe and I look at the little plaque that’s there and it was still the man who drove us out, who got the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from us from prac -- next to nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">So, by implication, all my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and all my belongings and all my stuff must have still been in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">Cause he surely didn’t throw it out or do anything with it, we had left everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">And he moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">He moved into a ready set <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and made up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">So, I already had that feeling, oh, what am I doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">And then to make things even worse, he had one of those big German Shepherd dogs that I -- that I feared so much, both physically and mentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">So, of course, I didn’t -- I asked if I could walk through and at least see -- see the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and everything, but -- he said yes, but how could I with that dog sitting there, you know”? </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">So that was a very bad experience and I turned right around and walked out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1495">QUESTION:  Did he know who you were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1496">ANSWER:  No, but I think he guessed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">Who else would come and look at an 0 -- a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that had no historical significance? </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">I may have said I lived here once, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">But I didn’t kno -- but I had my daughter with me, who -- the one who 1s living in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> now and we started out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> to -- wh-where she had relatives and we were visiting and it took us very little time to come by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> , just across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> <span class="RIVER">Rhine</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> , it was maybe -- maybe a two hour car ride and she came with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">And I was extremely taken by her reaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">She -- she couldn’t believe that my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> was -- was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">You see, in her mind, it was some -- someplace on the moon, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">And that the people who bought my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> were -- were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">In her mind they were monsters that were living in Dante’s Inferno, you know”? </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">And they were here, right there, she saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">She could touch the doorpost and -- and see their names and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">A-And she was flabbergasted that two hours from her, there was actually where it all took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">I -- I never even thought of -- she was so moved by that experience, she was just beside herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">And we took her to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and -- where my parents used to stand and as - which is a beautiful, beautiful <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , I’m so sorry we lost that to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">I made a little bit of an effort to have it transposed t-to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , as some <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> have been, but I didn’t get any res -- “No, that’s ours now, that’s a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , there’s nothing to do with you any more.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">And then I asked for a -- some records, “Well, we don’t have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">We sent them all to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .”” </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">They were anti-Semites and they still are anti-Semites. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">And they always will be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">And my other da -- we took my other daughter, Hedwick, the one that’s named after my father’s -- my husband’s mother to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> where my husband’s parents are buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">And she had the shock of her life, too, because she saw her name on the grave-gravestone there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">She still goes by her maiden name, Heddy Haas and there was Hedwick Haas, buried under a stone with her name and she was also -- she finally realized she’s named after a person that’s lying there, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">So, really the children open up your eyes all over again.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1535">QUESTION:  I want to ask you one thing, that your mother was able to send a few things, stuff them into people’s bags --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1536">QUESTION:  -- and then -- could you tell us what she was able to send and -- and how your father eventually got them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1537">ANSWER:  Yes, I -- I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">You see, when we finally, finally realized that we really should leave -- also our rabbi never urged us to and people began to leave from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> , they were packing their belongings, their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and the whole business into large lifts and were sending them over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">And my mother was able to give little packages to a few of the people to take along. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1540">Take it,” she said, “take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">Maybe we’ll show up there too, someday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">And if not, you keep it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">So these were friends, you know, it was no great danger that they would walk off with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">And if they did, you know, who cared, nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">But they -- nobody did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">So when I came over here -- and also when my father came over here, all of a sudden people brought him things that -- that were his and he didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">He didn’t know he -- I have such beautiful tablecloths that my mother and my aunt hand did and you know, th-these were important things for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">And then a few pieces of silver, like this here, just a tiny little ashtray. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">One octagonal and the other ecliptical or what do you call that shape? </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">Very finely chaste and -- and molded and lovingly polished by me, every so -- every so often, because I -- I Just love those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">They were my mothers and she thought enough of them to stick them into somebody’s bag and I got them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">And her own -- her own engagement ring, she gave to my father to take along and he kept it on him until he was able to give it to me and I have already given it to one of my daughters and little things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">Very few things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">This Shabbas lamp, for instance, that is an old lamp that the people used before -- actually before wax candles and before electricity to light their Sabbath lights on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">It had oil in it and wicks and before Shabbat you would light all the -- all the eight arms of it and it would ga -- go for at least 10 or 12 hours and that way you had light. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">And I happen to have the one that was in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1557">QUESTION:  Could you share with us -- you have mentioned before, in your first interview, the letters that were exchanged between your father and your mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1558">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1559">QUESTION:  And can you tell us about how you came to receive the letters and then I want to ask you to read, perhaps, the last two letters that you wrote to your father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1560">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">Okay, these -- my father was already in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and mother was stuck in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">You see, we had to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anspach</span> and had to move in with some relatives in a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">My sister was already then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfort</span> , at the Jewish hospital as a nurse and I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> as a nurse and I was in Berlin as a Jewish nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">So we were all separated and in order to save postage, which was -- was a big deal in those days, we would write to my mother, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and then she would include our letters into hers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">But, as you can see here, there’s a note from Freidel and possibly a note from me somewheres too, but not right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">So here she writes, on N-November the ninth, on a Sunday, in 1941 -- yeah, I was wrong, was the September date, I -- I blacked out there for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">September was her birthday and she wrote to him at that time -- and I think it’s in here, too, that she got as a birthday present what everybody else got too, September 19th of 1941 and that was the star. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">And whether my father caught on or not, I don’t know, but she couldn’t outright say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">But I -- I understood it when I reread her letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">So I got my dates wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">On November the ninth, she was beginning to be de-deported and she says, “My dear Siegfried, it is difficult to me to wr -- for me to write to you today, because I have to give you sad news. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">I have gotten my notification for transport, for the transport that leaves here on Tuesday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">I’m so sorry for you and for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">I know you will be upset, but I beg you, dear Siegfried, don’t grieve and don’t be pessimistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">I am calm and I’m not excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">The children feared deporta-deportation already for a long time and have been worried about me all this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">Tomorrow I must call them and talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">I only hope that they will be spared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">I beg you, dear Siegfried, don’t be upset and don’t be sad and most of all, do not blame yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">If anyone deserves to be blamed, it is I, because it was I who urged you to leave without us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">We human beings are a thing of naught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">I see it clearer now than ever before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">All our planning, our hopes and toil comes to nothing when God decides differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">I think now, if only I had done this or that, but it’s no use. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">It’s all destined by God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">Here I am, making a farewell speech, but as yet I hope that I can write to you where I’m going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">I haven’t heard anything from mother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Redensberg</span> or from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berta</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aidid</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">I hope they will be spared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">I will write to you a second letter today before I must go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">Lovingly, Paula.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">Yeah, that was the ninth of November, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">And she wrote that same day, another letter. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1593">My dear Siegfried, to continue, I have a letter to send you from the children also; it’s a week old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">I had hoped so much that Freidel would be able to come for a few days before I would be deported, but really, I didn’t believe that I would actually be called up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">And now it’s a reality, as I told you in the first letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">I am in the first evacuation from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">I don’t imagine it as all too black and I’m not upset and of course Ill write to you from there as soon as possible, but don’t be concerned if it takes long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">And I repeat, dear Siegfried, don’t worry about me and don’t reproach yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">Fate 1s stronger than we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">If it’s God will that we will be reunited, He can arrange that from there, just as it is His will that I could not get to you from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">I’ve packed already, have taken all my warm clothes along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">Frau Kaufman, the old lady who lives with me is also in the transport and many of my old friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">Together our lot will be easier to pare -- bear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">Now my dear Siegfried, I have just talked with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">Freidel wants to come with me and Gerda too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">I don’t know if they can get travel permission and at any rate, they should stay and keep in contact with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">Farewell.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">On the 11th she was deported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ausch</span> -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">She was 45 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">On the ninth she was called and on the 11th she was deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">And the ways of God are indeed strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">My first son was born on the ninth and my second son on the 11th of November.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1613">QUESTION:  And when did you receive those letters [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  My father gave those to me when I came over here in ‘46.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1614">QUESTION:  So it was right away in ‘46?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1615">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">He might not have given them to me, but of course I knew about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">I tell you, he gave them to me when I was writing the book, 1n °83, but I -- I was aware of them anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">I knew he had them, they were all still in their original envelopes and of course the envelope had to say, Sarah Paula Sarah Schil-Schild and -- and it also had to say who took the letter to the <span class="BUILDING">Post Office</span> and then it was opened up by the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">It’s weird -- weird. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1621">QUESTION:  We were speaking about your books and the -- the writing that you’ ve done has also sparked letters from various people and you’ve mentioned this letter from a young girl and I wonder if you could tell a little bit about that letter --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1622">QUESTION:  -- and then perhaps read it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1623">ANSWER:  We'll wind up, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">I have a stack of letters here that you can see is quite an impressive collection of -- of -- of letters that I received from my first book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">And you know, I got only one criticism in that whole time on the first book and it was from a Polish man -- a Pole, not a Jew, who objected to my stating in the book that the Poles were the most anti-Semitic nation in -- in Europe and he pointed out to me in that letter, which of course I saved, that the Poles had done a lot for the Jews back in the olden days, which 1s correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">The kings of Pole -- <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> took the Jews in and let them prosper there and indeed they prospered in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">The Jewish community of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was outstanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">But during Hitler time, I remain with my -- with my statement that <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was the most violently anti-Semitic country in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">But all the other letters, except for that one, were -- were with me -- were with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">Some were eye openers, that they didn’t know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">Some said, “Yeah, I was there too and you described it just right.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">Others thanked me for opening up and others complimented me for being able to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">And that was, of course, in ‘83, after my first book came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">Now I wrote a second book and that came out in ‘93 and I wrote that for a younger audience and you know, the interesting thing 1s, I did not get the response that I got the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">It may have to do with the editor’s broadcasting it less, publish it -- publicizing it less. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">But I give the book to Bat Mitzvah and Bas Mitzvah -- and Bar Mitzvah kids and kids that I think would understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">They are 12 and 13 years old and they should know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">And I gave it recently to one of my little -- little 13 year -- 12 year old friends who had a -- a -- a Bat Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">She lives actually right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from me and she writes me, “Dear Dr. and Mrs. Rudolf Haas, thank you very much for celebrating this special occasion with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">Your gift was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">I finished the book with a completely different attitude toward the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">I was often afraid to read Holocaust books, because I feared they would give me nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">Reading the stories of all these people made me realize how many good people there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">I also need to remember that the Holocaust was a reality and it wasn’t a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">Thank you for everything you have done for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">Sincerely, Sophie Rappaport.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">And that was now -- that’s a young girl, that -- the third generation after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">It still lives and they still want to know.</span></p>
