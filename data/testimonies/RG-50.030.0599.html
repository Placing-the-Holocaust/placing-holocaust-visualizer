<p><span class="sentence" id="1">QUESTION:  I'd like to first start off by asking you to state, again, your full name, if it's different now than your name of birth, date of birth, parents' names, siblings, family, <span class="NPIP">place</span> , all of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  All?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  I have no idea why that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I was born <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on the 27th of December 1929. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My father and mother are deceased. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My father was Carl Wolff or referred to in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as Charles Wolff. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My mother was Erica Wolff, born Abeles. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">The maiden name was Abeles, Abeles. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My -- I have two -- two sisters; Susan Barbara Wolff living today still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and Eva Berta Wolff who died of -- of multiple sclerosis in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> many years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> 's name is Fogelstein, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">It's not Wolff anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">She's married to Henry Fogelstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> was Hertzfeld. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Both married, incidentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We were just talking about that in the conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Somehow there 1s a connection of survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">They both married survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">What else can I tell you? </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My children, do you want that too?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Great ideA:
ANSWER:  -- which 1s -- you know, they have no intention of going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but this is an open <span class="DLF">door</span> to the EU --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  -- which makes sense, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">That's a really good ideA: Great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  Let's talk, if you will, about your earliest memories in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> for the first nine years of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I clearly remember a few things about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I can remember being stoned, finally, on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> one day by children that I played with just the previous week. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">They were, obviously, put up to this by their parents, but that was sort of our -- my message to me and to my sisters to not return to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So that was my end of my schooling in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I was nine years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I was, I remember, being angry at my father for not allowing me to join the Hitler youth, which you got to go on outings, camping trips, and hikes and like the Boy Scouts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  But of course as a Jew they wouldn't have taken me anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">But I really didn't understand too much of that at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It didn't become really obvious to me as a nine year old until Kristanant (ph) when I can clearly remember them, the Gestapo, knocking at the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> to arrest my father as it was common on the night of November 9th, 1938 to arrest all male Jews above 13 or 14 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I was too young, but they were after my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My father knew he would be arrested, but wanted to go together with his brother-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So he went over to his brother-in-law's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and thought they would be arrested together. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">My mother greeted them at the <span class="DLF">door</span> as they came in, in her housecoat. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">It was about Midnight, full of -- the housecoat, I remember, was full of my -- the metals that my father had earned fighting for the Germans in the first world war. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">He was a much decorated major in the artillery, in the mounted artillery, actually, and was heavily wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And she thought somehow that that would exclude him from being arrested, but of course it didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They didn't really -- weren't interested in the metals. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And they wanted to know where he was and they went and got him. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Luckily enough, he was released about a week later, because one of the arresting officers actually had fought under him in the first world war and knew him personally from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And many people were kept for months some were never released. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But that finally opened his eyes that, gee, maybe we should really do something, try to get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">He has two brothers, incidentally, who are married and had families. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">One went three years earlier to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and one went two years earlier to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But my father -- I discussed this with him many times -- thought like so many German Jews that this guy -- this upstar Hitler would blow over. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It's a passing thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We've just got to tough it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Things will get back to normal again. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And a lot of- alot of Jews, German Jews, felt almost more German than Jewish in that respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">You've probably heard that before. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So he made -- he made moves to -- after Gustalac -- opened his eyes and he made moves to try to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">We had a very distant uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">You had to have -- <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> had no Open Door Policy and you had to have somebody vouch for you over here that you would not become a burden to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> or- to the state or go on the welfare rolls.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  So we finally did get an exit visa to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And we -- and on April 20th -- I remember April 20th, 1939, happened to be a -- that's the date of Hitler's birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We left for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Stayed two months -- two months in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> waiting for some kind of transportation to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We only had a transit visa in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> so it wasn't -- wasn't a -- couldn't be a final destination. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He stayed -- my father and mother stayed with his brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I was -- there wasn't enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , so I was put on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> somewhere in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Devonshire</span> where I remember being very, very lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Couldn't speak a word of language -- couldn't speak a word of English at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Had to point to food and things like that and had to -- never really lived on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">My sisters, incidentally, went on the Kindertransport a few months before we left; about six months before. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">They both were adopted by British families and they were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Kindertransport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Both sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Then we finally got the -- on the SS Dinzeldike (ph) <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch freighter</span> with -- had room for 30 passengers going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> through the <span class="DLF">Panama Canal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Thirty days on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Very exciting for a boy of 9.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Get lost on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and go to <span class="NPIP">places</span> where you're not allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And -- and I remember it as a very exciting -- exciting voyage, except we were told we were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> and the only thing I ever heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> was the earthquake of 1906. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So I figured, well, probably going to live in a <span class="BUILDING">cardboard shack</span> there because they can't have any permanent <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">It must be all black lava sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I had this weird idea of what a -- what an earthquake country would be like --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  -- until the day we sailed under the <span class="DLF">Golden Gate Bridge</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  You know, and then of course, it was -- it was quite -- quite different. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">But it was a very weird expectation of where we would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">At this time, my father was the only one of our family of five that spoke English. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">He had been to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> as a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And my sisters had picked up a little in their couple of -- in their six months in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">I spoke practically none at all, because during my time in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I wasn't there long enough to go to any kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Schooling or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So basically I grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And we arrived during summer, so by the time <span class="BUILDING">school</span> started, I pick up a lot of English on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">For a nine year old it's very quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I was supposed to be, by my age, in fifth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So they put me in fourth grade because I didn't speak enough English. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And then they let me jump from fourth to sixth later on to catch on with my -- to catch up with my age group. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But, what else can I tell you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  Well -- so, this is wonderful, because, you know, it gives an overview --
ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  -- of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So if it's okay, if we just go back then and then maybe highlight some of the moments, you know, and talk --
ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  -- about any -- any other memories --
ANSWER:  Yeah, sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  -- related to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So, again, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and then before the stoning incident, had you experienced anything else, had you seen anything else? </span><span class="sentence" id="120">What was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Well, this reminds me of, as you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> has a policy of inviting Holocaust survivors back to their original <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">birth city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  So several years ago -- that's been about eight or nine years ago now -- we were both invited back; my wife to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and I was invited to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And they show you the - the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But during that time while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , someone from the archives, much like you, came by to interview -- have a personal interview, get the story of each one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So I did that interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And then several years later I was called by a movie producer in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , Nina Koshofer -- who was Nina Koshofer, who was in the process of doing a very, very ambitious project of a documentary on the Jews sponsored by German television and <span class="BUILDING">French televisions stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">That's called -- do you speak German at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  I don't speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  It's called -- in English it's The Jews, History Of A People. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">In German it's (speaks in German). </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And it was running for -- it's a five-hour documentary. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">It was running for five consecutive days on television, an hour each. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">It was sort of -- it ended up sort of a little bit like Roots was in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , which was the history of black slavery.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Here you may have seen it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Which also ran about four or five days in a row. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And it was a very thorough documentary. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">She spent three and a half years traveling to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , everywhere to film this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So she had some good funding from these <span class="BUILDING">television stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And believe it or not, she brought her whole -- whole camera crew over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Luis Obispo</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> and filmed us, and filmed the Shabbat, the evening meal which we had to stage on a Sunday night, instead of Friday, because she happened to be here on Sunday --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And did quite an extensive interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So this -- this documentary ran. [</span><span class="sentence" id="151">have a DVD of tt.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  It ran both in Europe and it has not run on PBS yet but it's scheduled. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">It's scheduled to run on PBS.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  Wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  So it really starts sort of with Moses and ends with our family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Luis Obispo</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  Wow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  So it's really long. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">It's interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">But she -- the reason I was picked for this is because of this interview that I did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">She ran -- she read through all these archives, all these interviews --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  -- and said, I need somebody who has been kicked out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who was a hero in the first world war. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">They really wanted to interview my father, but because he wasn't alive anymore, so they settled with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And one of the -- one of the episodes of my life that they -- they staged in this film with somebody portraying the young kid -- nine year old kid portraying me, which might be interesting here, was because -- you asked me to go back to remember things. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I remembered very clearly the Gestapo coming in and surveying all our belongings, which they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I still have a list of -- a very, very detailed list. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So many handkerchiefs, so much linen, so many knives, forks, and spoons; all the inventory. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Most of which was confiscated. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Ones -- we were allowed to take one knife, fork, and spoon per person. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">For a family of five we could take five things with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And anything of value that they wanted too, any ornamentation that we had around. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And we had a large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vase</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vase</span> , a carved glass vase with a gold rim on the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And I noticed they were going through getting anything -- any metals of any value, silver or gold, or anything that they were confiscating. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So while they were rummaging through the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- I was watching this -- I took this vase and held it under the kitchen faucet under hot water and wanted to see if the rim would come off. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And tapped it, and believe it or not, the rim came right off. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So they took the rim and they left us the vase. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We still have the vase 1n our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">They were only interested in the --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  -- in the metal part. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Not the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vase</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">It's a large carved glass vase. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I thought it was quite handsome. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Anyway, that part they staged in this -- in this little film, the history of the Jews there, and -- and a lot of my father's exploits in the first world war as a major. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I'm not sure what else I can tell you except the thought of this has never -- the thought of our background is somehow never very far from -- from my -- I've been a Professor of Architecture at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and I've concentrated on minority populations. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I guess -- I'm guess it's related to the background of minorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And we do talk to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> groups and college groups and various groups in -- in CaliforniA: I would like to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I haven't done that yet in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  It would be interesting to do that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Now ask me something else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">That's wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Thanks for sharing. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">If it's okay, can we talk about your sisters and the family's decision, you know, the process of making the decision, what happened, how it happened, to get on the Kindertransport?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I've never quite figured out. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And you know, it's -- it's interesting that after your parents die you think of all the millions of questions that you wish you would have asked them, which of course, they are not ask-able anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">But I was relatively frail, underweight and very skinny. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And for some reason or another, my parents decided to keep me with them and put them on the Kindertransport rather. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Maybe they felt I was too young. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">My wife was six months younger than I am when she was put on the Kindertransport by her mother, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">It's also very, very hard for me to conceive, as a parent, to conceive of what you must feel like to give your child up into the unknown, because you generally prefer the devil that you know that may be existing with you than the devil that you don't know and you have no idea what you're giving your child to this...

<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">My father was a -- started a <span class="BUILDING">coffee firm</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , importing coffee and processing it from <span class="COUNTRY">Guatemala</span> , so that's all he really knew was coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So when we came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> he started peddling <span class="BUILDING">coffee house</span> -- until he found a firm here, he started peddling <span class="BUILDING">coffee house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , selling coffee by the pound from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , by foot, because he never learned to drive in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">He had a chauffeur. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Over here he just never learned to drive, even all the years he was here. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But after about, oh, I'd say six months approximately of peddling coffee he realized he could not support a family of five by selling coffee, and yet that was about the extent of what he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So he found a job on the <span class="DLF">San Francisco waterfront</span> and became a stevedore. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And for the first time in his life really did -- did physical eight to five. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">He was a union member and working on the waterfront. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And told me, I remember, that in many ways he preferred that because at 5:00 he could no longer -- he would no longer have to worry about his -- his business. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">He was -- his time was his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">He worked strictly from eight to five. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">It was tough physical work, but he was free of any -- any kind of other concerns and obligations. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And my mother started being a saleswoman in a <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">She started -- first of all, she started cleaning <span class="BUILDING">people's houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">She was a domestic house cleaner cleaning <span class="BUILDING">people's house</span> for many years and then she became a sales clerk in a <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And so we all -- we had pitched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">We all had some kind of jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">There was a Jewish Council of 1933 which helped us get an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It helps you get settled a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I still spoke, always, German when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and English in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So my sisters also had jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I started sweeping out - [remember my first job sweeping out a <span class="BUILDING">plumbing store</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> for eleven cents an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">When I finally figured out how much I was making an hour, I quit and got the job at 20 cents an hour somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">But that was -- yeah, that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">So I never really had a much -- through <span class="BUILDING">junior high</span> and <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I never had any much social life at all because I had a job after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> almost all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So we all sort of -- we all sort of pitched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I was the only one of the -- I was the only one in my family fortunate enough to go to a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">U C Berkley</span> and studied architecture. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And got drafted into the U.S. Army during the Korean War, which was -- they sent me to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which was a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be during the Korean War. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And it was very interesting for me, because I would -- this was 1955, ten years after the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And I could very easily put on civies and go into a <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> and sit down and have a beer and listen to everybody refighting the Second World War which was fascinating for me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And an awful lot of denial going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Hitler, who was he? </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And you know -- sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Or I -- I was not a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And I always would ask what time -- what point they joined the Nazi party, because if they joined 1n the late- in the -- '44, early '45, '43, then they probably weren't convinced Nazis because by that time they had to join 1n order to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">But those who joined in the early forties, and even the late thirties were pretty -- pretty convinced of that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">So anti- semitism was not that -- I had no desire to -- to live there. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">I was glad, glad to be part of the US Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">That was --
QUESTION:  (Inaudible).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">It was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">In fact, I was there during the time when the Germans were being asked by NATO to rearm and develop their own Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And I was a corporal. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And we had -- we started getting orders that when we meet German officers we were to salute. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">I could never bring myself to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So I'd go down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and a German officer would start approaching me. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And of course, the -- the lower rank is supposed to salute first.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">ANSWER:  And the upper rank then returns the salute, but with me it was -- I was -- I teased them to call me, but they never really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">But I would never, never salute. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Finally, when the officer gets up to me, he salutes --
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">ANSWER:  -- you know, and then I would return the salute. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Or I would not -- no. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">Actually, I did not return the salute. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">But as far as expecting to be called out on this, and never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">They probably suspected, oh, this guy's Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">He's not going to salute me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  And it was interesting at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I did a little research on my own and found out that in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> nothing was -- at that time, nothing was being taught at all about the Nazi erA: They did -- they do now. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">They have picked it up a lot, but at that time, ten years after the war it was just total denial.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Let's just do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So I'm going to just pause it and then... Great. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So we are recording again after a pause with Paul to collect our thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And once again, we discussed you would like to tell us about your grandparents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="442">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I was unfortunate to know -- only one of my grandparents was alive when -- when I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And that was my mother's mother; my grandmother, Rosa Abeles, or Omas (ph) as we called her. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">She -- we tried very hard through the Red Cross to try to get her out afterwards because she refused to come out with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">She was old, elderly, overweight and -- and devoted only to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , really. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Didn't have -- didn't -- would not leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> under any circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And we tried very hard through the Geneva Red Cross and finally learned at the end of the war that she had died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> where a lot of older people were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">After doing some research at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> when we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> years later, we looked up the date -- the dates that she was there, which <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is of course incredible at recordkeeping. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">They keep records of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And we found that she was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> for about six months period until she died, probably of starvation, at the -- at the same time that my wife's grandmother was also at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">They could have possibly known each other years and years before we ever met.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  You know, I didn't meet my wife until 1960. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So it's very possible that they might have known each other, as it is just one of those very strange coincidences. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I'm often asked in talks in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> what affect this has had on -- on my faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And I have to admit that the whole experience probably made me more Jewish than I would have been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because we are relatively secular Jews and am still -- I do -- we do belong to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> here as we did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , but it's reformed. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">As you know, Jews have reformed conservative and orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So it's very much on the liberal or reformed side here. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">But certainly, I felt more Jewish because of what's happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">It was interesting when we first came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> -- this was almost a couple years before Pearl Harbor, but only -- we arrived here 30 days, directly 30 days after the war in Europe broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">We arrived on August Ist. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">The war started September 1, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And we were treated as enemy aliens here. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">We were considered German. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">When the Japanese were deported from the <span class="REGION">west coast</span> after Pearl Harbor, there was serious talk about doing the same thing with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">They never did it because our skin color was not so obviously different from everybody else's skin color, but there was serious talk about also doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I remember the FBI coming into our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> , confiscating a Grundig radio that we had brought over because they thought it might receive shortwave. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">It didn't receive shortwave of course, but they confiscated it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">So at this time the Deutsch of Bund, the German Bund was marching up and down the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> holding demonstrations. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> really had not a clue as to what was really happening there at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And I was very instrumental in our little community here. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">We just finished building the very first LEED certified <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">A LEED is an international standard for rating energy efficient <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">It simply means Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And so I was quite instrumental in getting that designed and built and LEED certified. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So I am active in that respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I think the effect that this whole thing has had on me more is to -- is to really be very, very conscious of any type -- any types of discrimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Right now I'm working closely with a Moslem group which is getting a lot of prejudice in our <span class="REGION">area</span> , and in many <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Kids are being picked on in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">There's -- there's just a lot of -- a lot of the same kind of ignorant prejudice. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">It comes really out of ignorance more than anything else, of not understanding and not even wanting to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">You know, when I went back in the military to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I was the first Jew that many Germans had ever met, or had any contact with whatsoever, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">But when they said, we had no idea of what was really going on, that was very questionable, because they -- well, maybe they knew enough not to ask the right questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">That was -- but they did see their neighbors disappearing and -- and all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">One thing I left out is that after I got out of the US Army, I took what was known at the time as a GI Bill of Rights which allows you to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">They give you a small stipend. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I think it was $150 a month, which would make it very difficult to study in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> at a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , but I could do graduate work in architecture in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So against my father's best wishes, I enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and spent a couple of years there doing graduate work in architecture. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Had a very, very international class, a master's program in architecture. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And a professor, who had fought on the front in the -- Sep Ruf, a well known architect in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , who had fought on the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And one weekend decided to put us all in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and take us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , which is just outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And he insisted that I ride with him in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And he tried to make a strong case for the fact that he was a soldier on the front, an officer on the front, and not really knowing what was happening back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , as far as the Jewish problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I still -- I still have suspicions that if they wanted to find out what was happening, not only to the Jews at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> but to the Jews of the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that were -- that they were occupying during the war, they could easily find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Even an -- even an artillery officer could find that out, what was really going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">But he took us to the <span class="DLF">memorial</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And explained to us all -- the memorial at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> had just been built. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">It was a very -- it was a very emotional trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I was the only Jew in that architecture group, but the group was -- only included two Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">The rest were from, really, all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">They had students from everywhere that came together and had a chance to experience that very, very powerful visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And they seemed to -- beginning to really understand what -- what kind of mass hysteria had taken place there, even though this was just ten years after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="505">ANSWER:  As far as getting back to the faith issue, there 1s a -- there is a -- a Jewish saying of attempting to heal the world, of acting in such a way, behaving throughout your life in such a way, it's tikkun olam, which means to heal the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And in some small ways you're supposed -- ideally, it's to lead a life that would help to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So I've gotten very involved in, at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , working with the homeless issue, which is prevalent in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> also, and in creating a sustainable <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that does a little bit maybe to heal the environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And it was -- by the way, it was the first LEED certified <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And hopefully -- and since then -- this was three years ago it was -- it was certified. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And since then there have been many others that have also been certified. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">So if any affect it had on me, it's made me conscious of individual prejudices. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">When my wife and I talk to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> we try to get this across to kids as to picking on. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Right now there's a big thing all over the news about bullying and what -- what harm that can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Bullying because of -- you're gay, or because they're Moslem or because you're different from -- from the -- so the idea of differences and how we -- how we treat differences and how we only seem to gravitate to our own kind all the time needs to be addressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And I think very slowly it 1s, but you know, it's very dangerous what's happening in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> right now because when they say that the hysteria of Naziism was only because the Germans are so focused on the fuhrer, on a leader, that they will follow the leader over any <span class="DLF">precipice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Some of the things we're seeing now, some of the preyudices we see with the <span class="BUILDING">mosque</span> being proposed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and what have you, it could happen here just as easily I think as -- as having anything happen in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the 1930s. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So we're not -- we're not above that. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">There are an awful lot of -- well, I won't get into politics too much, but -- okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">QUESTION:  That's fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">QUESTION:  Is there anything else you'd like to add?</span></p>
