<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  What was the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that you were born in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gletwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Why don’t you tell me about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that is what you remember of it and when you were a small child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  It was a rather small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">We had one <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> which was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> and I went there from first grade until fifth grade and that was in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">At, I was in the fifth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I had some very happy memories and let me start with saying I also had a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">She’s born October 19 in 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">That’s the only sibling that I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My parents and my, rather my father was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> which later on became <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">So when he was about 14 years old he left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because he didn’t want to be under the Polish rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">His parents however remained there. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My mother was born in a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and she had one sister and she lived with us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Now my grandparents on my father’s, the parents of my father, they remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they had 9 children but 2 of them died before and one was killed early. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I don’t remember exactly when, when that child was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I do however know that they were very orthodox and very, very religious and my grandmother would not light any lights on Shabbos. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">She would carry a handkerchief pinned to her dress and had a head piece which was like sort of a lace bedekom which is something that they wore. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And she wouldn’t even turn on the electricity or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And she had servants, but these servants were not even allowed to do that either. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So they had to wait from sundown to sundown before they could eat warm food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  Why don’t you tell me the names of all the people that you just referred to. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I don’t think we have that down yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">You could perhaps start with the parents of your parents and work forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  My grandmother’s name was Dirka Miyinski and my grandfather was Louis Mijinski. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">They had a lot of children but I only knew about a couple of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I remember one aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">She had twins. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Her name was Erna and I don’t remember her last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">There were two boys, twins, boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Then the other aunt was Anna and she had one child when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and there was, this the one Anna lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">The one I just referred to with Erna, she lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Then there was a George, the brother of my dad who was a couple of years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">He also was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He had one son. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So that boy now lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">The other people that I barely know but my grandmother, my maternal grandmother was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And her name was Anna Zusman. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Her maiden name was Hyman and my her husband was the first Jewish locomotive engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And he worked his way up from being a coal boy but shoveling coal into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">engines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And he just went higher and higher until he became an engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">He loved <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that much that whenever he was on vacation he would stand at the trestle and watch all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> go by. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">He just loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And my earliest recollection was of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">He had a stroke. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I was 5 years old at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And he was paralyzed completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And he could speak but nobody could understand by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">He talked to me about all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that he was running and all that information which he just loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And I had a very close relationship with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And being the very first grandchild, I’d say my grandmother Anna spoiled me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  I don’t think you said the name of your maternal grandfather, the one who worked for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  His name was Beno Zusman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Why don’t you tell me a little bit about your family life, what you remember because I know you were very young and how your parents lived their lives and what you and your sister were like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  My father was out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">As a matter of fact he was gone sometimes for weeks at a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And my mother and her sister and my grandmother were very close and they would take trips together with us children and by the way my aunt Ruth K, her name now was last name was Karliner but before that she was married to a Banger and they used to take us to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and we had wonderful times. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">It was like a <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> which was <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> was called <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Reinerts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And I don’t really know what kind of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> they were, but I do remember having a wonderful time up there with everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Climbing and, and using sticks where you put metals on them telling you what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> you were in which I thought fascinating. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And it usually was around my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So they would have to kind of sneak the gifts into a suitcase so that they could surprise me when I woke up on my birthday that they would have a present for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I surely didn’t expect it because I mean we were so far away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But they did that for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And going back again to, my sister she was born when I was five like I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And she was born in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Our regular <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We didn’t have a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in this case. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But she was born and my cousin is the same age and she was born about 14 days prior to my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And she didn’t tell her husband that she was going to have the baby that soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , that’s my uncle, uncle Herbert was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It was aunt Ruth’s husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">He came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he said what are you doing in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And she said oh nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I didn’t feel that good. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">She says, go look at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">doll carriage</span> that Margie has. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And he said what. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I’ve seen that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> and the dolls a million times before. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And she says go take a look and go look at it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Well finally to get him to do that, I urged him on. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So I said uncle come look, come look, look at my Suzy. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And he looked in there and there was this child. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">My doll’s name was Suzy so he didn’t know that it was areal child. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">But it was so funny because he couldn’t get over it, that this little baby was in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And he had no idea what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And then my sister came a few, exactly two weeks later. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">One was, my cousin was on the third of October, my sister was born on the 19 of October. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But my dad was out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> as usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And he did have an inkling that when he came back there would be a child there. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And sure enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">In those days you didn’t go to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">You had a midwife. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And then I loved playing with the babies you might say because they were like my own doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And I was able to hold them and play with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So that kind of grew because when I was about six years old, my parents put me in charge, my mother put me in charge of taking care of my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And I would, I roll her up and down the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">But then being a young kid, you know you kind of forget about what you’re supposed to be doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And a girlfriend of mine would say hey let’s play hopscotch. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So I did and the next thing I know my sister falls head over onto the <span class="DLF">cement</span> , screaming, crying and I was so afraid to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I thought oh my I’m going to really get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because my, they could hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I guess the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> could hear my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">She was really upset and a little hurt but not really drastically. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she was still screaming and my mother says what happened what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I said she fell kind of with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> on the cement. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">How could you. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And my grandmother said what do you expect a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">She’s still a child herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">You shouldn’t punish her. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So I got away with that one too. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And later on we, where I was living they had always a fair once a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And that was run by the gypsies and they were living in these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">house wagons</span> lined up along the <span class="DLF">plaza</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It was like in the, on Fridays they would have a <span class="BUILDING">market</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">and the rest of the time, at times they would have a fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They would have carousels and big wheel and that was a big treat for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And because my sister was too small, we couldn’t’ take her and neither could we take our my cousin because she was the same age. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And this was maybe when they were about three or four years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And one night I remember very well, my aunt goes <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Her daughter was missing and she got a shock of her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Where could the child have gone to. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">She was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We combed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Everybody was running around and finally we located her oh maybe a half a block away. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Somebody had seen her walking as a little kid in the middle of evening, dark already and they took her in and they said you wait til your mom will come. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And sure enough she was sitting in the <span class="DLF">window</span> looking out and when my aunt came by she said oh there’s my mommy. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And that was one of the things I really remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Very, very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I went to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> and that, that was a wonderful <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">When I first got there however, the very first year they asked us for a physical and they had this big <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> and you went from one doctor to the next. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">One was a doctor for general. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Then there was a doctor for looking in the eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">There was a dentist that looked in your mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And of course they wanted us to be stripped to the waist because they wanted to take our I guess our vitals. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Anyway, I wasn’t about to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I was too ashamed to show my body. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And they said it’s ok, you can do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I took my clothes and ran down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and I didn’t want to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So then the teacher came over to my mother and she said did you know that your daughter ran from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and my mother said no, why would she do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And she said well she didn’t want to undress. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And my mother said, well of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">She’s very shameful of showing her body you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And I never lived that one down. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Ever since then, everybody is always laughing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">The kids used to kind of snicker when they saw me. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">What are you ashamed of. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">You’re not developed yet or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But it’s I was only about six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And I mean to me my body was kind of precious and I wasn’t about to show it off to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And anyway, my sister, Eva, her name is Eva Renart. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I don’t know if I mentioned it prior to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">She went to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , also a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish kindergarten</span> and she had a wonderful time as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And as I think back, we, my parents well that is my mother and father if he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and my aunt and her husband, they went to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> every Saturday faithfully. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Of course in those days you didn’t hire any baby sitters, you used the older child. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">That was me. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And I would have to play <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and entertain the young ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And that was kind of fun because we played <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I was always the mother and they were the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And of course they had to behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Otherwise I would punish them and put them in a corner or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And those are really very, very good memories for me because I enjoyed what I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And then in see we lived in <span class="REGION">upper Silesia</span> , so we were protected by the Versailles contract or however you want to call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I’m not sure exactly the wording. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">But until 1935 Hitler could not touch us. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">But in 1935 Hitler then said no more Jews to leave out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So my dad couldn’t go anymore to the in his business to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Polish forests</span> and to the <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia Russia</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So the Nazis took him for forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And he was digging <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and they were there was water accumulated over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And he got quite ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So in 1938 we did get, in the early part of 1938 we received an affidavit from our uncles. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">That is my grandmother’s brothers who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Battle Creek</span> , <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">They posted an affidavit but when my dad heard that there, you know he had, I don’t know, he was very smart man. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">He had an inkling that things were going, not going to go so well for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">So he decided rather than waiting in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> we should go ahead and go to another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that’s affiliated with the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , wait there and then as soon as our visa became valid that they would give it to us, then we could go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">That was the plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">However, that wasn’t exactly what took place.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Before we get to the to your leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I want to go back a little bit so I don’t forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Why don’t we talk a little bit about what you remember about where you lived, what your parents were like, what it was like when your grandparents moved into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  Well my grandparents moved in once my grandfather got the stroke. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">They could not, my grandmother wasn’t able to take care of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So we had moved into a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that had three <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And one was occupied by my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">One was occupied by we rented out one and the other one was my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And my grandmother and my grandfather had a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we enjoyed going in there and talking to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Oh let me tell you something else that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">When I was about six years old, I think it was something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">We had Passover and my father always wore the white kitle and he was a very, he came from a very orthodox family. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">So he wore the white kitle like I said and my grandfather who had a stroke couldn’t get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So he sat there and asked the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Of course it was us children, so they were still kind of tiny and they were just sitting and like in a little not a playpen exactly but something where they could contain them because they were just crawling around at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And all of a sudden I said you know dad, you look like a beggar. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Oh, my dad got so upset at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">How dare I say you look like a beggar and my grandfather, my father was so upset at me, my grandfather being he couldn’t speak very well, start in his own way yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Well the women all were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> trying to bring the food out. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">When they heard my father yelling and my grandfather trying to yell and me crying they dumped all the dishes on the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">That was my mother, my aunt and my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">They came running. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">What in the world happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And when we told them what happened, well it wasn’t a big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">But to me it was horrible that my dad would get so upset that I said that. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where I lived was mostly Catholic or Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I think it was more like Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So the girlfriends that I had in our very immediate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> were all Christian kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So but they never made a difference between my being Jewish and themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And they would call us and say come on and play with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And I would go out and play with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And until they very day that we left, I never knew that they would even, have a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So to me I was accepted as their equal. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">There was no discrimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">The schooling had to be in, I had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> because I guess maybe the others wouldn’t accept us. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I really don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">But I started the first grade and went all the way up to fifth. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Like I said before. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And that’s the only way there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But one of the memories I have that also that I loved to dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And do gymnastics. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So at a very early age, my mother enrolled me into a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for gymnastics and I wanted to become a gymnastics teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Or a ballerina. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Anything that had to do with dance or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And I was pretty flexible and I enjoyed it very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And then we would put on plays, like little dances and so forth and with that we would then entertain our congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Or we would go to the <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span> and perform over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">It was really a lot of fun and my mother made sure I had the most beautiful costumes. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">One of the ones that I really remember is that I was a butterfly and my girlfriend was the flower. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So I could dance around a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And we, these are just wonderful memories and I had also of course a lot of Jewish girlfriends, that is when <span class="BUILDING">school</span> would let out. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I would go over there and play with them and one of the girls had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Well I didn’t have one. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So she would let me ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Well the first time I got onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , I headed right straight for the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rose bushes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And I came out of there looking and a mess, scratched up from head to toe. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">You might say. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">But I didn’t care because I had fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">It didn’t matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I was learning how to ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I did it the hard way perhaps but I got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And let’s see what else. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">The, one of my girlfriends Hannah Weissenberg, she was my very best friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And she didn’t live all that far away but not in our immediate area, so only time I could play with her was either right after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or when my mother would take me over there and pick me up because we just didn’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And as I said before, there was another girl too that I only know now the last name, Richar, was her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But I couldn’t be very sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">People left you know, some had left already. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">The moment in 1935 they would leave and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">But my two girlfriends that I you know I had really close ties with they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as long as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Now there was another girlfriend that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Her father was very orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Her name is Miana Shy. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And she we found her again in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> but that was a very strange situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I didn’t even know she would be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So but let me go, get back to that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">While I was in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I learned English. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">However it was not the English that people in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> talk or in the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">It was Oxford English. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">The eithers and the neithers and the looking glass and all that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Well when I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I went to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the kids all made fun of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Because I didn’t speak like any of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And they would snicker and laugh and like ridicule me. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And I felt really bad about that because that’s the only English I did know. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">But anyway so in like, we can go back to the time we went and got the visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">My dad like I said kind of saw the writing on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and he said we’re now leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> you hardly bought any dresses ready-made. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Everything had to be made. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">By material and the dressmakers and the dressmakers were a few blocks away of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And so my mother had started putting things into suitcase because she knew we had to leave in October and this was now around Rosh Hashanah. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And during Rosh Hashanah somebody came in and told my parents you'd better get out now. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">They’re going to be closing the <span class="DLF">border</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So we rushed out of the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , the middle of services, went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , started putting things into the suitcases and then we had to call the government official to put a seal on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Once it was sealed you could not break the seal unless you were outside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So I remember us rushing through and getting everything ready and which is what my parents did. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Then the official came and then we had to leave with ten marks in our pocket.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  Margie, why don’t we go back just a little bit and why don’t you tell me if there was anything that was particularly Jewish about this <span class="BUILDING">Jewish German school</span> that you were required to attend for first grade on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  Well the only thing is they did not teach <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> or Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So we had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> for the lessons from the rabbi and the cantor. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And we learned the different, we learned all about the holidays and how to keep a <span class="BUILDING">kosher household</span> and all that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">But basically all they really went into the math which is actually German, math and a little bit of geography of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">But and the English lessons that I had over there because I knew that eventually people were going to be you know going to different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and they felt that we should learn English. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">We did however, my Hebrew wasn’t all that great. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So my dad said that I have to have private lessons and Mr. Kamm, K-A-M-M. I remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">He gave me private lessons in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Well I became pretty good at it so when my dad would go out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I would have to do the Havdalah. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And I must say it went very well because my mother said go ahead, do it, do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And I enjoyed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Because I was the focus point. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I mean I was the head of the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And let’s see what else. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">It’s very hard to remember all the different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">But, oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Hanukah. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Was a wonderful time. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And I had as I said before, a lot of Christian children around me and our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Well I would go for Christmas always upstairs and see their tree and at midnight they would have all these candles and goodies on the tree. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And I was like I said I was accepted and I would partake with their Christmas celebrations. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Well I came down and talked to my mother and father and I said you know we don’t have anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Why don’t we have a Hanukah bush or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Well they didn’t quite go along with that idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">However, my father surprised us as playing Hanukah man. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Instead of Santa Claus he was Hanukah man. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And he would knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and of course I didn’t know it was my father at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And this man would come in with a very stern voice and would say have you been good this time and of course both my sister and I said, trembling we said of course, yes, yes, we’ve been good children. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And he said well ok in that case I guess you deserve a gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And he would have this pillowcase over his shoulder and that’s how Santa Claus’ way and he’d imitate the Santa Claus cause I was impressed by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And so he was a Hanukah man so he had to imitate more or less the Catholics how they, the Christians how they handled things which was kind of cute. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And I only found out after I was a practically a teenager that was my father cause he never was there and I couldn’t figure out. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I mean he was there a couple of minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I’d go where did he go. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And then the bell rings and I didn’t put two and two together. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So it was really neat. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I really enjoyed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And I think that’s I’m trying to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">It is so, so much happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Did you wonder why you had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> and the other children, the Gentiles went to another <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Did your parents explain that to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  The same teachers taught my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And so naturally where the mother was taught I had to go and that was how, I never questioned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">It just seemed a natural thing that Miss Stantur was my mother’s teacher and she was, became my teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And of course she always compared me to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">My mother must have been, I was very timid though. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I really didn’t do things that most kids, I was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">But sometimes you know maybe I was quite as good as my mother used to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And she would tell my mother go to my mother and say, oh you know your daughter did this and this and this. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And I mean really I was my own person. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I couldn’t change me to my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">My mother was very lenient. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">My father on the other hand, he was very strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I mean if you didn’t throw the mark, I mean forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I mean he would, he was quick with the hand too. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And my goodness whenever he hit, he had big hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">I mean the man was over 200 pounds and yeah, I was a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">You know and my mother would threaten us every time when he would be out and she’d say I’m making notes. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">He will know all about what you’re doing so when he comes you will get punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And that was about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  What was important to them? </span><span class="sentence" id="332">What do you think they wanted you to understand that their values were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">ANSWER:  To be a good Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I mean (no sound)
QUESTION:  This is side two of the first tape of the interview with Margie Rosenthal. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We were talking about your parents values.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">ANSWER:  My mother was very lenient and she would get upset with us and she would warn me especially because I was the oldest that if I was not going to behave she was going to make notes and when dad would come back, then I would be punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And that scared me enough that from then on and I was a pretty good girl and we had a lot of fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I mean I can’t say that any of that was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But my grandmother spoiled me. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">I didn’t like, like for example on Friday afternoons for midday was our big meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And of course Shabbos was a big, big, big thing in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so during the noon hours we would have like maybe rice and cinnamon or something, a very light meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Well I didn’t like that at all, so my grandmother would make me a soup, chicken soup and put some things in there so I would have something warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And then came the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">I didn’t like the beef because I don’t care for boiled beef. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I never did, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Well maybe nowadays I might but not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So she would always have like a little squab or I should make a something that I would like, special vegetables, special this, special that and my parents didn’t really approve of that because this is just spoiling her. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And she said well she’s my one and only and she, I love her. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And my grandmother would, we were always doing things together. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">In fact our friends and relatives, everybody called us the bride and groom because we were always together. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Like I said my grandma and I had a wonderful relationship and when I had to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and leave her behind, that was really one of the hardest things I had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">I didn’t’ care so much about my aunt and uncle that were there who I loved dearly too but my grandmother and I had a wonderful relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">As a matter of fact, when my grandfather died, I moved into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So the two of us shared a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And at night she would have some chocolate and of course I had to have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And none of the others did but I got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So when I would go like during vacation, during say Easter vacation, Passover vacation, I would go to a girlfriend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boyden</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">That was oh not that far away but it was far enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">For me every distance was far actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And I would stay there for a few weeks and I would have to buy her always the same chocolates that she loved which was a coffee liquor filled chocolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And she loved those so whenever I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boyden</span> , I had a little money saved up. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I would buy that for her so I could bring it back to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And she appreciated it so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Well, that’s the least I could do for her goodness to me all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And, and then my cousin oh she was a little, she would, she did things like let me tell you what she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Like I told you, she ran away when we were always having a we didn’t have baby sitters in those days, so my auntie put her to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">But now let me tell you what happened at Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Just prior to Passover she was naughty so my aunt locked her into a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> I mean off the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I mean not for long. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">But all of a sudden she hears this crash bang and oh she’s like what has she done now. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So she opened up and my cousin Suzie had broken every egg that there was for Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">She had just gotten so upset that just kind of stomped on them or threw them about. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I don’t really know what she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">But she destroyed every egg. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So my auntie had to start from scratch. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And, oh go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">QUESTION:  You said something at the beginning of the interview about things changing in the <span class="REGION">area</span> where you lived in 1935 I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">As a child what filtered into your impressions of the changes that were happening and how did you see your parents dealing with it and your, I don’t’ know if you grandfather was dead then, but your grandmother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  My well it didn’t really, really come to my attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">However, my mother and my sister and I would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> to visit my great, my grandparents in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And one time when she went and then came back she got a letter that you have to come to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> , that you were carrying contraband. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And I said what in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I wouldn’t carry anything that wasn’t legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And apparently they had found a sausage that my mother had brought from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and that too wasn’t allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And so they had a, I mean we were scared that they would take her to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or something, that you know going to really punish her and thank the, thanks be to God. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Nothing really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">She was able to explain that it was a gift from my in-laws and that it was just a gift and that she hadn’t even bought it. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">With German money or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And that she didn’t’ have any contraband. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">She had no money that belonged to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">We knew better than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">So those are things that stuck in my mind that she was so upset and the whole family was upset when that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">But my girlfriends, nobody we didn’t we didn’t really have that big a problem with the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">it was just the government took my father to work in the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and my dad was coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> very, feeling not well. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">He was having pains. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I guess kidney, already then problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And for me, really nothing really, really happened that I could remember that was a difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything about Nazi propaganda on the radios for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Anything about book burnings say or newspapers and your parents talking about what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="400">ANSWER:  No I think they tried to shield us from all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">No, I, I don’t’ ever remember them saying much of anything and we still had our Jewish doctor that we went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">And until the time we left there was really no major problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">In fact one of my Christian girlfriends wanted to come to the <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> and my parents said better not. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">That’s how close we all were. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Cause there was really, like I said, I myself did not feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And they kept it from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">They did not want to share because this was very disturbing and they didn’t want to put us into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">My sister Eva, she was a very timid person. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">She was shy and but she loved to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Oh boy did she love to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And whenever we would go, we would go visiting people like friends of ours and they would put out the coffee and the cake. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">For the children special little goodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">She would say oh, she wouldn’t ask right out you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And before we left, my mother always gave us something to eat because she loved to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And I was a very poor eater as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And my, my food was they had to put it on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> with a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stool</span> and they would put a lot of butter on it because I didn’t, I wasn’t eating enough as far as they were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">So I hate the butter. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So they didn’t’, they didn’t give me a knife or anything So they always knew where I sat because I would take the butter off on the edge of the plate. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And I would go around like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">so that’s why I guess maybe my grandmother was spoiling me a little bit With the squab and all that stuff, veal cutlets and because I was a very poor eater. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Now not my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">We would go to these people and she had the full tummy. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And we would go there and she would just look at my mother and she said you know I haven’t had that in a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And of course the people would feel so sorry for her and they would say oh poor Eva. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Sure, help yourself, take something. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">It was so embarrassing for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">She would get so red in the face. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">She would say like I don’t feed her anything, but it wasn’t true at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">She just had a very good appetite. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And I was, going back to when I was saying, playing <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with them you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">My little cousin I told you 1s this little devious person. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I mean she was just, I mean she was always into things. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And all of a sudden my sister would start crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I said why are you crying, Eva, what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Suzie. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And I didn’t see anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">She said but she did and my cousin was so sneaky, Suzie. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">She was so sneaky, she would either drop something on the ground on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> or pretend that she’s picking it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">At the same time she’s pinching my foot or leg or something on my sister or behind my back. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I think it was really something. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">Keeping those two apart was a major, major problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">When I walked with them, I had to keep one on the left and one on the right, I mean at arm’s length. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I couldn’t even bring them together. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">But like I said my sister followed me everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Well one time we were a bunch of kids were playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Down in the we had meadows, very pretty meadows near, nearby and oh like across the <span class="DLF">street</span> and we lived in the newer portion of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">It was a lovely <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And we stepped <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and then there was this big meadow on both sides. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">So kids are you know they take, I learned how to throw knife. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Pocket knife. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">That’s a boys’ game but I played with everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Wasn’t just girls, it was boys too. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I was only maybe ten years old at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So I said to Eva I said why don’t’ you run and get me a knife so I can play also. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">So she runs up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and she comes back. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">While she’s running down, she falls and she cuts herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Oh my goodness. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Here she is bleeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I think that she’s dying because she’s crying like you know there’s no tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And of course again I had to take her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and again my grandmother said not her. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I mean we should have covered in something so she wouldn’t fall because she was carrying it and running. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But she was trying to do me a favor, the, my little sister so like I said it was of her I was in trouble more than for my own sake. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">But hey, that’s all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I mean she was five years younger than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I mean after all I was a big sister you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I had to really do whatever I was supposed to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">But sometimes I’d forget it and did what I, what any young kid would do. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">But it matured me. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I’d say that much it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And where, I don’t know now where.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  I was going to ask you how your parents decided on where you were going to emigrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">You mentioned the family in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> in fact sponsoring you. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">But of course you didn’t end up in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So why don’t you tell me what you remember about the circumstances of the choice being made to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> and how the other people around you, your family, the Jewish community reacted when you told them what you planned to do
ANSWER:  My father as you know was in the lumber business. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And when he asked, you know he asked around and nobody knew what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">So when he went to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> , <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> he asked where could I go and practice my profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They said well I don’t’ know but why don’t you try the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">It’s not a bad <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Why don’t’ you go there and then from there you can come to the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So with that in mind, jungles and all this when I heard jungles, oh boy my mind went wild. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I thought oh boy I could play with the monkeys. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I could play with the lions. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I could play with all, I was animal lover from way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">As a matter of fact, I used to walk a dog just to, to be near a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I loved animals from way when I was a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And the woman would be happy to give me her dog, the big German shepherd and I would play, but that was my protection and nobody could come near me. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So when they said <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span> I was all enthused. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I thought <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span> , great. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">You know I’Il be having the <span class="DLF">beach</span> right there and then I walk a few feet and I’d be living on the outskirts of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And my dad would go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Maybe he could bring me back a wild animal or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Well it didn’t quite turn out that way, but I didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">We didn’t even know where the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">All I knew was that you had to go over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> and that you had to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and so my parents tried to I guess maybe make it nicer than it really would have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And I don’t think they really had much of an idea either. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">All, All my dad knew he might have a good job over there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  Why don’t you tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I don’t think we discussed this. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">What kind of work exactly your father did. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">In the lumber industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="502">ANSWER:  My dad would go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and estimate the footage of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> to be cut. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">He had a wonderful mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">He never used to calculate it for anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">He could just but he didn’t need a calculator. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">His mind worked so well that all he looked at a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and he estimated and my goodness and that was how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I mean he was, he had a fabulous mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">And he knew that if he went into the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> he would go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span> , would go in and cut some, tell them how to cut the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and how much footage you’d get out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And with that in mind he decided we’ ll go to the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> and so there we would wait for our visa to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> and that would be wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Didn’t quite happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="511">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything or do you have a strong memory of what it was like when your father lost his job with the <span class="BUILDING">lumber company</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">What did you understand about why that happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  My parents wouldn’t tell us. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">Didn’t tell me at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">All they said, I guess they were afraid that if I made a remark to one of my Christian friends, they all had to somehow belong to the Nazi party or you know things like that, because in those days, when a boy reached a certain age, or a girl for that matter, they had to join the Junge, Jungefrau and, and it was like a Boy Scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">However, you’ve seen them in the movies and they had to join. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And it really could have been very, very hard on my parents if I said something so they really didn’t want to confide in us too much because if I, 1f any of us would have said something wrong that when we mentioned the fact that we were going to the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> , everybody said you’re crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Why the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Wait here til your visa comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">What’s your rush. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And my father said well I don’t like the way things are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="522"><span class="BUILDING">Stores</span> are already a little bit discriminating and I found that all out afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Nothing was told to us at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">But people all thought that he was out of his mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">So my aunt, my uncle, the whole family stayed behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">My grandmother didn’t want to leave because she had a pension from her husband being a locomotive engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">So she said why should I give up everything to go into a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that we know nothing about. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I mean if yeah, could I would say I go straight to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> that’s one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">But to go into a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="530">They did say <span class="REGION">tropics</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">They did say don’t bring any warm clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Just get light clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">So the dresses and all that was what we had was just light clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And they said that we could take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="535">But then we didn’t know also what to pack. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">My mother had visions of maybe she couldn’t get any soap so she brought boxes of the, like you have here Tide and all that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And she took that along. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And my dad was in those days we had a very musical family. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">My dad played the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">My mother played the piano and my aunt Ruth sang. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">So we always had a trio but I didn’t get to do any of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So when we talked about leaving, 1t was oh why, why, what is your rush you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Stay, a little longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And so my dad said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And he booked passage on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">French steamer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">That meant we had to go through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and but when they told us remember when we were in the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> and told us that we had to leave right then and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">We had the suitcases sealed and we said our goodbyes and we took off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">QUESTION:  Was it the <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> that suggested that you go to the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> as the sort of interim place to be on your way to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">ANSWER:  Yes it was because we went, we had an affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">However before we could even get the visa to the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> we had to put down like $500. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">That was a lot of money in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And that should see us through whatever comes in the next year or so that we would not be a burden to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">No other government. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And with that we were able to get the visa to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And that was how we finally got that and then we left on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And my mother started to cry and I thought you know that she’s just upset because she left her family there. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And which was very traumatic for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Because her sister and her were just very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">They were just a couple of years apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And so and my grandmother of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">So then we got past the as we get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strasbourg</span> , the German government, the officials come up and they said let’s open your suitcases. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">We want to see what you have in there and so my mother opened up the suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">They broke the seal rather and then she opened up and they kind of went through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And then they said everything is ok and close up again and go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And this was the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that left our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gleiwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">It was going all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Well after we passed into <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> my mother was very hysterical by this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">So I asked her, I said if you’re missing your sister so much, I can be your sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I’m old enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I’m 11 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And that made her cry even more. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">But then she told me that while they were sealing and she had forgotten to take the money out for the dresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And those German marks in the clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And if they had caught her, she would have been in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and they would have thrown away the key. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I mean that was going against every, everything so they just the customs was very strict in those days anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Especially the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Only let you take ten marks. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Well we’re supposed to live with ten marks, that’s 40 marks the four of us for this was in the early part of September and our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> didn’t leave until about, I think almost like three weeks later. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">So we went, the first time we came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , the cab driver took us, we said yes take us to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="580">He drove around and around and around. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">That was number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Charged an exorbitant amount. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Then he took us to this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">It was $50, dollars, 50 marks, whatever the currency to francs a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Well that depleted the money that we were able to take from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Thank god for the few dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Well pretty soon that money ran out too. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And we had to eat and of course we only stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">We went to another <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that about 3 or 4 stories up. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And they didn’t even have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">All you had to do in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">On each <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> they had one, one of those things where you kind of squat on a <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And the only <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> we had was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ground floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Well we had never seen anything like this or had even been close to something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">So it was, that part was really very traumatic for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">How, not to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I mean that was unheard of in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Anyway so here we were now without money. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And we didn’t want to be burdened with the Jewish HIAS or whoever Joint, whoever was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">So my mother somehow made mention in a letter to my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So she said go to this <span class="BUILDING">insane asylum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">There is the son of a friend of mine which, the mother always sends money to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And he will give you the money and I in turn will give her the money in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And that’s what we did but let me tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Going to the <span class="BUILDING">insane asylum</span> was a horrible feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">All these people that were either crying or singing and pretending to holding a baby and some came up to us and pulling us and didn’t’ want us to go and it was just that part was really very bothersome. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Then we talked to the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">He sounded as normal as anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">As you and I. well the reason he was in the <span class="BUILDING">insane asylum</span> was because he had taken a dip in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Seine</span> and he was naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">It was evening and he didn’t think anybody would see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Well lo and behold, they got him and they said anybody that does that has to go to the <span class="BUILDING">insane asylum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So that was where we got our money. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And then we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> for about ten days I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And but we didn’t go and eat all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I mean there was no way for us to go and eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">We couldn’t afford it. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">so we’d buy the bread and get some cheese and we’d eat upstairs in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> or whatever we rented.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">QUESTION:  Were you around other people, other Jews who were in the process of leaving Europe and how did your family find this <span class="BUILDING">rooming house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And were there other people staying there who were doing something similar to what you were doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="620">ANSWER:  No, these were French Jewish people that we met when we went to buy the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">This happened to be a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish bakery</span> or she just worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">AII I know is that my parents went to talk and she spoke German and so that kind of made a bond but the woman of course never offered us any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And then we asked where could we have a good dinner or lunch or something but we’d like a <span class="BUILDING">kosher restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">So she told us where to go for a <span class="BUILDING">kosher restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Other times we, it was a treat for us to go like a <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span> type thing, where you helped yourself and you could take your milk or whatever and for us that was something new. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">We never had anything like that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">SO we stood there like we didn’t know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">So the French people came up to us and we didn’t speak French of course which was another hardship, so we had to find always somebody that might be able with motions and things like that and I do remember one time though we had gone on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">We were going to go someplace and my father said we’re getting off at the next <span class="NPIP">stop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Well I was the first one at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and I jumped out and I look around. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">As I’m looking the <span class="DLF">doors</span> are closing and my parents are on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> still. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Well here’s this 11 year old kid, doesn’t know any word of French. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Doesn’t know where she exactly is but I thought well if I go up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and walk backwards, back over towards the other <span class="BUILDING">station</span> but of course I didn’t know which was way but I kind of had a hunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So I was pretty good with locations. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So I started walking and I see my mother and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">My mother was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Oh thank God we found you. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Thank God we got you back. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I said what’s the big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I knew I had to walk towards the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Yeah but how did you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I said what, I don’t know, I just knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">But anyway so that was quite an ordeal for everybody because they thought they’d lost me and I thought I’d lost them. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">What would I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="646">but as it turned out it was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">So you see, I’m a survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">From way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">QUESTION:  Which if your parents do you think you learned your survival skills from or your grandparents too I guess?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  I think my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">My dad had this he had really special qualities and whenever we would talk and we’d get a few times you know when he could sit down and talk to us, I think he was the most important influence on my maturing that quickly and also being having his ideas and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">But I don’t know whether it was really all of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">It might be my grandparents too I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">My grandmother was a very self-sufficient woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And she did all the how shall I say she did all the planning and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">She was the matron. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And she whatever she said everybody did. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">She was avery wise woman also. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">But I’m sorry to say she wasn’t wise enough to leave with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Which I had hoped she might do. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">But anyways so here we are now in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the time has come for us to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Well while we were in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> there were no other refugees like ourselves that we had met or seen or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">We couldn’t’ even go like I said we, Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">We spent Yom Kippur in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="666">But we couldn’t’ even get to a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Then I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">That part I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">But anyway everything was kind of a new, new thing to me so we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">We checked into somebody must have told us which <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> to check into and we had to wait three days for our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessel</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to come and was the President Dorme. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">While we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> , we met this young, very young couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">They had just gotten married before they left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> all by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">So this lady looked up to my mother as her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And she asked my mother a lot of questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">How do you do this and what do you do with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">So my mother has kind of reared her you might say because she was so lost the poor thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">She had, she didn’t know anything and her name was Margot Friedlander. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And his name was Heinrich Friedlander. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Well anyway so we get finally, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> arrives. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">And it was a great big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Of course to us kids who had never seen a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamer</span> , never seen anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">We come from a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , as I mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And oh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , I saw my first black people. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I had never seen anybody but white people because there were, we were too far away from everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> there were a number of other nationalities . </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And when we finally got on board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , we realized oh there are more children. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">There was one was Margot Kassel and Biata Zuskind and Biata was a smaller child. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And my sister was going to have a birthday on that trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">It would have been October the 19". </span><span class="sentence" id="690">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">so my mother bought a cake for her at one of the <span class="BUILDING">bakeries</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseille</span> and very, didn’t show it to my sister, cause it was only next <span class="DLF">port</span> would be <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Said</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And her birthday was on the day of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Said</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">That we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Said</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Well I think that’s three days away, board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> the 16". </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And while going down the gangplank into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Said</span> , all these beggars (end file 1) (file 2 — RG-50.106.0052.02.03 — duration: 01:03:21)
QUESTION:  This is the taped interview made for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">The interview is with Margie Rosenthal. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">I’m the interviewer Nancy Alper. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">It’s October 24" 1996. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">This is the second tape, side A. Now Margie we were talking about your mother’s attempts to have a birthday celebration on board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Kong</span> for your sister Eva.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  Well my sister being very generous at all times, my mother presented her the cake on board and we were going to have it for dessert. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Well we come across this beggar on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">My sister turns around, runs back up onto board. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">We didn’t know why she was running back and we called her and she was already up the gangplank and already gone, comes back with the cake. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">She’s giving it to the beggar. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And my mother just having fits. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">She just said this was your cake Eva, what are you giving away? </span><span class="sentence" id="707">That poor man has nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">So my mother, what did she do. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">She took some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Gave the money to the beggar and took the cake back which we had after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">But that’s how Eva is. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">She will take off her shirt and give it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Very, very soft hearted person. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Anyway so on board <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> we met a lot of other refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Like I said Margot Kassel was my sister’s age and Bi, Biata Zuskind she was a younger, she was about maybe three years old at that time, two or three years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And things were pretty good but I don’t like, I didn’t know any French food. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And for me to start eating French food when I’m used to the regular <span class="INT_SPACE">kosher German kitchen</span> , you know was quite a change. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">So I said and I did say something to my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I don’t remember exactly what, but he said my reply was well I’m going to write to my grandmother because she will have to know how I am treated on here. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">You are treating me not well at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I told my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Uh oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">That was the wrong thing to say, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">So he said you just dare do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Make a heart more heavy than she already has. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I mean the poor woman has just lost a daughter, her granddaughter, granddaughters and now you want to write a letter and tell her how miserable things are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">You better not. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Well he was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Of course, I didn’t but needless to say I would never have hurt my grandmother in any, any kind of a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">so I had to adjust to the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">But you know I missed my tomatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Oh I love tomatoes and pickles and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">So there was one gentleman that was in the, working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and I mentioned it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">They all spoke some German. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And I told him that I really missed having a fresh tomato. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Guess what. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">At dinner he brought me a fresh tomato. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">That was the best meal I can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And every meal we had wine as well but of course children never drank the wine but the food was so different than what I had known that it took quite an adjustment and then we went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Port Said</span> , we went over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Porti</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Oh, <span class="DLF">Suez Canal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Let me not forget the <span class="DLF">Suez Canal</span> which was a very exciting experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">You could see across the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and you could see <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I mean <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , I would say more like <span class="BUILDING">pyramids</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And you see the Arabs and I mean it was so close. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">It was just a very thrilling experience and dad said you’d better remember this very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">This may be your last time you’re going to go through <span class="DLF">Suez Canal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">This is something that is very, very important for you to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">So we really stayed on board and looked at everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And then we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Djibouti</span> and somebody wanted to buy my sister from my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">They said oh she is so cute. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">My sister had blond hair, blue eyes and curly hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I mean she was very adorable. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And they, the woman wouldn’t give up. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">She wanted to buy my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">My sister said no, she’s not for sale. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And then so then we were afraid that she was going to take her SO we were always around her. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I mean it was like until we left, you know we had to watch her every second because we really thought that she might kidnap her or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Singapore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="759"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Singapore</span> was just beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">It was absolutely lovely. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">But hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">It was so hot and we just came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we are in autumn already in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And we come over there and it was, I mean we were not used to the heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">But anyway we did take a walk and strolled in a little bit on the <span class="DLF">pier</span> and then it was too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And we had to turn back to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">So we never really got to see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Singapore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And then from there my next recollection was getting to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saigon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saigon</span> my dad bought himself a beautiful one of those tropical helmet type things and he looked really chic and he wore that on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saigon</span> we stayed there two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">We had French legionnaires on board. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And these poor guys didn’t have wine or anything so the men at our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> took the wine from our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and took it over there to these guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And they were so happy to have something that like wine for the French. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">You know how that, it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">So they were so happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">But before I even get that far. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Let me say something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">For days, there were, the people, the officers on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> said “Keep an eye on the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="779">We have a <span class="DLF">line</span> out. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">We hope to catch a whale.” </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Oh boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">With us kids, we were always checking the <span class="DLF">line</span> that was hanging out of the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And we’d see it trailing you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">But nothing is happening, nothing is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">One day finally there was a big thing, intercom and attention, attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">We caught whale. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I want most, everybody on board, children first. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Let them see the whale. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Before we cut the whale open. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So oh boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I mean we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lounge</span> as a matter of fact, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">ladies lounge</span> , washing our hands and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And we run upstairs to the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> where the <span class="DLF">line</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And there was this long fish, dripping water still, black fish, very impressive, big huge thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And they said well now all the girls, all the kids are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">There weren’t that many children on board because this was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luxury liner</span> really and was dropping off the legionnaires to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saigon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And so it was very, very exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">So we all rushed up there and were standing with bated breath. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Now they’re going to cut the fish open, going to see what’s <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the fish. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And the captain come out and has this big knife and he cuts it open. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And you know what falls out. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Candies. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Oh it was, we had crossed I guess the dateline. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">I am not sure what exactly what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">But it was so thrilling. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">All these candies fell out and they were green and different colors, mainly green that represent the eggs I guess in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">whale</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">But it was so funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And, oh he said take all the candy you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Of course, we kids, candy. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">We all grabbed hands full and then of course there were other passengers took it too. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">So this is one of my very memorable experiences we had on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="812">Other than that I mean that was really nothing much happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">QUESTION:  I think you had told me that your parents had pre-paid for the entire trip while you were still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="814">It was a kind of package. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Why don’t you tell me a little bit about that and how if you know anything, how they knew how to go about doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And another question was how many immigrants and refugees there were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="817">From other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> besides <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and doing something similar to what you were doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">ANSWER:  No the only people were from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they were the only refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And like I said there was only this one young family. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">And this one family with the daughter Margot and the one with Zuskind. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">That was the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">That I believe was all there was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , as far as Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And the other ones, I don’t, there were French people going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Singapore</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saigon</span> , really not a whole lot of people but we only knew about ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And I did not mention this but the men slept separately from the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">So we had in our <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> was this young woman that was just married, my mother and my sister and I, four of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And in dad’s <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> there were also four men. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">So they had for some reason, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I guess they didn’t have the facilities to accommodate us because we were the refugees but we did pay for the passage already in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And I believe the HIAS was helping us. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">But I’m not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I never did question them how, when and where and what. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">All I know is that we had the money that we had to put down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> and vouch that we would never be a burden to any government.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="833">QUESTION:  Also I wanted to ask you, did you have a German passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Do you remember that? </span><span class="sentence" id="835">When you left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="836">ANSWER:  We did and it all over Juden ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And by that time we were stateless. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">We did not have any more a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so we were considered stateless. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Singapore</span> , my sister and were always on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> looking around and you know kids, there was nothing more for us to do really. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">There were no movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">If there were, they would have been in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">We would never have understood anyways, so us children kind of had to devise our own games and _ talk and do things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">So I was looking into the hold of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , I see that our box that we had our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> in, our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="844">I would say like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and soap that my mother was bringing along and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Oh, the few goblets of crystal. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">I mean painstakingly wrapped. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">It was a big wooden box, they called them lifts in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And that had broken open. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And with all of those natives there, I was so afraid they were going to take it all and we wouldn’t have anything left when we got to the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">So I told my sister, I said you watch while I go run and find dad so he can get ahold of the captain to make sure that they get it covered up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Or nail it together, whatever it takes. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">Cause I don’t’ want to lose all our stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">So she was standing on top there looking down. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And I found my father pretty soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And I said come quick, come quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">Look what’s happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">So he ran and got the captain and they went down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hold</span> and they were able to get our stuff together. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">But that is how we reached the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">The soap had spilled out onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="860">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> had rusted away. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">So by that time we really didn’t have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="862">We didn’t’ have much of soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">I mean a lot of stuff was ruined regardless you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">But anyways so that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saigon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And on the way from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saigon</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Kong</span> came the typhoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Everybody was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Everybody was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">We couldn’t go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And oh my dad’s hat flew away that he just so painstakingly bought in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saigon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Went overboard and it was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">He was more upset about that than I think anything else because it was such a nice helmet type thing that they wore in the <span class="REGION">Orient</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Anyway so we were too sick to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">But my dad was at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I mean we could never understand how could you eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">We were so sick that the doctor had to give us medications because we couldn’t hold food down and we couldn’t eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I mean it was horrible and I mean, all the passengers were sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Except my dad and this young guy that had just gotten married. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">The two of them had the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> to themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And they had all the food they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And they had to put the plates into containers which were bolted to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Otherwise they would be sliding this way and sliding that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">But we finally made it into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kowloon</span> which is <span class="REGION">Hong Kong China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="883">But we had to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kowloon</span> because that’s where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> docked. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">Now we needed shots in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kowloon</span> because we didn’t get the malaria and, and that, whatever the tropical diseases were. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">So we had to go to this Chinese doctor who had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="886">The <span class="DLF">staircase</span> was so narrow and so dark that we could hardly see where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Well my imagination was oh my god he’s going to abduct us and we’re not going to go get anywhere and we’re going to be sold as slaves or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Like I said I had a very vivid imagination. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And we made it up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">Got our shots, came back down and we were all kind of (sniffs) like this you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">We were kind of crying cause it was hurting. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And my dad said all right, I had a, I couldn’t take my big doll from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> but I was able to take the smaller version. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">And I loved that doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">Of course I had to name her Suzie also, naturally because I left my Suzie one in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so this was also Suzie. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">So he said how about we buy Suzie a dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">Well that was a big deal so I went with him to, with my parents into this beautiful <span class="BUILDING">store</span> that had all embroidered things. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And I said I showed them the doll and they said we’ve got the thing for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">They gave me this beautiful dress for my doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">Oh it was absolutely gorgeous. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">All kinds of embroidery and all it was so pretty. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">So now I had a dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And we stayed in a very pretty <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Kong</span> and the food, I guess I had gotten used to eating almost anything because if you’re hungry you’|l have to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And so I did eat French. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Now I was going to experience Chinese food. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">Which was again something different, but noodles I liked so that was ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">We ate a lot of noodles. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">And we did take a trip also over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Kong</span> which is by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry boat</span> which was kind of exciting for us as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">So we were a few days in, I can’t remember exactly the how many days we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hong Kong</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="909">But then we were on our way to the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> on a not with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger ship</span> which I thought we would have. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">We had to leave the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and go on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freighter</span> , a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freighter</span> and there we were all in one <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">But my dad always liked to have the round <span class="DLF">window</span> , the portholes opened because he liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">So while dad was there and he had his mouth open one of us kids, I guess probably it was me, took a raisin and threw it in his mouth and he thought it was a fly. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And he started coughing and screaming and yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I swallowed a fly, I swallowed a fly. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">But then we laughed and he says what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">What did you guys do. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And you know how kids do pranks like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">So we told him, it was only a raisin. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Well the next day he was sleeping again, the <span class="DLF">window</span> open again. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">This time a big wave came and he thought we’re drowning. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">He’s screaming we’re drowning, we’re drowning. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Why don’t we all jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">You know he thought for sure we were drowning. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">As it was, a wave had come into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabin</span> on top of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And all he could he was breathing. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">I mean he had been sleeping and all of a sudden he was like d, you know being drenched with this ocean water. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And so that was another experience that we won’t forget, because he thought for sure we were drowning. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Well anyway we make it finally to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> and we
QUESTION:  How long did the trip take all together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="930">ANSWER:  Hmm. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Mmm. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Ok we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> around the, I would say the 16" yeah, 16" of October and we did not get the, between all that, we did not get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> til the 16", no, 14 of November. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I did forget to mention something and now it came at just now I had a loss of memory again but it'll get back to me, ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And we were met at the <span class="DLF">docks</span> by the Jewish committee and they took us to a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in the walled <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="935">The walled <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> is called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Intramuros</span> and that is a very old. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">That was because of the Spaniards and the Spanish were occupying <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="937">That was a <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> and so this time you know it was very exciting to be living in something like that and, but they warned us don’t leave any food out. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Because of the rats that go around these old <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Oh my gosh. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Now we are afraid of rats as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">I mean I love animals, but I don’t’ think Id like rats. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">So we would take food upstairs but have to wrap it in linen napkin, very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">And they still got to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">So we still all the food we brought upstairs was eaten you know nibbled on during the night by these stupid rats. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And we only stayed there like 3 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">And then the Jewish committee said we'll give, tell you where you can go and rent something. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">So we rented the upstairs of a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Downstairs was a Filipino dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And upstairs was for us refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">My parents, other people I don’t even remember their names very well but every <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was occupied by a different family. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And one, then we had a single bachelor and he had to sleep <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> because we just ran out of <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="952">And this man gets up the next morning and he says he yelled at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">He says you kids are playing tricks on me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Apparently somebody played a trick on him on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> where he came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And we don’t know which <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> he came on because there were quite a few refugees at that time, already. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Anyhow so he accused us of taking his pants and hiding them. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Well we didn’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">so everybody started looking for his pants because he said, how I can’t even get out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">So finally somebody looked down. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">AII the <span class="DLF">windows</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> had bars by the way because a lot of robberies took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">So we looked down and sure enough on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> were his pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And so we kids went and got them. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And how in the world did they do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">We asked the dentist downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Oh he said easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">They are on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , which is a ways away but same level as your upstairs, up, <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> is and he said they just take a fishhook, <span class="DLF">fish line</span> , hook the pants bring them out, take the money and leave the pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">That’s exactly what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">They took all of his money. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">They took his papers and everything else but they left his pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">So that was our one experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">QUESTION:  You had mentioned being excited about going to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And I was wondering what your earliest impressions were of what the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> were like compared to what you had been thinking it was going to be like and how it compared to your experience in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="973">ANSWER:  A far cry from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , a very far cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">There were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">palm trees</span> , all right with coconuts on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And the Filipinos would climb up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and throw down the coconuts for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And we could crack them open, but first they had a green hull around them which had to be stripped, but they all carried knives, bolos, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And so like hatchet, big hatchet things. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Oh very vicious looking deals. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And that’s what they used to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">But I could not see any <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I mean these were paved <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="982">These were <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And I thought well maybe when we move further in, you know away from the <span class="REGION">city area</span> , I might find the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">jungle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Well it didn’t quite happen that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">We only stayed in there one month because that was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for us, when they can hook something and take things out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">That was not for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">So then again we have asked the Jewish committee, where we could go and where we could live. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">So they said well there is a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="989">Il show you but you have to share it with another family. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">Well no problem, I mean, that’s fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">So we met the Kostenits family, a husband, wife and one daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">The daughter was just a couple of years older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And so that was a beautiful complex. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">It was, it belonged to I think a mayor, Resal. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">His last name was Resal. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">I don’t remember his first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">But there are a lot of Resals over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">There are lot, it’s a very popular name. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was very beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">It had, downstairs was a <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Cause it was like a <span class="INT_SPACE">dance hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Oh it was huge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And then you went up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and upstairs were the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> — the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , three <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">One was occupied by my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">One was occupied by the girl, Eva. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">Kostenits parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was for us three girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">And it also had a very long <span class="INT_SPACE">veranda</span> out front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">The length of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Of course, also it had bars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">Downstairs, upstairs and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">The only bar that wasn’t on was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> because they felt I guess there wasn’t much to steal in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">So anyway SO we moved in with what we had, not a whole lot because like I said the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> was already ruined from the ocean water and everything else so I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">My dad wasn’t able to clean it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">There was just no way of rescuing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">My mother’s soap became like soap suds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">There was hardly anything left of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">But we did have a few clothes that we had brought along and we were able to use them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">But since we knew that this was going to be temporary because it was for two people, we wanted something for ourselves and they wanted something for themselves as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">But what happened is which made us move even faster, was we were sleeping one night and I was awoken by a man putting his arms around my neck and putting his face next to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And I woke up and I yelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">A boy wants to kiss me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">I like I said my imagination, I have very vivid imagination. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">At this time, by that time I was 12 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">My birthday was in July and you know time passes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">so this was July and I was 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And but back to this robber. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">He was taking a check on what I was wearing and he had been already to somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">I don’t remember now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">It was my sister or the other gal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">both were named Eva so I didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And so this lady next door in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> said oh go to sleep you had a, you had a dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">You just, go back to sleep, go back to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">I said no he’s creeping out now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">He’s leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">He’s leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">Catch him, somebody stop him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And so my parents, by my voice could tell immediately that something was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">So my mom got up and of course she saw the <span class="DLF">window</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> wide open. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">The <span class="DLF">door</span> to the, from the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> going down was wide open, things scattered all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">And my dad had a very bad habit, of taking his rings off at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">Wedding ring and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">Well that was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">The wedding ring was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">The watch was gone and that he was very upset about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">And then we had some eau de cologne that we had brought from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">It had a gold cap on it, sort of gold metal thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">They took that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">They thought that was the real thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">So what over a period of time, I mean this is how we lost some things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">You know robberies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">So he took quite a few things with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">He took we had brought coral necklaces, my sister and I. Those he took. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Oh a few odds and ends, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">At this time I don’t’ even remember what all the man did take, but he was so deft at it that he had gone to this one, and nobody, he was in my parents’ <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and they didn’t even feel his presence or hear him or that is so very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">If he hadn’t touched me I might not have woke up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">But he made the mistake of touching me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">With that I woke up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And they said had he had I worn earrings he would have probably been able to take them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">I would not have felt it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And the necklace the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">He, they do it in one, one grab, feeling for necklace and earrings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And being I’m a light sleeper, that he was able to take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Not, I mean not get to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">Then we called, I guess I didn’t call, we didn’t call the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">We had no phone of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Somebody heard us and commotion and so the people next door that lived there came over and asked what went on and we told them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">And so I see this Filipino man coming up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and I’m yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">I said “that’s him, that’s him”. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">At night it you know this is night time we’re talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">He had on white t-shirt and white shorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">So did this man that was creeping out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that had touched me and he too had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">So I said “that’s him, that’s him”. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">And they kept saying “no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">No, he’s our houseboy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">I said “that’s the man, I saw him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">But of course it wasn’t him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">But I was so hysterical at that point that, and then of course I was afraid to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">They had to look under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , they had to look everywhere before I would even go to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">I mean I was just so afraid of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">By then and to this day, I am still. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">I mean this wasn’t the only robbery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">I'll get to that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">But to this very day I don’t trust anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">When I had a dog in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">We lost our dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">Now I have ADT which 1s a security system installed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And my husband can’t understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">He’s from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">But me, I am from the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">And we had so many robberies that I am paranoid about things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">Anyway, so that was one of the experiences with the robbery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">The very first one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">Then these people moved out and they moved across to the next <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">And then we took another family in because nobody could afford to pay that kind of rent and my dad still didn’t have a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">So they kept saying “you'll find one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">Don’t worry, you'll find one.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">But I went, enrolled as we had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">I mean we can’t do without <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">So my parents enrolled us into a <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> run by the German nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">They figured because German nuns would be helpful in learning, then we could learn to speak English better than we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">So they put me into fourth grade and my sister was very young so she went into first grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Well, after a while they realized that I’m not, I’m too far ahead because I you know I had already been in the fifth grade in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">So they put me into fourth first and then they put me into fifth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">So that’s what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">Into fourth grade first and then into the fifth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">Then before I knew it we were kicked out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">My mother was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Come to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">We want to talk to all the parents were called one by one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And the head, the Mother Superior said to my family, my mother, sorry you have to take your children out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">My mother said, why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">Well because you’re Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">My mother said because we’re Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">We just left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> bruise we were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Well, we’re being persecuted here too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">Why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1119">QUESTION:  This is side 2, Side B of the second tape, the interview with Margie Rosenthal for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, by Nancy Alper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">The date is October 24, 1996. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And Margie you and I before I turned the machine on were just talking about your hearing on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">board ship</span> , on your way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> , about the happening of Kristallnacht in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1122">ANSWER:  We heard that the <span class="BUILDING">temples</span> had been burned and that there was a big closings of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> of the Jewish merchants and that must have come in over the radio to the operator on board <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And he passed it along to the refugees that were on board. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">So we knew how close my dad had gotten to not even getting us out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And that was a very fortunate thing for us that we made it out before all this took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">Oh, they were arresting all the Jewish people but the men especially the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And taking them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And my uncle, my aunt Ruth’s husband, Herbert Binger was one of the first that they took to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And he was there so that’s how we had heard only through letters, that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> by the time we reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And I also forgot to mention the fact that when we got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> , there was a girl that had a cousin waiting on her at the <span class="DLF">pier</span> or the <span class="DLF">docks</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And she said to her cousin, she said “Hey” she said “who’s that Chinese lady that, that Chinese girl that’s there with you that came off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">She is Chinese.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">And my girlfriend said “Oh no, she’s one of us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And I was so devastated when I heard that, I had never forgotten that ever since. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">It’s been bothering me and I told her about that, the last day that we were here together at the reunion but I’m getting ahead of myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Now back to our moving around to the <span class="BUILDING">Santa Escolastica school</span> and going to classes over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">And the boy that had, we had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because this little boy that was in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , he apparently had either stomped on the picture of Jesus or spit on it or both. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">I’m not exactly sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">But the Mother Superior told my mother that she has to take us out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because we cannot expect, she said “we cannot expect Jewish children to come and study at the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">We wouldn’t go to your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">So my mother said “well we don’t have a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">There are just a handful of Jewish children here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">She said, “Well then it’s time you opened one up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And with that my mother was so upset that she said “yes, ok”. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">So all of the kids that were in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">There weren’t all that many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">But there were a number of the refugees that were there and we had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">But while I was in classes over there, the children all made fun of my English because my English was the Oxford English and if I said something like looking glass or either or neither, they just would laugh and that would really embarrass me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And then another thing that happened is there are So many cats over there and somehow, I didn’t know yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">I learned later on that you had to be very careful where you stepped because if you stepped into some cat do, you would get that horrible smell on you and the whole class would smell badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">And somebody would say “hm, I smell something horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">Margie, did you step into something.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">And you know what, I really was the one that did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">So they’d send me out of the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">I had to clean my shoes off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">The bottom and wherever I stepped into it and then I could return to the class. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">But I still had a few very ugly experiences over in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santa Escolastica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">So when they told us we had to leave I really wasn’t all that sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">To me, that was kind of a new page in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">I was going on from this bad experience with the German sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">So we moved, this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pasay</span> where we were living in that big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and that where we shared with so many people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1162">QUESTION:  You weren’t in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Intramuros</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">Is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pasay</span> a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1164">ANSWER:  Yeah, by the way yeah, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pasay</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pasay</span> had also the Jewish committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">I think they were located either very close to it or I’m not sure exactly where. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">But they told my dad that he should use his money up first and not to worry about a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">It’ll come, it’1l come and my dad said “yeah but I don’t’ want to use everything up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">We’ll have nothing to live on anymore.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And they said “oh, it’s all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">You’ll find work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">You’ll find.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">So it was over a year later that my dad finally did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">But not until we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ermita</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">But I do want to say one more thing what happened to me while we were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pasay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">We had this one lady that had a baby and her husband, they were living with us at that time in the big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">And she asked my mother if I could go and get her some sanitary napkins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">So my mother said yeah she should go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">So she gave me some one and she said “why don’t you go to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , over” which was not all that far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">And she said “go and get me a box of sanitary napkins”. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">And I went ahead and I was about 12 years old at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">And I went over there and I said “I want a box of sanitary napkins”. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And this Chinese merchant said to me, he says do you know what they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And I says “Of course,” I said “it’s a napkin that you wipe your mouth with when you are done’. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">Well they all were laughing like crazy and I couldn’t understand why they are laughing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">To me it was a very serious matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">So when I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I told my mother, I said “you know they were laughing but when I, they asked me if I knew what a sanitary napkin was and I didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">All I said is well it’s something that you have to use when you eat your lunch or dinner and you wipe your mouth and to be you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">Etiquette, it reminds you to have a napkin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And they roared, they absolutely roared.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">And she said “oh my goodness”. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">She said you don’t know really, do you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">I said “what should I know”. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">And she said “Well that’s when you get your period.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Well I was so embarrassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">From that moment on, when I had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> I went across the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I passed them so I wouldn’t have to look at them or go near them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">It was the most embarrassing moment of my life, I think at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">It was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Anyway, from like I said from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pasay</span> we did finally move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ermita</span> because first of all there were no jobs to be had over where we were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pasay</span> and there was a nice <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with American nuns and I think really that was the main reason that my parents moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ermita</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">There were many other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> they could have gone to, suburbs of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> that they could have gone to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">But that so we went over to meet the sisters of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maryknoll</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">And they were so wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">They opened their arms, took us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">We had to pay which we did too at <span class="BUILDING">Santa Escolastica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">Nothing is for free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">We even had to buy uniforms at <span class="BUILDING">Santa Escolastica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">And now we had to buy uniforms again in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Maryknoll</span> , at or <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">But Maryknoll college uniform was very pretty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">It was a wine red full skirt with bib like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And underneath you had a beige blouse, short sleeves and it had a wine red ribbon around the collar which was very pretty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">It was kind of a pleated top and down to the waist and then again pleat from the waist down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">And we really loved the sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">It was so wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And being we were Jewish we were not required to take religious lessons as we had to do in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santa Escolastica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">We had to attend all the lessons, but over there they gave me the freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">If I wanted to, I could sit in the back of the class and just listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">Well I thought that was very interesting for me was the history so I just sat there and listened to all the teachings of Jesus Christ and the parables and all the things that happened and saints and what have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">And then it came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Oh before I go on, I was put into the sixth grade right then and there because I was in fifth grade at <span class="BUILDING">Santa Escolastica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">And they thought that I would fit very well into the sixth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">So I was in the sixth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And they had a test, an examination at the end of the school year and they said would you like to take the examination on, on the religious part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">I said sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">What have I to lose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">I mean after all you know I’m not supposed to be here but I’Il take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">And believe it or not I was on the honor roll, the second person on the honor, I did better than the Catholics did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">And the sisters told it all over the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">Can you imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">We have a Jewish girl and she got a 98% whereas you kids don’t even get anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">You are barely passing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And so I was really thrilled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">And then came the seventh grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">And again I was on the honor roll and again I was on the top in fact this time I was on the first on the honor roll. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">I was number one which made me very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">And it pleased them immensely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">Then we graduated from the seventh grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">Well that is a big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">The archbishop has to come in and he has to bless the children and you had to have special uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">White dress and I, well my mother really couldn’t afford to buy a white dress so one of the classmates of mine said oh her sister already graduated and I could fit into her dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">And that’s what happened and I had to go forward and kiss the ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">I pretended to kiss it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">I didn’t really kiss, I didn’t think 1t was sanitary enough to kiss the ring, but I did and from then on I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">And in the first year of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , I learned Latin and that was a very difficult language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">And then the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And that was the end of it for my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1247">QUESTION:  Where did you go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1248">ANSWER:  The very same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1249"><span class="BUILDING">Maryknoll College</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">They also had a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">And at that point I was, let’s see 14 years old, 14 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">It was 1941 and I’m trying to get the figures in my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">Anyhow, anyway I didn’t not even complete the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , the first year of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> because the war did break out in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1254">QUESTION:  Before we get to that part of what you went through because it was so different and involving, what was your experience with the Jewish community or your association with the Jewish community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> between your arrival at the end of 1938 and say the bombing of Pearl Harbor in December of 1941.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1255">ANSWER:  We had by that time, we had joined the congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">The <span class="BUILDING">Temple Emil</span> and we had a wonderful person that was I think he wasn’t really a rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">He was the father of Rebecca Konigsberg because her father was very well educated in the Jewish religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">And he knew all the customs so he was leading the congregation there for a number of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">And we went to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">We took Hebrew lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">We, we learned a lot in that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">And even through all the war years, we still were going to that <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> until the very end of the occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">But let me not get ahead of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">We moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ermita</span> and we had to share again a lower flat like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">It had several <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> and we rented it in the beginning, we rented it to American businessmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Then they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">Then we rented it to an American woman with a child and the man was in the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">And then they were evacuated because they knew that something was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">People had an inkling that war was not far away but nobody really talked about it, that this was in 1940 I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">And then white Russians moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">After they all had left, so we had quite a turn over, over there, but we always were able to rent it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">And before all this, I do want to say something really cute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">We had a black cat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">And this cat was like a little dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">It would know exactly when we would come from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , at lunch time and would sit at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">And it was adorable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">That cat was just like a, like a little, it was like, but like a cat, it wasn’t, wasn’t a cat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">It was like a dog I want to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">And then my mother saw a black cat one day out while she was shopping for groceries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">And she said “my goodness, that looks like our cat Peter”. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">So she was feeding this cat Peter all the way to the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and guess what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">There was our cat in the <span class="DLF">window</span> sitting and looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">So she had fed this strange black cat who was very happy to receive the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">That was one of the funny experiences we had during that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">Anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1286">QUESTION:  I forgot to ask you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">Do you remember approximately when your father got the job with the Ford motor company and what that did to your life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1288">ANSWER:  My dad got the job after one year, which was 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">He did get a job with Ford Motors as a purchasing agent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">And he had to drive the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> around and pick up parts and things like that and he really loved the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">It was very nice and he really enjoyed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">And we were very happy to finally have you know some extra money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">And in the meanwhile, we got a word that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> , in, I’m sorry in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> an uncle who had been coming over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> and we couldn’t keep him there, had gone on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">Had pneumonia and passed away and left my aunt with a six year old daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">That was in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">The same age as my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">So it was a very trying experience for her so we were able to send her money so she would have something to live on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">And then came the news that my grandmother was still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">So again we had to send some money and to, into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and my grandmother got the very last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , over <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1300">QUESTION:  Now when you say your grandmother you’re talking about Anna Zusman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1301">ANSWER:  Yes, yes it was Anna Zusman that was my grandmother that was left behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">The other ones I, like I said I don’t even know you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">I knew they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">That’s the last, we had said our goodbyes over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">And my grandmother in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , she by that time everybody had to wear the Star of David on their, the yellow star of David, or an arm band. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">They had to be identified as Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">And when friends that she had before wouldn’t’ even talk to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">That they ran across the <span class="DLF">street</span> or just to get out of the way so they wouldn’t have to greet her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">And so
QUESTION:  this is probably a good time for me to ask you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">You mentioned there were letters waiting for you when you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And although you knew about Kristallnacht from on board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , I assume you learned more things from the correspondence that you had waiting for you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">I wanted to ask you about that correspondence and whether you were able to continue receiving mail after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1313">ANSWER:  Yes we did letters, get letters from my aunt and my grandmothers stating the fact that my uncle now was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and he has to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">Out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because that’s the only way he could get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">Now my uncle had already years ago had TV. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">He was so he had weak lungs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">So when he went into we tried to keep him <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">We tried everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">We went to the HIAS, we went to the Jewish committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">We tried every which way and there was absolutely no way they could, we could keep them over there which was very disturbing to us because we had hoped that they could stay with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">And as fate would have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and that’s the only place my grandmother, Anna Zusman could go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">So perhaps this was the way fate played it on us, that she was saved that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">And she died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> at, of old age but my aunt said that also she had stomach cancer and nobody wanted to really talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">And thinking now about the going back to the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">I’m trying to remember in sequence how things were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ermita</span> , when we found out that the war was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">My dad of course was still working on the <span class="DLF">pier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">And then the Japanese started bombing us very, very heavily. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">And there was no difference between military objects or private people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">It just didn’t’ matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">And we could always tell when you saw them in morning, early high up above at around 8:00, that would mean they would bomb us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">If they weren’t there at 8:00 that day they would not bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">SO this was from December the eighth until oh, into I think it was like February when they finally decided to invade us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">And my dad was working like I say on the <span class="DLF">docks</span> and they’re bombing all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">And then the Americans had to set fire to all of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> ’ cargo and everything that was on the <span class="DLF">docks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">They didn’t want to leave anything to the Japanese of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">So the people were told, take whatever you can carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> are open to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">The <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> are open to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">Grab whatever you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">Make as many trips as you can and get all the food or whatever you feel like you’re going to grab and if you can make several trips go for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">So people would pass our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with, carrying things like clothing and just materials so my mother bought a couple of materials from these people and we bought potatoes because potatoes did not grow in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">They had to be imported. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">So and we were used to eating potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">So then my dad got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> from the company and they said take whatever you can take. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">So he just took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and a few odds and ends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">But no, not a whole lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">We’re not, he wasn’t the kind of person to just take. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">But we did get a few things from the people that were dragging it and then they could go back and get more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">This way they had money and at the same time were able to get some groceries or foods, I mean clothing and whatever else we could possibly use. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">One thing we heard about and that was kind of a strange situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">These people, there were four of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">And they were carrying this, they saw this huge heavy box. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">And they figured there must be something wonderful in that box. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">So the four, four people are carrying it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">And they took it all the way down to, into our <span class="REGION">area</span> and along the <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">It was called <span class="DLF">Dewey Boulevard</span> , it was a beautiful, it wasn’t a <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">First it was a <span class="DLF">street</span> and then there was a <span class="DLF">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">That this was <span class="DLF">Dewey Boulevard</span> with a <span class="DLF">street</span> that they were walking on and dragging things and pulling and whatever they could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">And finally got far enough from the fire and opened it up and inside was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coffin</span> with a dead person who was on his way to wherever they were going next to be buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">Well needless to say that was the end of that, never got to go to his <span class="NPIP">resting place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">And then the fire was going a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">I mean it was all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">They were trying to burn as much as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">But they did not burn <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">1t was just at the <span class="DLF">pier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">And then pretty soon the Japanese started marching in and the Americans had already left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bataan</span> and I think <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Corregidor</span> and they went kind of away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">And only people left were the civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">Us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">And we were declared open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , a long time ago but the Japanese just didn’t’ care. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">they bombed us anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">And that is how some people did get killed, injured et cetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">We were safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">We were very, very fortunate that we did not get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">And my dad being, working with the at the <span class="DLF">docks</span> for so long, it was a miracle that he wasn’t hit by something or other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">And
QUESTION:  Before we go on to the Japanese occupation, I didn’t want to forget to ask you about whether the Filipinos treated you any differently because you were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">Whether the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> there was treated any worse than any other part of the white immigrant or refugee community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1379">ANSWER:  No, they treated us very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">I mean they to them Judaism didn’t’ mean anything different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">We believed in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">They believed in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">The majority of the people there were anyway Catholics and there was, they were very strict Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">They would go to Mass and they really respected everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">And therefore they believed in the Ten Commandments. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">Honor thy parents, love thy neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">And they really believed in that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1388">QUESTION:  Also during that period of time, before the Japanese occupation you were going to, you were still in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">At the <span class="BUILDING">Maryknoll college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">And I assume you were still going to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">So before the Japanese came, what was your life like within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1392">ANSWER:  We had a very life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">We had our get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">We had, made a lot of friends with other Jewish refugees and we children enjoyed going to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">We met our peers and we just enjoyed it and during the high holidays it was always a wonderful time for us because everybody was there, regardless of whether they were very religious or not and a lot of the people that, there were some, I shouldn’t say a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">There were some people that came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> that friends, I made friends with the Helmans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">There was Rosie Helman, Siggy Helman and Gloria Helman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">Those were the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">And Mr. and Mrs. Helman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">I don’t’ remember their first names at this moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">They had a <span class="BUILDING">boarding house</span> right on <span class="DLF">Dewey Boulevard</span> overlooking the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">And that was a very favorite <span class="NPIP">place</span> for everybody and Rosie and I became very dear friends because she went to the <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> and we just all had a very pretty good life considering you know we weren’t’ rich or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">We couldn’t take things out of their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> so we were, had to start fresh, completely fresh as I’ve said before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">There was not a whole lot left that we could rescue or salvage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">We did keep that wooden box that all our stuff came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">And my mother had packed away a couple of things, including some crystal because we only lived in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , the four of us were in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and rented all out to the other people so we could pay for this <span class="INT_SPACE">flat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">Like I say we had a hard time because they had to give money for the visa for my grandmother and already mentioned for us to be able to buy a popsicle, ice cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">I mean there, the food thing on a popsicle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">Oh that was quite a big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">We never were able to buy a Coke because those were expensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">Even five centavos we couldn’t have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">We had to save every penny to send to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">And for the visa for my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">So we were really considered quite poor in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">So when the war, I mean when the Japanese came in, we had taken, we had gotten a few furnitures of course, and all the people, the Americans had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">Now the Japanese were marching in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">We heard them coming in during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">And it was an awful feeling to hear marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">It reminded us of the Nazis in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">And we were so afraid that they were going to come into our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">And, and just kill us all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">We had heard horrible stories of what Japanese can do from people in different <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">They were very sadistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">And the first troops in were mostly Koreans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">They had taken them as the foot soldiers and the officers were Japanese and these people, the Koreans and the low, low Japanese their uniforms smelled so horrible that you could actually smell them through the <span class="DLF">windows</span> into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">And had a terrible stench about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">I don’t’ know whether they were able to wash it there or what you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">Because they were in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">I mean they were just waiting and they had to land someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">But it was very, very hard for us to all of a sudden for the Americans to the Japanese. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">We didn’t know what awaited us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">How they were going to treat us, being Jewish and of course our nuns were still at the <span class="BUILDING">Maryknoll college</span> but we were not able to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because we were afraid to go out into the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">And of course they were, later we learned they were right away interned in <span class="BUILDING">Saint Thomas</span> which as an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">internment camp</span> for Americans, for white Russians and people that they suspected of being pro-American. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">So but also then we were afraid we were going to be bombed by the Americans and so 1n a way that is also sort of what happened, but not right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">Not, they were still gathering themselves together and trying to get all the forces that were left because they, a lot of them were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bataan</span> and they didn’t’ have a lot of communications with them because the Japanese intercepted everything that went out of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1436">QUESTION:  I had asked you what your diet and life style was (file 3 — RG-50.106.0052.03.03 — duration: 01:01:04)
QUESTION:  This is continuation of an interview for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">I’m interviewing Margie Rosenthal and my name is Nancy Alper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">It’s the 24" of October 1996. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">This is the third tape of this interview, the first <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">And Margie and I were just talking about their life style, the family’s life style before the Japanese took over and afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1441">ANSWER:  Before the Japanese took over, we could go to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> and buy beef and you know better things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">However no the potatoes before the war were still there because they were imported. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">Once the Japanese moved in we did not have any fresh food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">We did not have any regular potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">We ate yams or yellow potatoes, the sweet potatoes, I should say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">And we didn’t have much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">In fact money was like going always up, up, up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">It was like inflation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">Money wasn’t worth a thing and so we ate rice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">One meal would be the rice soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">Another meal would be the rice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">Another meal would be the potato peels , the sweet potato peel and another one would be the regular sweet potato. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">But my mother became inventive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">She would take for example she would take the potato which was an awful sweet potato and she would put vinegar on it and would put salt on it and it kind of deadened the sweetness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">And it was a little bit like a potato salad, were trying to imitate that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">Then to make, in those days we still had electricity and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">So my mother would get some coconuts and with (rust?) </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">with the coconut and then squeeze out the cream and from that she would make ice cream and put that into like cubes, into cube <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trays</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freezer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">And we would have ice cream. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">I mean you had to be very inventive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">You could take flowers and make a jelly and jam out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">And later on in the things, I mean flour disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">We had then we made, we bought bread made of rice flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">We bought bread out of just about anything that you could imagine and the matzo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">We had no matzo of course so we used sour flour for matzo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">Things were really pretty rotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">And the beef came to an end as well because the caribous were, you know there were more no more caribous and the Japanese confiscated a lot of the stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">So all of a sudden we were having horse meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">But we didn’t know it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">It tasted different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">Our Dad finally told us because he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> before the war if you remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">He would say it tastes sweet and that is horse meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">Well then we didn’t want to eat that any more either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">So we stuck to a diet of fish and chicken but chicken was really a delicacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">We couldn’t hardly afford to buy a chicken so we decided we’re going to raise our own and well where do you keep a chicken, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">There was no, you can’t leave it <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">It might get stolen so we put chickens in one of the little <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> like a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> and had a bar across it and they would roost right on top of the bars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">But then the rats would come and would like to eat those poor chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">You had, you know making a lot of fluttering and screaming and screeching. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">And we would jump out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and we tried to chase the rats away from the where we had the chickens because like I said they liked to eat chickens too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">Then during the winter season we lived in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were downstairs and across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us was the house of Japanese where they were torturing Filipinos. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">Whoever they thought was a group that was against them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">And they would do the most horrible things to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">And we would see walking by. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">It was just awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">They would have men hanging upside down and would make them smoke and they would have them close their nose and mouth and they would have to inhale the smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">And they would just absolutely and they’d blow up like they would swell up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">It was just awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">Or they would pull fingernails out and toenails and the water torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">They did everything and anything to get some information out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">And that they didn’t do, they couldn’t do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">And my dad at that time, there was no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">In the beginning my dad and I were selling automobile parts, in the very beginning of the Japanese occupation because we needed to get some money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">So we would buy parts from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> and take it and sell it to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">One of our, my good customers was the cigar company. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">Hamber, I think it was called cigar company. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">And they would give me what they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">They needed say X number of piston rings, X number of spark plugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">X number of fan belts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">I mean things like that or even batteries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">So I would go and find where I could find some and then bring it to them and sell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">Now I was having a better time of sales than my dad, I guess because I was a girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">Anyway, and that way I was able to support my family some money somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">And in the meantime, of course the Americans were bombing us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1505">QUESTION:  Were you still <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ermita</span> then or had you moved to a different <span class="NPIP">location</span> and where did you get the auto parts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1506">ANSWER:  Well we still were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ermita</span> and the auto parts, people tipped us off who might be wanting to sell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">Well you had no gasoline. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">You only had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> there so you dismantled them and sold part by part because nobody could drive a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> at that point anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">Gasoline was out of the question so you had to do what you had to do and this is how I found out well these people had this and that and so I went and procured it and sold it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">And we’d separate, my dad and I. He’d go one direction and I’d go someplace else and sometimes we’d meet for lunch or whatever, downtown. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">But between the bombings, the Americans were flying way up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">And we wanted to say hooray, hooray, hooray but we didn’t dare show any kind of an emotion because that would have been the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">But then that stopped too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">And so then my dad used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">market</span> , get some linguises, they called them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">That’s a sausage and other things that he thought people would need and took it into the <span class="REGION">provinces</span> , way into the interior of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> , in that bundle into <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> , interior of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> and further out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">Well twice, my poor father was caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">The first time they thought he was a guerrilla but he talked his way out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">The second time he wasn’t so lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">He, they had him, they hand bound him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">They were going to shoot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">I mean they already had a position to sue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">And he said I can show you that I’m a Jewish person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">I had the bris, and they said that doesn’t mean anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">We do too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">We had the same operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">Don’t work, that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">So he said I can recite the Shema. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">He said how do we know that that is your prayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">We don’t’ know Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">So he was there for hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">They were keep, questioning him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">And he kept saying I am not a, I am not a spy for the Japanese. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">I am not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">Iam pro-American. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">We
QUESTION:  Now if I understand this they were rebel guerrillas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">These were not Japanese soldiers but these were the Filipinos who were fighting the Japanese.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1537">ANSWER:  That is correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">They were in the outskirts hiding underground so to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">Yes, and they, when they see a white man or what’s he doing in the <span class="REGION">province</span> , find out he’s German on top of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">Well, that means enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">And so they really wanted to kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">And so he said “look, if you’re going to kill me, do it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">Don’t prolong this anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">I’ve had enough.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">He was saying the Shema over and over and over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">And nothing they said, he said or did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">He says I have a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">I have two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">I have a, my wife is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">He said please you know this was in the Pasay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">This, in the meanwhile we had to move Ermita, because Ermita was getting very expensive, so we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pasay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">And we rented a downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">It was like a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> type thing, level to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">And that, from there we were making our trips into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and you didn’t have much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">As transportation you mostly had to walk and it was pretty hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">And anyway so my dad, this finally somebody else, the big, big macher came from the group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">And he said, “I believe this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">Let him go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">So they said ok, let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">He was so sure they were going to shoot him in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">And he took his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and started walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">He didn’t dare get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> because he was so weak by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">He was so exhausted from the interrogations and from the, the whole way they held him, hand cuffed behind his back and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">I mean he was just a broken man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">Well, they let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">But the man that told him you can go, said, “I will watch you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">I will make sure that you are telling the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">And if you’re not, you’re a dead man.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">So he told him where he, where we lived so he says “I’m going to come and check up on you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">My dad came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">He never rode the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> all the way, miles and miles and miles, kilometers over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">And he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he always was an old man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">He was so broken up about this that we said you’re not going back into that again ever, ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">You cannot do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">And so my poor father, that night, sure enough we spied, we saw somebody outside our <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">We thought it was somebody going to break in again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">And no, it was one of the people that had said they’re going to check up on him were outside our <span class="DLF">window</span> , looking in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">But barely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">You had to just kind of look in through the slats. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">But they were there checking up on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">That was the last time he went into the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">We would not let him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">I said we’d rather starve. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">Now we, like I said, we were at the floor level. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">In the back was <span class="ENV_FEATURES">swamp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">And they had fish so we would go out there and try to catch some fish for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">And we had those two chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">But you know we didn’t have heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">We did not have the heart to kill them so we gave them to a neighbor and says here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">You take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">We don’t want to eat them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">And they’re getting older. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">You better just use them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">Of course they didn’t’ give us any share at all, but the Japanese kept up their atrocities something awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">And many people didn’t make it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">I mean even some of our Jewish people were taken . </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">They found a short wave radio or sometimes they didn’t find anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">They just didn’t’ like the way you answered them and that was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1599">QUESTION:  With the Japanese patrolling on a daily basis around all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> sort of like a police force.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1600">ANSWER:  Not really patrolling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">They had <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">Little like a, it was like you see in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">You know those little <span class="BUILDING">guard houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">They had that that set up all over and when you walked by you had to bend down as low as you could because if you didn’t they just slap you left and right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">And so we learned to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">But later on we get to the idea, hey wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">We are German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">They don’t’ know the difference so we said Allemande, Allemande. </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">Deutsch, Deutsch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">And you know it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">We didn’t’ have to do it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">They bowed to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">But they were like I said pretty viscous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">And again things became, the water kept rising in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">Whenever it rained. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">It was rainy season, the piles came loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">And we, whenever we put our feet out ora hand out, it would touch water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">So we know the water had risen to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> were way up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">High up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">Everything was up high. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">And that’s how so we could open the, we had <span class="DLF">window</span> open. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">The water was as high <span class="NPIP">outside</span> as it was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">So we saw fish floating by and we tried to catch those fish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">So once in a while we were lucky and we were able to catch the fish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">So between vegetables that were growing out back and fish we didn’t need a whole lot of money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1628">QUESTION:  I think you talked about the fact that the Japanese placed their munitions near some, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburban neighborhoods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">And I’m wondering if that was true in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pasay</span> as well as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ermita</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">If that was just a general practice of the Japanese.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1631">ANSWER:  It certainly was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1632">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pasay</span> , we moved back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ermita</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">We just things were getting pretty bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">We couldn’t’ stay in that, in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the water was coming up all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">We lost a lot of things due to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">The shoes molded away, the blankets and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">So that didn’t last. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">So then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ermita</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">It was almost 1945, very close to 1945 when we moved back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ermita</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">I would say that was probably in the very beginning of 45. </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">And the bombings of the Americans increased. </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">Then came shelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1643">They had, they dropped leaflets and were telling us that they had already come to the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> by dropping leaflets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">So we knew the end was near. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">We could just hold out a little bit longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">And we had ok, also we, up until that time we were able to go to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">And we were able to go every week to services. </span><span class="sentence" id="1648">But when the shell, the bombings got worse and worse, it really was very dangerous to be <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1649">And there was no place to really hide because there were no <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> because it was too low. </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">It was water underneath, not far down, we had water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">So we couldn’t build any <span class="BUILDING">air shelters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">So you had to hope for the best. </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">That was about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">So then we were again back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ermita</span> and then the Japanese had been storing ammunition in between the civilians because they knew that the, if the Americans knew civilians lived there, they would not bomb the civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">So they very smartly put gasoline, ammunition, anything that was flammable to put in- between the civilians, like maybe two houses of civilian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">The third one would have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">Or five <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> of civilians and a big bloc of Japanese. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">So they were all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">And we knew more or less where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">So we but we, where else can you run. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">I mean you can’t keep running so we were at one <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">It used to be a dressmaker’s place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">That was our very last stand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">We were so tired of moving and running away and no matter <span class="NPIP">where</span> we went we were getting bombed or getting shelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">It really didn’t’ make any difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1666">QUESTION:  I know you told me that you also sold pies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">And I’m wondering where that fit in and 1n this time period we’re discussing and if you reached a point where there simply wasn’t anything you could do anymore to earn money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1668">ANSWER:  Well the pies came at a very late date also because like I said food was running out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">So this one lady was baking pies and I took it to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where they still had some doctors and nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">And also the people that were discharged from the <span class="BUILDING">prisons</span> were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">And there was one Jewish man that I, basically that was the one I really, really remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">Because I had known him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">His name was Moser. </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">And he was laying on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , white. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">His legs were saw raw that he couldn’t even put his legs together and he was so thin that there was nothing left and he looked almost like what you see nowadays with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">Exactly that’s what he looked like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">They starved him, they beat him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">They did everything you can possibly imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">He could barely talk to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">And I brought a pie over to him and I fed him because I felt that was the only thing I could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">I would explain what happened to that pie later on to the lady that made them, but he had to have some nourishment and I started feeding him small little pieces and he ate it and his eyes became big and cause he couldn’t really show much emotion at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">He was just too, too tired of living, too tired of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">And the pies like I said you know I sold as long as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">And that stopped as well because the bombing got more severe and more severe and by that time, the Americans were already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Intramuros</span> , in that <span class="REGION">area</span> we heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">So it was time to just put an end to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">And so we were in this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that we had taken over from the dressmaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">And across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from us were this red light <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the red light <span class="BUILDING">district house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">And I was standing in the <span class="DLF">doorway</span> of our <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1689">And all of a sudden this Japanese soldier comes in, grabs me and was trying to drag me up the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">I am crying, I am yelling and my mother is holding me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1691">My sister is holding my mother and my father is holding my, my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1692">My mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">Well anyway, one after the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">And I am trying to hold onto the bannister and he’s pulling me, he’s much stronger than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1695">By this time I had amoebic dysentery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1696">And I was very weak and so this, finally dad let go and he says I’m running <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and see if I find a, an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">Lucky, he found an officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">Do you speak English? </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">Do you speak German? </span><span class="sentence" id="1700">English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1701">Help us, help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1702">My daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1703">She’s not one of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">So he came in and he, I was already on the top of the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1705">And all of a sudden the officer arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1706">And yelled something in Japanese and the, this soldier froze. </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">And I was, I was hysterical by this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">I mean I was completely, I was so bad, I couldn’t even walk downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1709">They carried me down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">And I was there and the officer called him to come down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">The guy came down, this soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">He took him and he beat him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">I mean I, after a while I actually felt sorry for this guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1714">Not only did he beat him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">He knocked him to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and then he kicked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1716">And he was still apologizing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">This, this police, I mean this solider was apologizing to this, to this officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">Anyway it was very lucky for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">It was really it was very, one of the fortunate instances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">Well then this all was coming to an end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1721">The Japanese were making, going from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> interrogating or taking people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">My dad said goodby already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1723">My mother said goodby to us too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">And said that your aunt is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and I want you to go there after the war because if we are not around, you have to be the, you have to be in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">And he said, again he started saying the Shema and dad said this is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">I’m sorry, you girls will have to fend for yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">The Americans are not far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">So you know be calm and do what they say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">So guess what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">They were next door, avoided our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , went to the next one and you could her people screaming and crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was loading up all these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">And we were scared and next day in the morning they brought some of the women back, not the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">We never saw the men again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">And then that night, all of a sudden we hear bombing, shelling and fire starting in our immediate <span class="REGION">area</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1735">QUESTION:  These people who were the victims of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to house search, were these Filipinos, Americans, refugees.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1736">ANSWER:  Only Filipinos. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">There were no more white people around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">We were just living among Filipinos.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1739">QUESTION:  Do you think that they in these two instances helped you in the instance of the soldier who was dragging you up the <span class="DLF">steps</span> and spared you in the instance you just described because you were Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1740">ANSWER:  We think that might have happened because how else I mean we had the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">I mean we were side by side we’d go from one to the next to the next. </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">I mean you know how, we assumed that maybe this officer when somehow word must have spread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">Say don’t go there, those are Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">Maybe the hand of God was over us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">What, we don’t’ know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">We just don’t’ know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">We only know that we were spared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">And then that night we had to leave that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and we thought we’ll never come back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">And we hid in about a block away where still no flames. </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">And we went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">In the morning we heard that that <span class="DLF">street</span> had not burned yet so we cautiously made our way back there and sure it was not burned yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">So my father said now I they next time the flames are going to get closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">We better grab what we’re going to take if we can carry it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1755">QUESTION:  When you say flames, you’re talking about flames from what the bombs had set on fire in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , what was burning as a result of the bombing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1756">ANSWER:  Shelling, the shelling, not the bombing at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1757">It was mainly the heavy, heavy shelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1758">By the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1759">And they just shot into it because the Japanese were intermingled with us and the ammunition and the gasoline and daddy, my father said we don’t want to go up in flames and be thrown to smithereens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">We just might as well leave while we still can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">So that morning we gathered all our meager, one photo album, the address for my aunt and the visa, affidavits for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">I, my dad told me to take the electric plate over my neck and that was heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">And the dog and the leash. </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">We had a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="1765">And my sister couldn’t’ carry anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1766">She was too, I was 17 at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1767">and so my sister she was, what 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">So I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">Maybe they gave her something to carry also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">And on top of that we had again bought some chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">Raw, live chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1772">And they were making such a racket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1773">So we gave it to somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1774">And said we don’t’ want to be, we can’t kill them anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1775">Just take them, just go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">So we gave them to somebody who I don’t even know who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">And we went to this <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> that was down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and in that <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> we went to that <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> that was standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1778">That was a very high rise <span class="BUILDING">building</span> for those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1779">And in the bottom, or as you walked in from off the <span class="DLF">street</span> were sandbags Well apparently a bomb, a shell had come into there and had not exploded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1780">A great big thing and one bomb was also in the <span class="DLF">shaft</span> , <span class="DLF">elevator shaft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1781">And we figured well let’s lay down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1782">I mean we've got to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1783">At least it’s far enough, even though that explodes it’Il give us some protection with these bags around the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1784">Well we didn’t expect a shell to come right, explode, come right into the, it was like a <span class="DLF">carport</span> almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">Open on all the <span class="NPIP">sides</span> you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">And it came right in and exploded and it was phosphorous now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1787">And the explosion of it, threw me under a very low <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1788">It was like maybe 5 inches, 6 inches off the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1789">It pushed me underneath that and my mother got hit with shrapnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1790">Our dog ran away at that time and we were looking for the dog afterwards but it was just as well because where we were before had taken our dog was barking at all the Japanese. </span><span class="sentence" id="1791">We didn’t know how to keep her quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1792">So when this explosion happened, she took off which was probably a blessing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1793">Anyway so we I thought I said I think I’m dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1794">I couldn’t’ breathe because of the phosphor in my lungs, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1795">And my mother was bleeding from her shrapnel wounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1796">So we got out of there and went to a maybe a block away to a <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> that had burned I mean the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1797">A <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that had already burned out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1798">All those left were the bottom with hot, hot coals like tiles and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1799">But where else can we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1800">We stayed there for just a little bit, maybe one night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1801">That didn’t work very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1802">So then we went to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> which was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atenao</span> , a parochial school for boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1803">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was already occupied by a lot of refugees so there was no more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1804">So the other people that were <span class="NPIP">outside</span> were sitting in <span class="DLF">ditches</span> that had been placed around the whole parameter of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1805">Well that’s where we were when the shots kept coming over our heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="1806">And my mother still had that shrapnel in her but what could we do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">There were no doctors, medics, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1808">So all we did was we put some bandage on her and that was all we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1809">And then we, shell, a big shrapnel fell between my mother and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1810">If we had been closer it would have killed one of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1811">Well we figured out that wasn’t a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stay again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1812">So again we started moving around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1813">So then we spied this, oh that was several blocks away because we knew that this was going to go up and sure enough that night, our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , our <span class="NPIP">place</span> , that whole <span class="DLF">block</span> went up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1814">In explosion because a shell had hit there as well and it hit our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1815">It also was hitting already close to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were living before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1816">So we had to go further. </span><span class="sentence" id="1817">So we walked and we w
QUESTION:  United States Holocaust Memorial Museum with Margie Rosenthal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1818">Nancy Alper, October the 26" 1996. </span><span class="sentence" id="1819">This is the second side of the third tape of the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="1820">And we were talking about what I assume was part of the battle of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manila</span> , at the very end of the war in the Pacific against the Japanese, or close to the end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1821">ANSWER:  The, we had finally come upon this <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> that had a <span class="DLF">roof</span> like I said, three sides but the front was all open. </span><span class="sentence" id="1822">We were in like sardines. </span><span class="sentence" id="1823">We tried to get out of the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1824">But we barely made it in because a lot of people there already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">And there was one Jewish lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="1826">She had her maid there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1827">She had her cushions there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1828">She had everything that it could possibly could think of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">She would not move an inch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1830">So we all were trying to help each other, trying to get In as many people as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1831">Well we couldn’t lic down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1832">I mean it was you just laid to the side of yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1833">Anyway, and then we were across the <span class="DLF">street</span> was a whole contingent of Japanese. </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">The whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was occupied by Japanese soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1835">And pretty soon these Japanese came over, wanted the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1836">And being that I was very undernourished, underweight, didn’t have much on me, they didn’t see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1837">They thought I was just a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1838">But there were some girls there that were well endowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1839">They lined them all up and they said you, you, you, you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1840">Come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1841">Well one of them was the daughter of optometrist that we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1842">And he went up to this soldier who said you, you, you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1843">He said watch, my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1844">And so he understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1845">He let the girl go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1846">And he gave him his gold watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">Then he asked for the men to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">So all the men including my father of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1849">He was lining them up and we thought oh my god, he’s going to shoot them all now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1850">Imean what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1851">So my dad, said German, German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1852">That saved him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1853">So he sent him back to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1854">But the other ones they took along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1855">They didn’t shoot them right in front of our faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1856">They just took them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1857">So that gave us a little bit more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> which is a sad thing to say you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1858">But that’s when the moment you say German that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1859">So then we had no food, no water and at this time we were pretty worn out by running around from one <span class="REGION">area</span> to another <span class="REGION">area</span> and nothing to eat but we had had with us a little bit of drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="1860">My dad had saved some whiskey in a bottle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1861">And he said we were going to use this when we are liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1862">Well this was an emergency. </span><span class="sentence" id="1863">And we had no more water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1864">So when, they, I looked across the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ruins</span> and I saw a bunch of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1865">I said looks to me like they’re going for water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1866">I saw them lowering a can on a string. </span><span class="sentence" id="1867">I said that looks to me like that might have been a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1868">I’m going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1869">So my dad said, no I’m going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1870">I said no you’re not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1871">Because you are man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1872">You might get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1873">You are staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1874">I said I’m going to take my sister, Eva. </span><span class="sentence" id="1875">So she and I had this flask that was used to probably wine in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1876">It was kind of a maybe a five gallon jug, empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1877">So I said I’m going to go because whatever, we had nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1878">I mean we found it along the way somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1879">I that’s not what we carried because we had nothing, except what we had on our body, the photo album and a stamp album and electric plate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">And when you throw yourself down, by that time I’d lost the electric plate also already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">I didn’t’ have that anymore because that was at least it was heavy and how could you fall on top of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1882">It was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1883">So I left 1t some time ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">So then I said, let’s go Eva. </span><span class="sentence" id="1885">So we walked over there to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I saw those women and they were fighting over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1886">I mean there were so , maybe 60 and I had no way of even getting close to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1887">So I just stood there and what next. </span><span class="sentence" id="1888">How am I going to obtain water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1889">We needed water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1890">All of a sudden shelling started, whizzing right over our heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="1891">Well the Filipinos, these were all Filipinos that we are talking about, all lay down flat on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1892">So that they wouldn’t’ be hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1893">And I said Eva lay down too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1894">And I said look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1895">She says come on lay down, lay down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1896">I said no I can’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1897">I have got to get the water while I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1898">I’m going to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1899">So that’s exactly what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1900">I took the can that was standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1901">I lowered it, brought up this filthy looking water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1902">Threw it into the jug. </span><span class="sentence" id="1903">I got a few cans because the bombing, the shelling goes on for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1904">I mean once one hits, then there are several. </span><span class="sentence" id="1905">And I was standing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1906">I said to my sister, I said if it hits me, you take the water and you carry it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , carry it to the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1907">So I was standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1908">And I, everything’s fate in my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1909">And that’s what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1910">I got the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1911">The shelling stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1912">We didn’t get a whole lot but we got enough to tide us over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1913">So I said come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1914">Grab the one end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1915">I grabbed the other <span class="NPIP">end</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1916">We stumbled over all the ruins and the burned out things and no, nothing was standing anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1917">Everything was just flattened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1918">But you know stones and, and glass whatever have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1919">So we made it right back to the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> and my dad took the whiskey and put some into the, into the water we had and that we were survived and had water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1920">And then the next day we were, I had to go, we had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1921">I had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1922">I’m <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and all of a sudden, this soldier comes up to me and I thought it was a Japanese and I’m already going like this with my head down and my hands over my head and, and just cowering down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1923">He said “get up, get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1924">We are here, we are here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1925">I jumped up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1926">I said “an Americans, you’re Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1927">And he said “yes” cause they were camouflaged with mud on their faces and they had things over their head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1928">The helmets and regular invasion forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1929">And he said “where’s the rest of your people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1930">And I said “over there in that <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> ’. </span><span class="sentence" id="1931">He says “ok, I didn’t know there were more civilians” he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1932">I said “yes, but be careful.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1933">I said “There are sentries in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1934">They see you, they’re going to kill you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1935">So he called over to where my parents were and other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1936">Had them crawl out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1937">I never went back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1938">I just showed him where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1939">I stayed, he said “don’t you go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1940">Stay right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1941">I’m coming for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1942">And that’s what happened and he brought the civilians out, calling and then running. </span><span class="sentence" id="1943">And he says “you run as fast as you can over all these dead people,” over the corpses that had already started to smell and I mean stink horrible and the ants and the worms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1944">Oh it’s just horrible and that’s what we saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="1945">And we passed that and by the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1946">We reached, we reached the, the <span class="DLF">American lines</span> , they put us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and took us to <span class="BUILDING">Santa Ana cabaret</span> where 2000 people were already there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1947">And anyway, 2000 people were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1948">And we stayed there for that night and about two nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1949">And we were famished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1950">And they had a <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> is that what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1951">And we ate the soup that they served us and that was the best thing that we ever ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1952">I mean we were so hungry that anything and everything would have been just wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1953">Of course, I did not even have a period because all the excitement, no nourishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1954">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1955">I mean so I didn’t have to worry about that at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1956">And so we were laying there with thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1957">Like I said it was a <span class="BUILDING">dancing hall</span> before and they called it <span class="BUILDING">Santa Ana cabaret</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1958">And we met some other people but they came, not all, too many of our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1959">And then we went and said, we walked along someplace else to see if we could find shelter elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1960">And we came to this one man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1961">And he said come upstairs and you know itll be ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="1962">And I said “no, I have to get my parents”. </span><span class="sentence" id="1963">He said “bring your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1964">I don’t care”. </span><span class="sentence" id="1965">So I brought my parents and we stayed there for a night or so and I said, and then my mother and dad said “no we can’t take his hospitality. </span><span class="sentence" id="1966">He doesn’t have enough himself.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1967">So we started walking and we saw a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a vacant <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1968">Oh maybe a couple or three blocks away and we went towards that and we took shelter in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1969">Well that night it started again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1970">The shelling and the firing and a bullet came in through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , hit the, the iron bars and then fell on top of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1971">It burned me but did not penetrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1972">And it was on my breast and I threw it off you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1973">And I thought I was going to, I thought I was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1974">I mean very honestly I thought I was shot, but it was just a hot bullet that had expanded its force. </span><span class="sentence" id="1975">So the next morning, we knew we couldn’t stay there because there was a Japanese sen, a guy that used to be a sentry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1976">He had still hold out up there and he was shooting down at the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1977">The Americans didn’t even know he was there until I showed them the bullet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1978">I said I got shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1979">And they said let me see the bullet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1980">And they said that’s a Japanese bullet or German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1981">What do I know and they said I will, I'd like to have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1982">I said if you give it back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1983">That’s got to be my souvenir. </span><span class="sentence" id="1984">I never saw it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1985">So then where do we go from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1986">Well we didn’t’ really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1987">So then my sister and I walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1988">I said well while we are still in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because we had nowhere else to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1989">They were trying to shoot him and we were in the, in the <span class="DLF">fire line</span> ok. </span><span class="sentence" id="1990">But finally the, the shooting stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1991">I said Eva, you and I. Let’s go and I’Il get, I hear there’s a <span class="DLF">well</span> not far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1992">Let’s go wash our hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1993">I can’t stand 1t anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1994">we are full of mud. </span><span class="sentence" id="1995">And everything else and dust and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1996">So we walked to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1997">I mean to the <span class="DLF">well</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1998">Got, washed our hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1999">On the way back we run into a GI. </span><span class="sentence" id="2000">And he says “a white girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="2001">Out here, white kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="2002">What happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="2003">I didn’t think any white people were here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2004">And I said “yeah, yeah we have white people here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2005">Well this is my sister and our name is Mijinski, Margot Mijinski. </span><span class="sentence" id="2006">He said you Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="2007">I said “yes”. </span><span class="sentence" id="2008">I said “yeah so are my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="2009">I want you to meet them”. </span><span class="sentence" id="2010">So we went back where the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2011">And he said “you guys can’t stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2012">Come with me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2013">And it turned out he was Jewish too. </span><span class="sentence" id="2014">He was 33 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="2015">He was invasion forces, armed forces 37 Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="2016">And he was the one that gave me my very first book, reading material. </span><span class="sentence" id="2017">And then he somehow, he managed to take us and other people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Caisson City</span> where they will put us into an old <span class="BUILDING">school house</span> that we, they converted for refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="2018">So I don’t know how many, again a hundred people or more were in this very small <span class="BUILDING">school house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2019">And we, they divided, the partitions were like sheets. </span><span class="sentence" id="2020">Families were like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2021">And that’s then I got myself a job from my girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="2022">She saw me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2023">QUESTION:  Was this Ernest Benesch?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2024">ANSWER:  Yes it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="2025">That was Ernest Benesch. </span><span class="sentence" id="2026">Our savior. </span><span class="sentence" id="2027">He was, he brought us fruits, he brought us food, at, ever he could get from the commissary over there and from the <span class="BUILDING">mess hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2028">And he gave us some food and K, K rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="2029">I mean he was the very first one to give us something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2030">And even some chocolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="2031">I mean he was just wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2032">QUESTION:  How long did you stay in that <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> and how did either the army or some other organization help you to settle into a more livable situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2033">ANSWER:  We were in that <span class="BUILDING">school house</span> for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="2034">We then around the corner we found that somebody had an empty almost like a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2035">It was horrible, no rugs, we had <span class="INT_SPACE">cement floors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2036">But there were a couple of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> in there so we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2037">And from there we, we waited until our visa, then they con, everybody contacted us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2038">The Red Cross was around of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="2039">They gave us clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2040">We had nothing as you know They gave us clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2041">They even gave me my first sanitary napkin. </span><span class="sentence" id="2042">And they fed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2043">I mean we just kind of survived and we couldn’t leave until 1948 and we were in that very, around the corner from that <span class="BUILDING">school house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2044">We were staying there.</span></p>

id="2071">And I said I don’t even know if she ever knows what a balloon looks like. </span><span class="sentence" id="2072">He says no I can’t give you that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2073">I was so upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="2074">When I went upstairs to see the Helmans. </span><span class="sentence" id="2075">I slept over there by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="2076">I only went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on weekends cause the distance was very far and I had to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="2077">There was no transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="2078">There was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2079">And so I told the Helmans what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="2080">That these beautiful new balloons were laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2081">They wouldn’t even give me one for my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="2082">And they said no you don’t want that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2083">That’s those rubbers that the officers use when they bring in girls and then it dawned on me what it actually was. </span><span class="sentence" id="2084">But that’s how, to show you how innocent and how ignorant I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="2085">And then, from then on in, I was able to bring food to my parents and I met a lot of officers up there, GIs and they took us to dances and Rosie and I and Siggy they took us to all these dances. </span><span class="sentence" id="2086">But you know every time there was backfire from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , I thought it was an explosion. </span><span class="sentence" id="2087">I dove under the under anything and everything I could find for protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="2088">And they would just stand there and laugh. </span><span class="sentence" id="2089">I said look it’s a very sad experience for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2090">Don’t laugh. </span><span class="sentence" id="2091">Because to me I feel like I’m being shot at. </span><span class="sentence" id="2092">And it took me a long time to get over this backfire. </span><span class="sentence" id="2093">I always thought that I was being shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2094">And so we went over there and then the rabbi, the chaplain, we had a Passover at one of the <span class="BUILDING">commissaries</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="2095">He was able to locate a <span class="NPIP">place</span> ; that was our very first Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="2096">And we, in fact I still have their Passover books, the Hagadah in a bound, what the GIs would carry with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2097">And that rabbi Felden was the very first chaplain that was in 1946, we had our very first Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="2098">And I was so nervous. </span><span class="sentence" id="2099">I was so upset about everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="2100">That I, well I was nervous to go to a dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="2101">I would break out in hives. </span><span class="sentence" id="2102">I mean completely from top to bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="2103">And I was itching and I was, and then I found out I was allergic to the shellfish that I was eating at the Helmans. </span><span class="sentence" id="2104">| didn’t know what I was supposed to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="2105">Besides that, I wanted to go back just one more time. </span><span class="sentence" id="2106">My mother had pleurisy before we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="2107">And we talked to this a rabbi like person. </span><span class="sentence" id="2108">Maybe it was Mr. Konigsberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="2109">At this point I don’t’ even know who told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2110">It’s ok to eat pork. </span><span class="sentence" id="2111">You got to get meat, you got to eat meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="2112">Otherwise, you’ ll never get over this pleurisy. </span><span class="sentence" id="2113">And my mother didn’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="2114">He said look you’Il making, doing a sin more so by not eating than you would be by trying to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="2115">The thing 1s now survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="2116">And that’s when finally she would eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="2117">We would try to buy some meat for her, not us, for her but she shared with us of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="2118">We’d buy just the, the like the hoofs or the head or something because we had to cook that up for her and it was the hardest thing for her to do, to eat that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2119">And then finally we got visas and it was in 1948, in February. </span><span class="sentence" id="2120">And we boarded upon an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army transport</span> and women in one <span class="NPIP">section</span> , men in another <span class="REGION">section</span> lined up for the <span class="BUILDING">mess hall</span> to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="2121">We went over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> because we didn’t have, we didn’t’ have any warm clothes so in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> we got some clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2122">And then we made it to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> where our relatives and aunt Ruth. </span><span class="sentence" id="2123">She in the meantime after her husband had passed away, Mr. Binger, she married Ernest Karliner who also adopted my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="2124">And they were waiting for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2125">They had an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> just across from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2126">And SO We were, we were taken in over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2127">And I met my husband in the <span class="DLF">Golden Gate Park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2128">He was seeing a friend of his. </span><span class="sentence" id="2129">We were walking very first week we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="2130">We were walking in the <span class="DLF">Golden Gate Park</span> and my husband saw this friend of his that came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2131">And he came up to me, up to the where we were and he says oh how about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="2132">I haven’t seen you since <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2133">He’s telling his friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="2134">And the friend said oh let me introduce to you Ernie and Margie Mijinski and he said to my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="2135">Now my husband said to me, you know you look like somebody I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2136">You look somebody like, somebody I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2137">I said “sure I’ve heard that <span class="DLF">line</span> before.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2138">He said “no I mean it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2139">You look like a Mrs. Karliner. </span><span class="sentence" id="2140">I says Karliner, that’s my aunt.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2141">And he says my goodness, they’ve been telling me about you for years, that if you ever come to the <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> , I must meet you. </span><span class="sentence" id="2142">And slowly we got together and about, this was in 1948 when we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="2143">And in 1949 I got married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2144">QUESTION:  Margie, because you had people who could sponsor you in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , which I assume you still needed even though you had a visa that was supposed to get you to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> from 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="2145">Why did it take so long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2146">ANSWER:  Well because it took so long because my mother had German quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="2147">My dad was Polish quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="2148">Even though he never really lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> but he was now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> , it was Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="2149">And the Polish had a very small quota. </span><span class="sentence" id="2150">And so he said you guys go ahead and we would leave him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2151">In fact, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> they offered the children to be taken to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and we refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="2152">I said I’m not going without you mom and dad and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="2153">I’m not leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="2154">Oh no you take your little sister with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="2155">I said no way, I’m not. </span><span class="sentence" id="2156">And that’s we stayed together and when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> , my dad got a job as a janitor. </span><span class="sentence" id="2157">I worked, I was trying to sell advertising which I had in my middle I was, after the war I was selling movie slides advertising. </span><span class="sentence" id="2158">And that’s how I was helping to support my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="2159">And that’s, and then my husband, he had a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oakland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2160">So after we got married, I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2161">So.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2162">QUESTION:  What were the hardest things for you and your family to adjust to when you got to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2163">ANSWER:  Well we had to get started. </span><span class="sentence" id="2164">We had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2165">Just what the Red Cross had given us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2166">And so we had to get a life again. </span><span class="sentence" id="2167">But we stayed up in the, with furnished <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where my aunt lived on side. </span><span class="sentence" id="2168">We lived on the other same <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2169">It was very beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2170">And like I said I went looking for a job right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="2171">I got a job through an <span class="BUILDING">agency</span> in an <span class="BUILDING">insurance company</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2172">I worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2173">They promised me they would promote me, promote me but every time three months were up they put me into another and wouldn’t give me a raise. </span><span class="sentence" id="2174">And after the second time I said forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2175">I’m out of here and I left and I had another job and then we got married and I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oakland</span> and we are now in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> already since 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2176">QUESTION:  Was it important to you that Ernie had been through a similar experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="2177">Did that have anything to do with your choice of him as your husband?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2178">ANSWER:  It certainly did. </span><span class="sentence" id="2179">I wanted to marry another Jewish man of my background and he was somebody that I really liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="2180">A very gentle, generous caring person. </span><span class="sentence" id="2181">And we’ve been married 47 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2182">QUESTION:  Let me ask you one more question. </span><span class="sentence" id="2183">I know we need to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="2184">How do you think all of this has affected the way that you view your life and the way you have lived your life since all of this happened to you and your family and it was such an unusual experience in so many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="2185">And the last thing I was going to ask you is how did you find out about the fate of the rest of your family that had stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2186">ANSWER:  Never really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="2187">We had to assume. </span><span class="sentence" id="2188">We tried to contact them then through the Aufbau, through all the different Jewish organizations and there was absolutely no trace of anybody alive, nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="2189">So we had to assume that they all perished because there is nobody, nobody ever responded. </span><span class="sentence" id="2190">The Jewish committee, the HIAS, the Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="2191">Nobody was able to locate anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="2192">And as far as it having affected me personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="2193">As I have been getting older, it’s been harder and I’m now in therapy. </span><span class="sentence" id="2194">Under a psychologist because things are, they’re really getting to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2195">And ’ma very nervous person and the therapist feels that this all dates back to my young days when I was growing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="2196">Not enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="2197">Leaving my grandmother leaving that I think was the hardest part of my whole exodus of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , having to leave my grandmother, my aunt, my uncle, but my grandmother was the number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="2198">And then I never got to see her again. </span><span class="sentence" id="2199">So that’s about it.</span></p>
