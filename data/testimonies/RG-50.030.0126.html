<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell me your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Carla Lessing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> uh on November 4th, 1929. (</span><span class="sentence" id="4">laughter) I have to think about this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Tell me about your parents, your early childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Uh, let me tell you first about my father's family. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">They are Heijmans and most of the family uh lived in the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My father's father was Dutch and my father's mother was a German Jew and her name was Rosalie, and my father's father was Jacob. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Uh they had three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Uh I think my father was the oldest, then my aunt who died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and a younger brother who died of diabetes in 1922, '24 - I don't know exactly and his name was Herman. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Uh my father met my mother in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and my mother is, was a German Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">She grew up in the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and she was one of three. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Uh she was the middle child. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Her older brother, Rudie, immigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ’ in 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Uh my mother married my father in 1925 and moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Uh my youngest brother, her youngest...my youngest uncle, her youngest brother, immigrated in 1934 or 'S to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and he uh studied in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so there's a lot of German in my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Uh...my parents settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> uh when they got married in 1925. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My brother, Herman, uh who is now called Johanem (ph) who lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , was born in August 1926 and I was born in November 1929 also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">In 1930 they moved to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> to get away from my mother's in- laws who were very intrusive. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My father's sister had already moved away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> because of the same reason and they moved in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> near the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Uh now the story about my parents' financial problems are very vague because nobody told me and my father died in...actually he committed suicide in 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Before he died, they moved from a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> to a very small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> or small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I was sent to my grandparents in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My grandparents lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gelsenkirchen</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My brother who was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at that time stayed with my parents and later on with my mother and I was sent away because moving and the problems so I, I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1935 and 1936 as a youngster before I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So there is a big difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">At that time already Jews were very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I was a little girl and when I was on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , my grandparents would say, don't speak too loudly, uh don't hop, don't skip, uh uh don't make yourself noticed because there were all the Nazis around us and so at a very early age I was already aware that I was different, that I was Jewish, I shouldn't be noticed, should be quiet. (</span><span class="sentence" id="29">Cough) Also my grandparents did all kinds of things to be Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I mean they were not ' Palestine really religious but they would go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> because they felt as a Jew you needed to stay together. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">So I had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on the sabath_ and uh participate. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So I went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> probably in April, May of 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I spoke German at that time because I, my grandparents spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I came back and my mother sent me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> uh for me to quickly pick up the Dutch and I went to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> and then to first grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I then came to a new <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because I had moved...when I left for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I had lived in a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I came to an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and my father wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So...and my mother was a widow and uh had a very hard time making money and so we were very poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Uh my mother and my brother and I did go back and forth to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">For my school vacations I would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so my mother had some free time I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And so in 1936, in 1937, in 1938 I spent my vacations in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with my grandparents, and kind of was aware of what was happening then. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So...and my mother would be taking jewelry from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> when she would bring us and she would hang herself up with jewelry from my grandparents and from other families and so there was already kind of a preparation for, you know, saving some money or some jewels or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Also some of my grandmother's family uh were immigrating to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , so we had families coming through before they boarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So we were kind of prepared for all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Uh I was...go back to my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> days...I was one of two in my class who was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">There was another boy who was Jewish, and the Dutch were very good at uh respecting the Jews so when the Princess Beatrice was born and all the Dutch school children gotuh (ph) —__(ph) with some orange sprinkles on it, they got for the Jewish children kosher _ (ph) with butter on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So they were very, you know, we were very well respected. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Uh I had around the corner where I lived was my . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">She was my best friend who was also Jewish and we did play a whole lot together. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Uh and so up until 19...1940, until the war broke out in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , we we were pretty I guess comfortable there as assimilated Jews and there was nothing too much going on except that I knew and my mother knew and my brother knew what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and anytime it could come. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So when the war broke out on May 5th, uh it was kind of anticipated but still a terrible shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">What happened on that day was that...or like my husband said early in the morning the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> flew over and we were, I was certainly petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">They came very low. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We didn't know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Uh and there was bombing in, I guess in the norther part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I was still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> then and then we had heard the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We had heard, we could hear the bombing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rotterdam</span> , and I, I know I was petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I was absolutely petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Uh it was over in five days and uh kind of we tried to resume our lives but that kind of...very slowly all kinds of laws against the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We were uh started up and we were limited, limited a little bit more and more and more. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Uh what you had to do first was you had to go to some <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and of course I didn't go because I was a child, where you had to sign in and you had to sign in and write exactly how many Jewish grandparents you had. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So my mother went there and she had four Jewish grandparents and she wrote this in and I had four Jewish grandparents and my brother had four Jewish grandparents and we were signed up and wonderful for the Jews...they could find us any time. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And uh I still went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for one year but in the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that I went to uh originally uh but feeling a little different because every time there were some other things happening to us like uh you had to bring uh in your gold and any kind of jewelry and you had to bring it in or your had to bring in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Small things all the time were, were asked to bring into the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> and give them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Uh now since we were very poor and I had gotten a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> from, a second-hand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> from friends of ours and my brother had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and so we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> but my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> was a small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , small-sized <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> and they didn't want it, so I came back with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , but since none of my Jewish friends had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> , I couldn't ride my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , so uh my mother was already a little cleaver because she had seen what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , uh was hiding some of gold rings and some things already. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Now, to back-track a little bit...my grandparents were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the Kristallnacht and they got out, I believe in July or August of 1939, and they settled with my uncle in the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Uh they came with maybe eight guildens and they were very well-to-do German Jews in in in and uh they had, they gave ever....they had to give everything away and they came with no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Uh so they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and they lived with my youngest uncle who took care of them the rest of their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Uh at the end of 1941, we heard we couldn't go back to the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> again and that they would organize a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> maybe three-quarters of an hour away from us in and that we had to sign up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So all the Jewish kids in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> like my friend and her brother and myself and my brother and some friends would go to that particular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that was organized, and I couldn't say goodbye to my friends in the previous <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , so in, I believe in September or so of 1941 we all walked...we kind of started walking and we picked up these kids up to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because it took us quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Now I remember that as a very good time because we were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It was like uh a family and everybody knew kind of what was up and and that year in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> although at the end of that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year people disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">It was very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">People kind of disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Now...and we never knew what happened...if they were picked up or they fled or they went into hiding, so sometimes we came to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and there were less people. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Now at, towards the end of that school year uh it became very evident that we probably would not go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> anymore there because that was when in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> they started to uh pick up people and sent them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and uh so... LONG PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We're back on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  I was...I guess I was talking about that uh...the year in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> was kind of a wonderful year with uh...but at the end of that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> year people kind of disappeared and we didn't know where they went, if they were picked up or if they were fleeing to uh <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , wherever to...or if they went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Uh also during that year we were supposed to, we were supposed to...we had to wear the Jewish star. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And so uh we walked around with the Jewish star. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We were...could not go into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We couldn't do actually anything very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Uh and somehow in order to deal with all this, I became pretty proud of wearing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I guess it was like a...dealing with something that was horrible was kind of turning it around and saying I'm proud to be a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Now my mother was not a religious Jew, uh but my brother did become bar mitzvahed and once in a while we had to go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , but we were not religious really so...but we were very Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">We uh...I...1n <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> I was very dark, very dark hair and uh I looked very Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So did my mother who had black hair and black eyes and looked very Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">My brother, he was blond at that time and he did look less Jewish, but we were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Now what was also different is that my mother was a German Jew and she uh had a very strong German accent. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">She also had a whole lot of contact with German Jews who had fled <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1939 and uh '38 and uh so she knew a whole lot of stories what had gone on uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and we were kind of aware because these people were terrible displaced, these German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Uh what happened in kind of...[...1 got...in June, July, we kind of were informed that the first people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> would be shipped and these were the young men, sixteen years and older uh to work camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Now my mother had a friend uh who told her that there was a Catholic priest who would help her find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">My mother had said we don't...we don't go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">That's too far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Uh and she kind of had made up her mind that's too far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">You don't go with your whole family too far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I mean you don't...you just don't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And since she had already a little bit experience how to defy the Germans like, you know, getting money and jewelry out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , she knew kind of how to do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I think she was not as afraid as most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Anyway, the Catholic priest came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and that was very unusual because we had never had contact with any Catholic priest and he was uh from St., from St. Francis...St. Fransican I guess...he was in kind of in garb. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">He didn't have a suit on and he was in sandals so he was quite different and he was...and I don't know if he was an older man or a younger man, but he was a very, very lively man and made us feel very much at ease and he said that he had a woman in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> who would take my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And he told us that this woman wanted to do some good because she had sinned so much in her life that...and was very fearful that she would go to <span class="NPIP">hell</span> and that by rescuing or taking in a Jewish man, maybe she would go to <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So that was the very beginning from our uh we planning to go in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Now uh what happened was very, very quickly is that we thought that my brother was going to be called up to go but very quickly afterwards we found out that my mother and myself would go...had to go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Now what they did was, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> certainly, uh you would get an announcement in the mail or with your name on it and you were supposed to go at twelve midnight to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Trolley car</span> would take you to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> would take you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Restabourk</span> (ph), the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dutch concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">That was apparently the gathering point. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">That was the instructions. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Uh so my brother had kind of a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where he could go and so when we heard that we might need to go too, my mother contacted the Catholic priest again and said, you know, we have to go too. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We can't, you know, look, we almost, we almost have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So he went to the woman and said could the mother and the sister come too, and she kind of agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So we had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Now we had to go from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and walk to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">You're not supposed to walk after eight o'clock in the dark at night anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So...and I don't know exactly how this was all done but I remember that I walked out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with my star on, and I was instructed at some point to take my little vest off and throw it into the uh gut...not in the <span class="DLF">gutter</span> ...it's in the uh...<span class="DLF">sewer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And for me that was just more fun....it's almost like you shed your identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And and I don't know if I walked alone or with my mother and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I have no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I kind of...I don't know what we took. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I... was asked if I took any toys or any books. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I think we went with a little bit of stuff and we went to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were into hiding, went into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Uh it appeared that my mother had already taken some paintings and her silver and her chinawear and some other stuff...had already...it had already disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">She had already taken care of it...it went into some <span class="NPIP">place</span> , hiding with some friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So we, my mother, my brother and I went to this first <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">It was in August of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Uh we had to go one flight up and there was a very small <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">It was a tiny little <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , a <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a closed-in <span class="DLF">porch</span> , a tiny little <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , and then the next...it was...it was 1n...uh the person who lived upstairs went on the same <span class="DLF">staircase</span> , uh the same <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> up to the next story. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">We got the <span class="INT_SPACE">back room</span> with the little <span class="DLF">porch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It was closed-in <span class="DLF">porch</span> , and everything was dark and heavily upholstered and curtains were drawn and there were kind of two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and I don't know what...and there we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And we were told that we had to whisper and we were told that we could not go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> as we wanted because the person upstairs would hear the flushing and there was three more people in the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> of Mrs. Noen and her son or and...she had a foster son __ (ph) so we had to be very quiet and uh actually do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Uh my brother right away got asthma attacks and uh he could not cough because the neighbors on the left and the neighbors on the...no...the neighbors upstairs and the shopkeepers downstairs could hear it, so he had to cough underneath his blanket and that didn't, you know, he didn't get any better so that was horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I mean it...you know, people have asthma and they almost, you know, choke and die and that was horrible because he was in a very dusty <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with the heavy, heavy upholstery, and and the curtains. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Uh and we were all, all three of us were thrown together and it was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">We didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">We tried to play games and it didn't work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Uh we invented all kinds of things and we kind of turned around each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">It was just absolutely horrible time. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Uh what happened was that the woman who hid us became extremely anxious. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">She couldn't sleep at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">She, she didn't know what to do with herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">She was so afraid that that she would be caught and instead of this plan that she had that she would go to <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> , she would be shot, you know, because she was hiding Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So her son concocted some kind of a plan to get us out and my mother...our contact person was a friend of my mother's who was not Jewish and that was our contact person from the outside world. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And actually we never kind of found out what happened exactly but we got a letter uh saying that some people knew where we were and we had to come up with some money and we had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Now the son had married...I guess he can live in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...had married and was...I had some little rings and some little jewelry. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">My mother had some and he had saved that for us and we never got it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Uh he also said he needed some money and we had to find some money and I don't know where my mother got the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">We had to give that to him for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">It was all very strange, but we were so powerless that we did everything they asked us to do and anyway the priest was contacted again and he found us another <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> and we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We were there from August whatever until November 29th of '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Uh we were, we had to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We had to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Now since we hadn't been <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for three months to walk out and to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley car</span> and to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was the most awful thing because you exposed yourself and we were so afraid we'd got caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">At the end of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride, which was very short, we were going to meet somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We didn't know who it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So we did that and we met this Mr. Faheine (ph) at, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Uh now what the good thing about this being black-mailed and and that whole story was that what we didn't know was that the lady who lived upstairs from where we were hiding had hid a whole lot of stuff for Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Chinawear, silver...not ours, somebody else's...and she was caught, so what happened was a couple of months after we had left, the Germans found out that she had stored stuff and came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , you know, looked over, you know, looked through all the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we had been hiding and upstairs and so actually that whole plan of this son to free his mother from all this anxiety was to our advantage because we would have been caught and we would not be here. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We uh we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> to this family and this man took us to his family and we found out that this was a family, a father, mother and seven children, and we all...the youngest child was two, and the oldest child was like eighteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you cannot believe how small the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was and he had promised that he would take us in for a while and we got some <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and there was no way that we could escape ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I mean it was all very small and all, all very tight. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">The <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were built very close together and we could not escape to the <span class="DLF">roof</span> or to the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">There was no escape here also. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We were there and we could not go too near the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">We could not flush the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">We could not walk really because downstairs they had a <span class="BUILDING">barber shop</span> and she had a <span class="BUILDING">beauty parlor</span> downstairs, so we were not supposed to be really there so we couldn't do anything uh so you had to kind of walk on your stocking feet and you couldn't really go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> because it was too much flushing. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Uh it would all be suspicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">We could not be near the <span class="DLF">window</span> because the <span class="DLF">streets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> are very narrow and the people across the <span class="DLF">street</span> could just see you. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Just, you know, so that was also not the best <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Uh the man who hid us, Mr. Faheine (ph), was an extraordinary man because on Sundays, three more Jewish men came, would come to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They were hiding somewhere in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> and he would kind of bring them 1n and have a Sunday meal and then there was some uh...and you know, it was all very small but he kind of wanted to help these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Uh we didn't know these people, but you know, they were...other people were hiding them. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Now one of these three men we found out while we were there that he was caught uh traveling and was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Uh the other two men we don't know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Uh the seven children never let anybody know that we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Now they went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , right, they went...and I don't think they were told, you know, specifically that they don't tell anyone that, you know, we have people in hiding here. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">They kind of knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Uh...I'm trying to think a little bit what happened there...all kinds of things happened uh uh while we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Now this was from like say December of...December '42 until May '45 we were there, so during that time uh things happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> such as uh...I don't think I can recall logically, but uh the Germans were looking for blankets, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="179">They needed blankets for I don't know for what and so we heard that they would come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , right, and search the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Now as soon as something like that came through we had to go somewhere, or they would, we would hear that all men over sixteen would have to go to workcamps and so in that family my brother was over sixteen and two more were over sixteen years old so they would...we had to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">All the time something like that would happen and we had to find a solution and not be with...this family had to find a solution for us, so one time we stayed for three days in a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">The <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> was around the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Early in the morning we would walk to the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> , sit through the mass, stay in a in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Every Mass that was we went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">We had pennies, you know, to put in and and that was for us kind of, you know, it was like a beautiful show because it was music and colorful and and...and it was spacious and uh we felt we would not be caught there. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">For some reason that was neutral ground and we wouldn't be caught there. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">One time...I forgot what the reason was...we had to also leave that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we would, and I I forgot what the reason was...we had to stay with people uh also two blocks away. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Now what we did during the time that we were hiding, we would knit a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">My mother would knit socks for the whole family and so while we had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and went two blocks away to another family, she took her knitting along but very close to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> she lost the yarn, So we walked and the yarn unwound and, you know, the whole <span class="DLF">path</span> with the yarn behind her (laughter) and we found it very funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Anyway we...she...[ don't know...retrieved it, but, you know, it was like...and we stayed with a young family and with that young family there was also a Jew hiding from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , an investment banker, and for us that was like wonderful because we had some other people to talk to and somebody who was in the same position we were in and uh uh it was kind of a diversion from the usual life we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Uh I don't know how long we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Not very long, and we went back again. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Another time they were looking for a man who was sixteen years old and my uh brother and the other two males would go to another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they had built a uh fake <span class="DLF">wall</span> , and what they would do if the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> would be searched, the men would go behind the fake <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Now, again my brother went and he thought it was terrific because you could go somewhere else and he played cards and until there was, you know, there was a sign that they had to hide and these kind of diversions were kind of a relief for our, you know, just staying in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and not doing very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Uh we did some cooking and some sewing and some knitting and some playing Monopoly and... playing a lot of Monopoly. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I know that that we were not as tense in that family as in the previous family because there was a little bit more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a little bit more uh...there were more people so we had uh but the woman we were hiding with, Mrs. _, was also extremely anxious. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I mean you just can't imagine if we would be caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Her husband would be...who knows, you know, so she was extremely anxious and she became sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I mean she really became sick...physical illness but I think it was probably uh due to some of the anxiety that she experienced in fearing that that something might happen to her whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">She was sick for months, so...and she had really no <span class="NPIP">place</span> ...it was such a small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and she way lying 1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">It was horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Uh now in that family, only two of their relatives knew that we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Her sister and his brother, and nobody else knew that we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Now in the Dutch families, on Sundays everybody gathers always on Sundays, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Sunday meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They just come by to say hello to every...Sunday was horrendous for us because we had to stay in an upstairs little room almost all Sunday and couldn't get out because the family was downstairs and they shouldn't see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Uh what happened uh...
QUESTION:  What did you do when you were up there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  I don't think very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I mean you either sat...we knitted maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">My brother...I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We didn't do very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We did read. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Uh but again we uh, the oldest daughter would go to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> for us, but she couldn't get enough books for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I mean we could read three books a day or, you know, easily, all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">But she would get just a few books, so we read. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We read. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">But there was never enough because we, you know, she couldn't get enough books and there were no books in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">There was no <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They were...the husband was a barber and she was a beautician. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">They were not educated people. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">There were no books in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> really, so we...I guess we played Monopoly. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">We read a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">We uh...I don't know, I can't...we did...my mother and I would peel potatoes, you know, and and clean vegetables and do some cooking and do darning and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">My brother had it much more difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Uh there was very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Uh we uh...my hiding father as we called him, would would get some food from the farmers because we were on the uh <span class="BUILDING">market</span> right there and since he was a barber the farmers would come for a shave, and he would do some dealing with them, so he would get some vegetables and some fresh potatoes and we would get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Also he was really remarkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">He loved to uh get...defy the authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I mean that was his whole task there. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I mean he loved it, so we had uh ration cards, but he had for everybody two, so we had...there were twelve fam...twelve people in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">He had twenty-four. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">So he, we had a little bit of more food than usual but still there was hardly any food in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and so there was a whole lot of tension about food in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because you cook for twelve people and and uh divide it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">It was very difficult and especially for the hiding mother because she had her own children and us and it was horrendous and they were all growing people, you know...they were all, like I said, from two to eighteen and I was like thirteen, fourteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">My brother was sixteen, seventeen. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I mean you could eat enormous amount of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">There was a lot of tension around food. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Uh what happened...I think in 1944...uh the hiding mother's youngest sister was pregnant and she needed some help and she asked me or my mother or somebody if I could help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">That meant that I had to go from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I was hiding to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and uh for me again it was something different, but I think you, you kind of learn to take a deep breathe and you walk and you hope nothing will happen, so I had to walk from the <span class="NPIP">place</span> I was hiding to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and then I slept overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I don't know how long it was, but I walked on the <span class="DLF">street</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I hadn't walked on the <span class="DLF">street</span> for a long time all by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And uh I stayed there and I don't know how long - maybe a few weeks or a few months and helped her, which was was a welcomed changed but there was also this fear that maybe my mother and my brother would be caught or that I would be caught, so...I mean...1t was very very tense is all I can say and very fearful. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I was always very fearful. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">The worst fear that I had, and I can't tell for my mother and my brother, that at night when there would be <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> coming through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , you would just lay in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and you would just wait and you always anticipated that that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> would stop in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> you were hiding in. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">The Germans would come out, bang on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and would get us, find us, and so <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were like you would just lying in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and if you heard some noise you kind of hold it, and since we had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to flee...most people, some people had, in their <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , had another <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> where they thought they would be safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">We had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Absolutely nothing to run to or to hide in. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So we were exposed and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Uh this didn't happen, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">But there were many instances that the Germans would come in the <span class="BUILDING">barber shop</span> and would ask for a shave and the man who hid us would have to shave the German soldiers and we would be upstairs and we would never know if they wanted to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> or not, you know, because the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> was upstairs, so uh I can't really tell you exactly how frightened we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I can't also tell you what we did because it's like one day was like the other and also you didn't really want to think because you would hear things. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">We would get some bits of information and uh they were all, like, you know, this man was caught and this man was caught and this family was caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">You would hear that and we didn't really want to believe it because we hoped it wasn't true and we would maybe be next. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">We did have false identity cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Uh we got them through another contact uh and again this was made uh so that we would...somehow we always felt guilty that somebody did something for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">What happened is people would come to us and they had in their rain...raincoats all the paraphernalia to make false identity cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Now uh they would come to us and they would go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and if they would be caught they would leave the raincoats there, but anyway they came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we were hiding and would...gave us the...they did the whole thing with the stamping and the fingerprints and the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">But it was always what if they were caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">It would be because of us, because they came to us to give us identity cards, and this really was like constantly that we would feel so guilty that people were helping us. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And that their lives was at...their lives were just uh in danger just like us and and everyone of them who knew about us, their life was in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Uh I remember that we didn't have any fuel and I was to go with one of the...two of the children go to the <span class="DLF">road</span> where there were little pieces of coal in the in the road deck (ph) and we would go there and I was asked also to go because...well, I would dress up like any little Dutch girl with a kerchief on and wooden shoes and we would go to the <span class="DLF">roadway</span> and find little pieces of coal so we could have some fuel for a very little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , so I could get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">My brother never got out because he was of the age that uh like, you know, they needed him in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Now one of the things that was...I'm glad that I remembered it...one of the most awful things happened in this family was that their oldest son was called up to go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And there we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We were hiding with them, and he had to make a decision to go or not to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">What meant was if he wasn't going to go, we had to leave because if he was going to go in hiding they were going to look for him and if he was going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work camp, we would be...they were not going to look for him, so we would be more or less safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">This man was a very religious Catholic and he decided that he was going to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And I don't know what date that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So he went and we stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And we had no dealing at all in his decision making but again we felt like he did it for us, because if he had decided not to go, we had to find another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and that was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So he went and they didn't get very much mail from him, so there was this constant kind of hanging over us - if he would die, he would die for us and and so we, you know, you put this all together...denial is a wonderful thing...so we kind of lived with it and everybody else was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Their daughter had married in the end of 1944, but all the other five children were there, so the daughter was married, he was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the five children were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">But he wasn't there, so we were daily reminded...Walter was his name...wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">He did come back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , but I always felt for years and years that guilt that I had sent him to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> and we did some corresponding and he said that part of his decision was adventure, but he suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Actually he never did very well after he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">He was like always extremely nervous and he retired early. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Now we don't know if it was due to his experience in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> and just like we don't know what our...if our our problems are because of the Holocaust or just maybe just, you know, problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">But I think his experiences in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> were horrendous and uh he he did come back, so that was...but the guilt of having...for him to make a decision to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> never left me, up until we corresponded, which was only a few years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Uh of course the whole thing with uh...we thought that autumn, that we would be liberated in September of 1944 and we weren't and we had had such big hopes that we would be liberated and we had to go through the whole winter which was the hunger winter in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> ...there was no food...and I think we were all pretty depressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Uh we would ask how long...when will it be over, and he would say, the hiding father would say to me, and another day would go by...how long is it going to take and he would say soon, so we kind of...you know...anyway the uh we were liberated in May the Sth. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">That winter was the most horrendous winter because people died of hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Uh we just made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">There was food until the last day and then the food was over (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Now I remember that I did not want to believe everyone that we were liberated because I did not want to be disappointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I didn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">They would say...you know, we we heard that we were going to be lib...that we were liberated in May and I said no, it's not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">It's not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I'm not going to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> because...and everybody was kind of flocking...you know,going <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Ah, we are liberated...and I...and they couldn't get me out because I...first of all I was afraid to go out but second of all I thought maybe if it isn't true, it's going to be worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So they had to kind of drag me out, to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and then there was, it was...we were uh really liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Uh we stayed for quite a few weeks in, with the family and then my mother found an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in in in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> and went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hague</span> where we originally lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Uh...uh...(pause) I can only tell tell you what happened afterwards a little bit is that my brother was...a couple of months later was drafted into the...was supposed to be drafted into the Dutch army to fight in <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> so here we had already joined a Zionist organization and he decided to go illegally to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> because he didn't want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> and fight or go into the Dutch army so my...we had been together for thirty-three months in very small <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> and my brother left, early '46 he left for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and we didn't see him for many years because, you know, we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for a few years. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Uh now my grandparents and my uncle went also into hiding in the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and they were in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and they were...they were caught the week before the end of the war, but the Germans didn't know what to do with them because they were in such a mess at that time and they put them in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in in nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and kind of left them there while they fled and so they were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So my uncle, my my uh my uh grandparents survived
