<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  I need you to start off by telling me your name, where you were born, what year you were born in, and your name as it was then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">My name is Rita Kerner Hilton. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in 1926, July 22, 1926. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> until I was six years old, seven years old, and then we moved to my mother's <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown Pomortsy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">This is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , exiled <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My grandfather was a practicing dentist there and since my mother was a dentist, they decided to practice together. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">That's where I lived until the war broke out and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your life growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  When I was a small girl, my parents were doing very well financially. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My father was a entrepreneur. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My mother wasn't working at that time, and we always had a maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I had a nanny when I was small. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">When we moved into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pomortsy</span> , my grandmother was running the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but she always had sleep-in help. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Since my mother worked in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , it was in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , I had a babysitter, or whoever it was, a part-time governess who'd come in after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> hours and do homework with me and read with me, take me out to the <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So, I had kind of a pampered existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I went to sleep-away camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> which was, you know, they were expensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So, I did have a very loving, a very pampered existence at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Were you particularly religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My grandfather strongly believed in reformed Judaism, which did not exist in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">They never kept a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We did observe holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We observed Passover, and he used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> on high holidays, sometimes would take me, but it was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">He strongly felt that if there would be a reformed Judaism then he could probably follow it. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">He could not follow the orthodox, the rabbis teachings, and argue with some of them about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  How integrated were you in the larger community? </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Were most of your friends Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Did you go to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Well, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , which was hard to get in, but this was the best -- I'm talking about <span class="BUILDING">primary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We lived in a so-called new section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , not the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> , a new section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">There were maybe about few Jewish kids there, mostly from the prominent families, doctors, lawyers and stuff like this, dentists. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And when I first came, I remember one of those days a kid called me a dirty Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I was a big girl, I was in first grade, and I gave a smack to the right and a smack to the left, and I never had any problem in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">When the time came to go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , there were three <span class="BUILDING">high schools</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">A <span class="BUILDING">girls' school</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">boys' school</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">German school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">This <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was very much German. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">There were a lot settled by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">They were <span class="BUILDING">German textile markets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">This was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">textile factory town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And they were having every year there were less Jewish kids accepted there. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">You had to pass an exam, and you had to be the top of the top of the top to get into that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">If you couldn't get in, you had to commute to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , which was a 45 minute ride by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">You had to go to <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> then which was costly. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Well, I got into that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And again the first few days someone said something about being a Jew, but the principal of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , she was very anti-semitic, but she was very fair, and she did not stand for any discrimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And again, I had no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I had a bunch of friends, but little by little, I mean, there was one girl, later on, she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with me, Alena, and we used to fight like cats and dogs, but at the same time we were the only Jewish kids in the same level, Jewish girls on that level. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The year before they accepted I think three or four or five. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Our year they accepted three, the following year they accepted two. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">The boys had a harder time in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">There were a couple boys who were sons of prominent doctor and they took his penis and dipped it in ink, and also there was a doctor upstairs, a friend of my parents, they had a younger kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He started going to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that I did, but they taunted him and he started losing clumps of hair from nervousness, and they had to place him in <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">The <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> were <span class="BUILDING">state schools</span> , but the principals, the teachers, the kids were Jewish, and there were two <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">One was the better one, and the other one wasn't so good. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But still, in order to get to the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , if you came from the <span class="BUILDING">Polish school</span> , your chances of getting into the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> were much better than if you came from the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">You know, separated, but equal. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And I had, as I said, had not too much problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Were there social and cultural activities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  At one time I know my mother used to go to all those fancy charity balls, a lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And I think closer to the war, there were a couple Jewish charity balls. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I think she still used to go to the Red Cross ball and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">But there were less social contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">My mother had a friend, a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friend, who was of a German decent, a very, very prominent family. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They owned big <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , and she married a Polish boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">They were patients for years and years and years. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">They used to socialize, and then closer to the war, that dried out. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We didn't have those contacts as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  So, let's talk a little bit about how things started to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Were you aware of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">My aunt lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">They came to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They knew it was coming on. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Also, there was a group of Polish people who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , never had their German passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">They were never citizens, and in 1937, they all sent them out and we used to collect money for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We used to give them meals and so on, because they were thrown out from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> without anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So, we were aware very much of what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">But no one believed it was going to happen, what happened, because during the first World War, the Germans were the better friends than the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">People did not like Russians in this part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So, we were aware, but we never thought they would destroy us all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  What happened when the Germans occupied your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  One of the first actions they put a bunch of restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">We couldn't use the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We couldn't use the <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> downstairs where everybody used to sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">No Jews were allowed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We couldn't go to the <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88"><span class="BUILDING">Schools</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I don't know when they told us to wear the -- before the stars, I think we had to wear the yellow armbands. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">There were scenes downstairs, I see through the <span class="DLF">window</span> that they would grab a Jew witha —_—_ and cut the and cut the beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And usually it was young kids doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">The Hitler Youth were like a bunch of little puppies jumping on. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">This was the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Then they started -- see we knew we would not be able to stay in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">This was a fancy section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and it was a very large <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">What has happened was a crazy situation and part of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> someone sublet it, it was a subleased to people who owned the <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They were German Nationals. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And they requested that section. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">So, we managed to get some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> out because we were evacuated not by the Germans, but by this owner of the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">cafe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So, my mother got out some of her extra, one extra <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and a foot drill and some equipment and we got some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> from that part of the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> out, and we have hidden it. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Some Pole took it for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And we did manage to get some valuables out, which eventually we left with the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">We never saw it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But at that time we -- and we kind of waited, when they are going to kick us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And sure enough, the order came in 24 hours we had to leave beddings for 12 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">china</span> , all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , all the equipment in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Everything had to be left. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We were allowed only to take our personal clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">That's when we moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">That Pole he promised us it would be out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , a little <span class="REGION">suburban area</span> , very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Nothing will happen to us, and then he -- the Jews were not allowed to have money, "X" amount of German marks, no gold, no silver, no diamonds, and when they started talking about forming the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> in he persuaded my grandfather that he's going to save for safekeeping, he'll take all his valuables. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And Grandfather had all his money in a gold money belt. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">His total life savings were in those gold coins. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">American dollars, British sterling pounds, everything in gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So, he left it with the Pole, and after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was formed, we couldn't get out, but we sent someone to pick it up, and he denied that he had ever had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">We never saw that stuff again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Did that surprise you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  At that time, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">At that time, he was so -- seemed like my father knew him and we knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We stayed with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We paid rent, but we stayed with him for a couple of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">There was also a situation where we wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">My mother decided to smuggle herself, smugglers and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">She had some fabrics she felt she'll take it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and sell it maybe live on it for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Our relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> wanted ut to move there. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">They felt that this was not German, this was the protector at this part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So, she went. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">She had a fur coat, and covered in fabric and went and was stopped somewhere and all the smuggled goods were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We didn't know what happened, but they let them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">This was a put up. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">They just wanted to get the goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So, a few days later she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , luckily for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Now, I'd like to get a sense of the mood when the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Were people fearful? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Were people being abused?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The fear was when we were all running to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> before the Germans came. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I don't think people were so fearful. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">It's hard to say how they felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We all didn't know what would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">By 11th of November, this is a Polish holiday, and just before they arrested all the prominent people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , not only Jews, they arrested Poles, they arrested anyone, teachers, lawyers, bankers, whoever had any prominence so they couldn't start any uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They wouldn't stir the population against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And we never saw them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Some of the Poles were let out. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Some Poles were let out, but --
QUESTION:  You don't know what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And then, as I said, it was winter, I think it was March, maybe February, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was formed, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  1940?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And we didn't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">There was my grandmother's sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">She had a three or four bedroom apartment. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">By that time, there were two other families living in part of that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and we wound up in a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Some other relatives were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">It was just bedlam. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Finally, we found out that there was a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that belonged to a pharmacist, a Polish pharmacist, and they told he has to get out of his <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So, we shared that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with a few other families, and that's where Mom opened up the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , reopened her <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">This was an open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">There were no wires, no <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> , just check points. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Jewish police were watching it. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">The Poles and the Germans would come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">If they didn't know you, you could get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I had a friend who would go out, but no one knew him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">But I couldn't get out because they knew me, and I could never step my foot out, <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was on two sides of that little section. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">There was a main <span class="DLF">street</span> going through with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> , so we had certain hours we could walk through, walk across the main <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">You could walk across in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">You could cross 1n the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Once you went on the one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , you couldn't go back until the hour came that you could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They formed a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">They started having German army coats made, and money was coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">There were various people who were in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , and there was one so-called revolution after another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">One group would kick them out and get other ones, with the help of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Personally, our family, my mother was having a lot of patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">There were no Polish dentists in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so her patients would come in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  Polish people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We had access to food. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">We had access to a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">She was making money, and she was helping the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">She had aunts and uncles and she was supporting everybody at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I worked with my grandfather in an <span class="BUILDING">outpatient clinic</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  This was a <span class="BUILDING">dental clinic</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Grandfather before he became a dentist, he was something you called a feltcher (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It's almost like a medic. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">My grandfather was doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">My grandfather was doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So, he was very well educated in medicine basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Never became a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And there was a need for an <span class="BUILDING">outpatient clinic</span> , so this was free of charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">He opened it up under the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> of the Jewish government, and I worked with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">The afternoons I had tutors, and my mother was very anxious for me to finish my -- somehow not to lose my years of education, so in the afternoon I had a tutor and was doing the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> program as much as we could, but at least I had somewhat. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I wasn't left completely wild.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  Tell me about the organization of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Who was preventing you from coming and going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">ANSWER:  There was a so-called Jewish , originally there was one lawyer in charge of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">There was a bunch of people who took over, and there were all kinds of unsavory things. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Unsavory in terms of there were rations coming in, the food was coming in, and I think they were selling it in the <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">There was another group denounced them. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Eventually they were arrested and some of them were hanged later in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">There was a Jewish police, but they were strictly order police. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I don't think they wore hats. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They just wore arm bands. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">They were watching all the end <span class="DLF">streets</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and the <span class="DLF">crossing streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">We had a whole little government which was running with the understanding of the Germans and they were dealing with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">The food and everything else was going through that group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  This group was corrupt?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  How did people get chosen for these duties?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I think they just got a group of people together and went to the Germans and what they did, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">This third group they were a couple of brothers and someone else, and they denounced the second group as corrupt, because I guess they got wind of what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">QUESTION:  Were there any women in positions of responsibility?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">ANSWER:  I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Not at that time, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  Do you remember how you all felt about these Jewish police taking orders from the German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  Well, they were not really taking orders from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They had to do a job and there were friends among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I mean, they were not in any way abusing people or killing people, or hitting people. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They were just standing there and wouldn't let you go. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">The Germans and the Poles could come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , and they told you not to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">This is the <span class="DLF">border</span> , this is the <span class="DLF">line</span> , you can't cross the <span class="DLF">line</span> , period.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="225">QUESTION:  Did they have any other responsibilities like <span class="BUILDING">organizational schools</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  No, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , there was absolutely nothing, no <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">The only thing we had organized, they organized a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">It was an old <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and we organized it as a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="229">We had a bunch of fundraisers, which were like reviews, and people volunteered to entertain and perform and we would all go to the shows and that would raise money for the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">But that was the extent of this cultural events.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  Now, you said your mother worked and she had outside patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Did you have enough to eat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">My family, at that time, we had too much to eat, because we had access to everything at much lower prices than the real <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Those items were on the <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> , but we were going directly from the Poles to us as I guess going to some middle man in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So, we did have enough to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Grandma again, had a little girl who helped run this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and as a result my mother was supporting that family, and the tutor's family, and she had two aunts and one uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">She was supporting them, giving them money so they could buy their food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">QUESTION:  Were times hard for other people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , or was this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> not too severe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">ANSWER:  No, it wasn't too severed. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">But it was, like those two women who were teaching me, there were two sisters that lived with their mother, and they had absolutely no way of getting any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">They were tutoring me and they were tutoring my other friends, so that was their main way of making money. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">My mother gave orders that when they came in the afternoon, we served a little snack. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I didn't need a snack, but by serving some little sandwiches or something the tutor could eat and she didn't have to eat <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">So, there were ways of helping people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  Was your sense for other people, was there food rationing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  There was rationing. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">There was a <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">There was rationing, but again it was not so bad like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I mean, people survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">No one starved to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">The Jewish administration, I think they had some kind of a welfare department because Mom was taking in any patient who couldn't pay, Jewish patient, would get a slip from the department and they would come in and she treated them free. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">She'd never take any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I mean people had money, but that was something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">But if they didn't, they were all treated for free.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  Were most people in the Ghetto working, older people or not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">That <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> lasted about two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">People still had things. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">People were selling things. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">They were selling linens. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">They were selling, if they had any jewelry, they were selling, so I don't think at that time, and look, I was a young girl, and I was concerned with working and meeting boys later and so on, and doing some school work, so maybe I did not delve into that too deeply.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  So, you were still doing all of those things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  I was still doing all of those things until the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was closed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  Now, how at this point you had really lost touch with all of your non-Jewish friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  All right, there was an interesting encounter I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">In <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , we had one girl who was of German decent, and as before they would taunt Jewish girls, the year before the war, they started taunting her. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">We would not go to the -- they had catholic classes in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">The priest would come in and teach them catholic, you know, the religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">So, we were excused for the hour and the three of us, there was another girl and we used to sit in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cafeteria</span> and just sit and kill an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">They used to send once a week a Jewish teacher to teach all of the Jewish girls, the Jewish religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So, the kids would taunt her, and I was one of the few people who were friendly with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And I met her one day in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , she worked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , and I was shocked because she hugged me and kissed me on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Her family declared themselves Tolstoy, you know, the German Nationalist. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And she gave me a big greeting, and I was very much surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">But you see, I took her part and defended her against the Polish girls before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">But that was the only contact I had with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I mentioned that woman who was my mother's friend, she married a Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">When the war broke out they were in the textile business like everybody else in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and Mom decided to invest some money in some wool clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Because we figured that during the war the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> will be closed, then that will be worth more money, but she left the fabric -- I mean I don't know how many bolts of fabric she bought, she left if with that family, with him and his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">When it came the time that she wanted to sell it, he was the only one who came with the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">She sent him a message and within a few days, and this was a nice profit, because naturally that thing increased in value and we got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We got the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So, he was one of the few. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">He was good and he was honest and he didn't look to take the stuff and not to deliver.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  So, it sounds like in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> you were able to carry on somewhat of a normal existence?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  Basically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  It didn't change things, but you were still able to eat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">ANSWER:  In my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">QUESTION:  And there weren't too many rough restrictions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  Well, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">We had every once in a while the Germans would come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">There were restrictions where you couldn't have certain metals and precious metals and then they started raids, and it was just wild. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">They would come in from all <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , line up, the ones with the brown shirts and the red armbands, they were lined up at arms lengths, they even took the boy scouts, the Hitler Youth, they lined up and they would go from <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> from <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and looking for furs and looking for metals and naturally silver. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">But even cooper and pewter, whatever metals they could melt. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">There were several incidents like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">They were also at one time, they wanted to evacuate Jewish youngsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">They were looking -- my mother got hold of -- I mean she knew about it a few days before, and I was hidden and some Jewish woman came with the Germans and said there is a young girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I said I'm in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  Local businesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">There was a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> and shoemakers and things like this, but no business as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Once they established the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , they were making money. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">They were paying them money, the operators. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">That brought some income to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> under ;
QUESTION:  I want to back track for a second because I forgot to ask you about how before the Germans arrived in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> starting to prepare for that possibility?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I really don't know what way they did and whether they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">There were a lot of people like the doctor upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">There were Polish, in the Polish army officers, there were Jewish officers, and they were drafted and they went with the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Most of them, they wound up in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> or many of them went up in . </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We don't know who killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I think the Germans, but the Germans were blaming the Russians, and the Russians were blaming the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But this was most of the Polish army was destroyed there, the officers.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  This was when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  May of '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">In fact, the 15th or 16th of May because my friend, Alena had a birthday that date. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">They announced -- first of all there was a group of men who will be working in those <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">coat factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">They will stay for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">They selected a group of people who would stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> and clean it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And they needed medical person also. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">There was a doctor and he was old and he was a bachelor, and he had a sister who was a dentist, and they volunteered to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Our family was ordered to go to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , because there were a lot of patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">The population was told to bring all the <span class="BUILDING">infirm</span> , all the sick ones, all the very old ones to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So, on a given day, and we were allowed to just take what we had on our backs and those bundles. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">We wore a few layers of clothes and we went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">On the given day, when we got to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , we were told that there 1s an <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span> somewhere so we carried the patients, whoever was left, and this <span class="NPIP">place</span> was filled to the rafters because they brought everybody who was in any way infirm there. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">That first day, they marched the whole population to that <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> , which was actually at the other end of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And we have been in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> that night, so we haven't seen what happened, but we were told what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">As they approached the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> there was an <span class="REGION">area</span> which was like fenced off which was before you entered actually the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">They started separating the parents, the old ones, and they started taking the children away. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">All the children under ten years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I was told that they threw a baby over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and said we don't need such . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Smashed child's, baby's head on a <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">They took them all to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">They grabbed a bunch of boys, young fellows and they took them to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">That night, they took all the women who were left to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">The following day they came to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and the group which came were the same boys and they were friends of ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">They were my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I knew them. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">They told us that they were putting people into those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and then they took the women to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> and just the men are left in the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">They were the ones who carried the patients to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorries</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> really, and they announced who couldn't walk should go on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lorry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And my grandmother felt that she couldn't walk all the way down. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">So, we had kind of a touchy moment because we walked through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">I think this was Sunday, because a lot of people were there and some of them would make the sign of a cross when they recognized us, and the whole personnel was walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">There was one woman who was hiding a kid in her backpack and she was walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">She wouldn't go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , and when we reached shortly before we reached the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> , you had to turn left at the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> was straight ahead and all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> with the patients went straight, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with the boys went straight and then we kind of froze for a minute, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> with my grandmother and other people went leftward to the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So, they were with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">That night and a man told us again about these awful, awful scenes which took place -- I think that out of population of 8,000 finally 3,000, 3,500 wound up in large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">That night they took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> stopped running about midnight, and that's when they were taking us all to large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">That second day, were just men and group from <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">QUESTION:  And the children who hadn't been evacuated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  Well, I don't think there were too many children at that time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  Conditions are horrid. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">We had this one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , which was our <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , our <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , our <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">The first few nights, Mom and I slept on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattress</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and mice came in and started running on our faces, so we had to give this up. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So, we shared one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and Grandma had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cot</span> , and Grandfather had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">We all worked. , </span><span class="sentence" id="425">who was the head of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> , didn't like dentists, so she worked as a nurse in one of the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I worked in a <span class="BUILDING">brassiere factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Grandfather was working also like a male nurse in one of the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Grandma got a job, old ladies were sorting rags and making bowls out of those colored rags, and eventually some younger women were knitting rugs for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">The problem was that the rags were full of lice and they were sorting them on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wire tables</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">So, she was bringing the lice <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">When they give us rations, you have to pick up the rations, the first day because very often they would run out of the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I think there were 750 to 900 calories a day what we were getting at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And just before the winter they decided to give us rations for the whole winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Our wood and coal and turnips and potatoes and cabbage and beets. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">So, we had to go and pick it up at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Mom and I would stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">The only way to pick this up was to put it on a sack and put it on your shoulders and carry it. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">You wouldn't let anyone carry it, because they would disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">We had four people, so we sometimes had to do it in four installments, four nights in a row to pick up that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">On the one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> we had the coal and the wood, and on the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> we had all the potatoes and cabbage and we had the inventory. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">We knew how many months it was supposed to last, and every couple of nights we would check which potatoes were getting rotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And this is the potatoes we ate because we knew it had to last for the whole winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">We also got bread, a loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">So, again, we cut up the bread in sections and little slices so we had for breakfast a piece and for lunch a piece and for dinner a piece and so we were not- we were always hungry, but some people would eat the bread on the first day or the second day and they were starving the rest of the week. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And what else we did, we all got some kind of a -- we didn't make anything warm to drink in the morning but you could buy hot water or coffee, so Grandma was going later to work so she volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Then she started tripping on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and falling down. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">She would come with a bloody face, whether she was weak or whether she had pressure too long, we don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So, we gave that up. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">During the day we all got soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">If you worked, you got the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And you had to work because you would get the money, the German money. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">The , they were named after Mr. who was the absolute tyrant in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And then at night we made a little something to eat, from whatever we had, whatever rations we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">If we had any vegetables we made it a little bit thick with any starches or whatever they give us. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">This was the existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Cold miserable and we all started getting sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I was getting abscesses on my face and sties in my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Grandfather fell on ice and broke his arm, and he started staying in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Grandmother had those dizzy spells, and we just tried to exist, and this was two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  Did you have much contact with people outside of your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">At work, you work. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I had a boyfriend, and we used to walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> because he had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, and I had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, so it was cold and we used to walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and talk.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">QUESTION:  Were there curfews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="465">ANSWER:  I think there were curfews. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I'm sure there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">We didn't walk at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">We walked on a Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">It was a day off, so we walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Towards the very end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , I got a job in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , in the <span class="DLF">vegetable fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">There were two kinds of police in the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">There was this regular order police. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">They watched the <span class="DLF">exits</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">They watch order and stuff like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And there was so-called commando. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">The head of commando was someone called Mark Kleeger (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Those bunch of thugs, they would get orders from Germans to deliver diamonds or deliver or find gold among the Jews, but they were nasty. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They would come into someone's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> looking for this stuff, and naturally they figure out the person would hide the stuff in sugar or flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So, instead of taking a plate or a bowl, they would just dump everything out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> looking for the valuables. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">They were in charge of the <span class="DLF">fields</span> where they distributed the vegetables. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I mean, so if you knew someone and we knew someone and they were there and they put the finger on the scale a little bit or lifted the scale you could get a little bit more. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">They had special rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">They ate in special <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">They would buy their groceries in a special <span class="BUILDING">store</span> like all the others of ;
QUESTION:  These were Jewish police?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  That was Jewish police. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And as I said, he had those <span class="DLF">fields</span> out near the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">He established <span class="DLF">vegetable fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We had people working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And I was getting sick and through connections and through people I got the job in those <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">It was a hard labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">So, first of all you got two soups a day instead of one. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">I had to walk two or three miles to that <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but the fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I mean there was nothing much to do, the fresh air and the sun started drying up my face, and then we were working when we were weeding, we would take the weeds <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="494">They were a source of green vegetable. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">When we were thinning out radishes, we would eat raw radishes. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">That they couldn't catch us, but when we were doing something with the weeds, weeding the weeds, we used to eat the raw bean and put the greens back into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> so they couldn't figure out who was eating them. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">We weren't really stealing, we were just hungry so we'd eat a bean. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">But that helped me later on to survive the rest of it, because all of a sudden my health improved so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And because I was getting two soups a day, I didn't have to each so much at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I was getting the extra soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I would bring it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at night so we had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And my grandfather was getting weaker and weaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">He couldn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">This was really awful, so we kept on saving his bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And his wish was to live so long that we can pick up his rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">This was his inheritance because he said he lost all his gold, he can't leave us anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">What we did he died the day before the rations came, and we didn't report it until the following day, we picked it up and then I reported the death, so we had this extra little food and an extra loaf of bread, which later I left 1f in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because we're still hoarding and we're still afraid to let go and eat everything a once. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But the existence in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">They also had the criminal police, , this was German police. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">They had their <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in a little <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and they would call people in and say what do you have? </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Our landlord, he was the head of <span class="DLF">fences</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">A real, very unsavory character, but he had a heart of gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And he must have had money. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">They beat him to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">They let him out, he died a day later. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">But he was like -- his face was like liver. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">He never told them what he had. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">They called my mother in. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">They said we heard you are a rich dentist from . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">What do you have? </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And she said, "Well, I have a couple of gold chains, I have a little diamond." </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And they said, bring it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">So, she brought it in and they let her go. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So, they were satisfied. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">If she would have said she had nothing, they would have tortured her. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">This between the and the Jews under commando, this was pretty tight situation over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And then they started evacuations. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">They were evacuating constantly people. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">One of the worst actions was when they took the children out. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Orders came that they have to take the children, they're going to take them to better <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="531">There will be fresh air and <span class="DLF">farms</span> and the people put signs on it and they mobilized all the Jewish police including all the people who worked for the health department, including my mother, and they had to go and collect the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">The children were being taken voluntarily by the parents, taken down, because they couldn't hide them. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">The moment the family would hide a child, the rations would be taken away, so not only the child didn't have the rations, but the family wouldn't have the rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Our next door neighbors had hidden a child and they struggled. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Unfortunately she died later, but it was -- and then they were taking the old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">They would make you line up on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and get out and just select the old people and the children Now, one of the worst actions was around the Jewish holidays, this was '44, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And we lived on the corner, and the lady the one who was our so-called landlady, she was the wife of the guy who was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Before the war she was in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So, we started lining up on one <span class="DLF">street</span> and she called everybody up and she said forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">This is not our <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Our address is the next <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">There were two <span class="DLF">entrances</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">She said, all of you go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Just sit quiet, don't open the <span class="DLF">window</span> , don't stand next to <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">At that time she had hidden some children and my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">We didn't know where they were, somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">They had all kinds of nooks and crannies in that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and we had all hidden quietly, and at noon they rang the whistles and they stopped the action. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So, they were ready to call that second <span class="DLF">street</span> , where we were, they called it off, so we were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">If she would have -- we walked out and somebody said to us, someone who knew us and said, where are your parents, and my mother said, hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">He said, that's silly, they'll find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">They'll kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And he was not sure about mom, but when we went back, like I said, that action was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I mean stopped, and that's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  Were you all sort of fatalistic about this? </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Was it terrifying to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">ANSWER:  It was terrifying. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">You didn't know what's going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Some friends of my mother's he was high official, she had her parents, and they went down when the <span class="DLF">street</span> went down, and he told that he'll be able to release them because he was a very, very high position, and he could never do anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">They took him. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">They started having lists and first I knew I was not on the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">One of my grandmother's sister was on the list, and we tried to get her out, and my friend told her to go, because there was no -- you couldn't support them. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">You couldn't do anything with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Once they were on the list, the rations were cancelled. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">So, who could afford to feed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So, they took her, and my grandmother had one brother and two sisters in large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">One of the sister-in-laws died, two children were evacuated, one uncle was evacuated, the girl finally , and she died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">The other aunt, they took them away and we never heard of them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">The woman, the last one's husband was either taken away or died, and she was the last one who was evacuated before our family was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">So, they all were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I mean, there were relatives in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , but we never knew what happened to them, but those I knew until '43 what happened to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">QUESTION:  Now, I want to know a little bit more to the organization of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I know there were Jewish police.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">ANSWER:  Well, the organization was the head of the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">QUESTION:  Did you have any contact with him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  No, he slapped my mother's face once, because he thought she was peddling something on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and he was going in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> and there was a peddlar and she ran into our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and my mother was working in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and he ran after her and slapped her face. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">At one time I wanted to get a petition, when I had those abscesses, for some different job. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">I never got into him. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I never had any contact with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">He had his own clique. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">His brother, we called Prince Joseph, after Napoleon's brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">They all had good <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">They had special rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">They all wore high boots like the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">They all rode in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> with the horses, and he thought he was a king. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">The money was-the only money we could use in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> were pictures on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">We called it . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">That was the only way you could buy anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">He liked the doctors, he didn't like the dentists, so the dentists were person non grata.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  Your mother didn't practice dentistry at all in the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  All right, we'll get to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I'll let you finish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">ANSWER:  If someone displeased him, he would just send them out, either send them out on transport or if someone did something which was according to his rules not right, maybe abuses, they were assigned to the feces brigade. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And this was the most horrid thing you ever saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">They would collect, there were <span class="DLF">cesspools</span> , so they would collect the feces from the <span class="DLF">cesspool</span> in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> 1n special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">But those people were pulling those things, and they had to empty them somewhere in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">I remember there was a young couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I don't know what he did, and they punished him. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">She was a beautiful blonde and she used to pull that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">They were covered with feces. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Naturally a lot of those feces were full of disease, so those people never lasted too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">You probably know the landmark of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was everybody carried a little <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> to work because we got our soup in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So we all carried it. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">As a matter fact, I got as a birthday present, someone made one that was not made out of tin but made some nice metal so that it didn't have that tinny taste, because the soup would get soured in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Even those people who pulled those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">feces wagons</span> , they would walk around with their bowl or their canteens attached to their belts because somehow on their route they would stop and wherever and they would get their soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So, as filthy and dirty and miserable as they were, they ate on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">But those people really, this was like he punished them. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">This was worse punishment I think than being evacuated on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I also had a hard time with grandfather when he was dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">We had cold water only. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">We had to pump the water downstairs to bring it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And they had <span class="BUILDING">laundries</span> , <span class="BUILDING">public laundries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">You sent out your stuff, took three months, two months you got it back. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Not that we had valuable things. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">They gave us things out when we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Well, Grandfather was sick towards the end and he had uremia, and he had accidents, and 1n order to change the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> I had to pick him up and put him on another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">We'd change the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and finally when he died -- he wanted to commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">He had some procaine (ph) and his cousin caught him and he was ready to take it, but anyway, he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">In order to bury him, one had to provide two clean sheets for a shroud. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">We had no clean sheets. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So, I went to these friends of my mother's who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> before the war, and there were several families there that they all lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And that was the one who lost their parents, and I said, could you lend me two sheets so I can bury Grandfather and we will either buy some on the <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> later on, or we'll get our bundle and we'll give it back to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">She said, "No, I'm sorry, I don't have it." </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I was devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And finally the people next door who were new acquaintances, the ones who had lost the child, she knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">She said, "I hear you have a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Here are the two sheets." </span><span class="sentence" id="628">So, this is how we managed to bury him in clean sheets. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">This was towards the end of the war, and they felt that they are going to survive the war and they're going to have their linens and have everything else. </span><span class="sentence"

QUESTION:  I was mentioning that as far as I understand it, there was a lot of organization in the large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Cultural activities, little religious programs, <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  I have never attended any of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I don't know anything much. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">There was a <span class="BUILDING">private library</span> , and I used to go for books. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">The front was bordering the <span class="DLF">street</span> which was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">The main <span class="DLF">street</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">street cars</span> going like in . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">No one lived in those <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I think they had <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">There was barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">This was guarded by the Jewish policeman watching that no one should sneak out and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">That <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">private lending library</span> was on that <span class="DLF">street</span> , but I know we used to go through the back and stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> and borrow books. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">That's the only thing which I had in terms of cultural events. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">As I said, I was there for two years, and we had to take care of the old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">We had to bring the rations, and bring the food and do the fire and bring the water, and bring the slops down. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Everything was on my mother's and my back, and one time she had an infection in her finger, so she couldn't grab. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">She had an infection in her palm and she couldn't carry things. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">She would go with me to pick up the rations just to guard me and I was carrying it. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I worked, and as I said, Saturdays I would go out, and I met this guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I started going out with him on Saturdays. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">We would just walk, because he was taking care of his mother and sister-in-law and a child, and he was a policeman, but he was not doing anything how should I say, he didn't beat people. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">He was watching, I think he was a sergeant, but they call it in German " " that means people who kept the order. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">They were not the criminals and they were not the commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Those were the thugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">They are the ones who are the messy guys.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="656">QUESTION:  When you would take walks, what would you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  People very often, you saw people lying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">They found bodies on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">The children, they used to sell , and there were children, there was a little chant the little children would sell , and three for one mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">This was almost like a Ghetto song, those little children selling. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Children were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">My mother was working in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where children were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I don't know what jobs they had, sorting something putting something together. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">They were little children. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And I remember once she told a story about a little boy and he said he saw a goose, but he said it in Jewish and he says I saw a gants, not something whole a gants, he meant a goose and he started flapping with his wing and trying to say what the goose was. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And he saw a gants, and my mother said the eyes would dig because he saw an animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Even the little children, the ones who were finally eventually were evacuated, but at one time they had little <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Even they had to work to get a little soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Life was -- there were wives who fought with husbands about food. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">The husbands would threaten the wives or steal. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">People would steal the food from each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">People would sell the bread for cigarettes and then they were starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">It was so difficult to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Now, I was a young girl and I didn't have any clothing, and we used every piece of scrap of whatever we could do something to make something. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">When we first came in, they gave us some stuff, some linens, some pots and pans, because they had from other liquidated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> , they would get the stuff in and when people were brought in, that was the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">They would distribute some of the stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I remember we got this big grey shawl with fringes on it, full of holes. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And I ripped the shawl, I took out the fringes and pieced the whole thing together. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I think I made three hats for us, for mother, for grandmother and for me, because it was cold and some mittens. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">We grabbed things out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Among other things there was a piece of fabric. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I'll always remember it was an orange piece of fabric and I needed something. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And it was not enough for a dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I had a friend who was working with me and she was a dressmaker and she said find some wool. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So we found -- I found some on the <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> , some yarn, and she made me knit parts of the sleeves and the yoke and the turtleneck, and some trim on the skirt, she made like pockets, and I had a beautiful dress, I mean made out of very small piece of fabric and those scraps. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And the Polish peasant women never wore coats, even working women, they wear those big plaid throws, I mean like big squares. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">They were square. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">So, I was with Mom, we bought this plaid thing and made a jacket for me, because you had to I needed some clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I was outgrowing what I had, and I needed something. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">We managed as I say, things from scraps. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Every little scrap of wool, every piece of scrap of something, you pieced it. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">You bought pieces of wool and made a sweater. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">You're talking about people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> how short sighted they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">When I was working for that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">corset factory</span> , we would get this was for the German population, and Germans would send in cut out pieces of brassieres, I mean they were all cut, and all the fittings and the little hooks and buttons, whatever, slides for the brassieres or if we did corsets there were stays and eyelets, and we had to count everything and package it in small loads so we would distribute it to the <span class="DLF">assembly line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> where we would distribute. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">We even measured thread. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">We gave them certain amount of thread so no one could steal anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">The guy who was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was a manufacturer before the war, and he felt that the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> has to be run in the correct order. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">There were times we had absolutely nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">No shipment came. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">There was very little and the <span class="DLF">assembly line</span> was working very slowly and they would come in and they needed a dozen buttons, a dozen stays and we would just give them to the <span class="DLF">assembly line</span> , but the biggest work was when the shipments would come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">We had to count, like I say, every button and repackage it. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So, the foreman of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> used to say, "Whatever you're doing, just make believe you're working." </span><span class="sentence" id="704">So, we would have a book in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">drawer</span> and we'd knit under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> we would have button or stays open up a package and make believe we were counting or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">This guy would come in, you would have to hide from him because he did not believe, he could not bring himself to say, "Look girls, there is nothing to do." </span><span class="sentence" id="706">As long as the Germans don't come in and they don't catch you with it, he was petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">When the time came for me to get transferred to the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , I needed his release, and he wouldn't release. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">With all the connections I had to get to those <span class="DLF">fields</span> , he didn't want to lose one of his workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Finally, someone from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , who was also director of a more important <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , he was a director of the uniforms, the coats for the German Army, he finally approached him and said, "There's a young girl here. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">She's sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">She needs some fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">This dust in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> is killing her." </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I couldn't breath, I was having attacks of asthma. "</span><span class="sentence" id="714">Why don't you release her?" </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Finally, I got the release from him, but when I approached him he wouldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">There were many people like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">They were so self important. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">They felt so important, and they were nobodies nothings. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">All of a sudden they became heads of <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was one huge <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , starting from electronic equipment, uniforms, which was the most important things, boots, supplies for the Army, going down to the brassieres, hats, artificial flowers, brooms. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And even those rag rugs, braided rugs which were made out of scraps. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">They would take torn sheets which they would get from various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> when the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> were liquidated like in . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">That group saw that the good stuff went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or for the German settlers. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">The junk came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Some of the stuff was torn, they were rags. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">They would dye them different colors and make braided rugs out of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">So, everybody was working and everybody produced something, and we produced and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> was getting food. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">There was no money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">QUESTION:  How were these people selected to be in positions of authority whether it was the police or the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="730">ANSWER:  I don't know, connections, basically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">QUESTION:  Were there ever women in positions of authority?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">ANSWER:  I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I think so, I don't know how many, mostly a men's society. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">The guy Kleeger, the one who was the head of the commando, he had a brother who's the most extremely decent guy, and she was a friend of my mother's from before the war, and he was in charge -- this is a specialty of empty containers. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">You see, if they brought containers to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , let's say they brought brown sugar or they brought flour or something, that department would scrape out the things and there was still food in it and they had to return to those things back to the Germans to refill it. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">So, he was in charge of the empty containers. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">This was -- he had a high position, but he felt that this was a position which in any way he's not jeopardizing anyone's life and anyone's position. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">He wanted to survive, and he survived and his wife, but this was his job, and one day I told you when the commander, his brother's hoodlums were coming into the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , one day he was passing our <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> and he saw the guys were coming in to check, and he just walked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">My grandparents were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">He walked in and just sat down and talked to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">He was waiting for those guys to come and he wanted to chase them on their way. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">He felt they shouldn't anyway, he never said anything later, and they left the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and he later told my mother that he came in because my grandparents said "What was Simon doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="743">He just came to visit us in the middle of the day?" </span><span class="sentence" id="744">He came, he wanted to prevent any scenes with my grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">As I said, he was the most decent guy in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">His brother survived, I think, either brother or nephew. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">He was hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Those people survived that lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and we saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">There were a lot of decent people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">QUESTION:  There was also corruption?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">ANSWER:  I think there was corruption. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">There had to be corruption. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">There had to be corruption. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">You see, in large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> I was such a low level of living that I really don't know what was going on, but we know -- the whole administration and when I read this book about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> , one time he had <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> here and <span class="BUILDING">orphanages</span> , he had <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , he was making the famous speech, give me your children, he felt justified in sending out the children because maybe he can save some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">When finally it came to his evacuation, they gave him a special <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="756">He didn't go 1n a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> , and he expected that they were going to take him on an inspection of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and he's going to help them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And there are three theories what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">One was that some people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> killed him when he arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Some of them he was gassed or some German killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">So, we don't really know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">Now, once they evacuated us, the evacuation --see what happened, they were having more and more lists and more and more evacuations and they would grab people on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I was afraid to go anyplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And I had some money coming to me and some vegetables coming to me because the vegetables all of a sudden were ripening, and I was afraid to go by myself to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that I was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And this friend of mine, the policeman, he said he'll take me, because at least we hope they won't grab me on the <span class="DLF">street</span> when I'm being escorted. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">At that time, we knew something was going to happen, so we made this big out of some fabric back packs and packed all our valuables and some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">That was sitting ready to be taken in case they evacuate us. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">We never knew in the last few weeks of August, this was the beginning of August '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">He was late, and that in a way helped me and Mom be together, because by the time he arrived, they took us by that time they just blew the whistles everybody out. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">So, we went down, and downstairs he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">He just came. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">If he would have been 15 20 minutes before I would have left and I would have never been with my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I would have gone with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">So, he helped us to go to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> and that's where they put us in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">There were about 80 people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> and one bucket, one slop bucket. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I don't even know if there was anything to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">We all had something to eat, I mean whatever we grabbed. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">As I said, we had an extra bread which we never allowed ourselves to eat the whole bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">We're saving it because what happens tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">We were so conditioned to it that you have to save something for tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And Grandma was embarrassed to go in the bucket. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">She couldn't -- and we tried to cover her with the coat and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">People were dying on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">This was one night when I --
QUESTION:  I'm sorry to interrupt you but did you have any idea where people were being sent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">ANSWER:  No, there were all kinds of rumors but no one knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">QUESTION:  Had you heard about this before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">ANSWER:  We didn't hear of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">We heard about bad things happening, but the only time that I knew something was happening when those boys told us that the people were taken to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , the old people and the children, and those boys were never heard of again. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Back track, one of my friends was hung in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">He was found, he was trying to escape from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And this was a boy I saw him when I was 15, I gave him my photograph, and then somebody told me that he was hung, and they found my photograph with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Since that time, I was going up the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I had boyfriends who were much older than him, and I became obsessed to get that photograph back, because I felt if that boy felt that way that he had my photograph, it was taken when I was 12 or 13, before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I finally tracked that photograph down and had it, and I told you that the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> some of them were hung. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">The ones who were in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> at one time, which I mention it in my book. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">So, when we got -- what were we talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">QUESTION:  The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="798">ANSWER:  Yes, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">We arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and it was dark in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="800">All of the sudden the light was kind of blinding. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">They lined us all up in fives. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">We had my grandmother with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">They told us to leave this stuff whatever we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I just had like a little lunch bag, and I had my photographs there, and I had some money there, and a couple of rings and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Mother, I think had probably instruments. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">If anything, aside from anything else she had was instruments. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">She had a red cross arm band, because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> everybody was identified by something. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">They had caps and they had bands, and they had different hats with different 1.d.</span><span class="sentence" id="809">'s and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">was big on uniforms but couldn't afford uniforms, so he was giving people hats. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">As we were approaching , there were a lot of Polish couple, like trustees working there, the <span class="DLF">ramp</span> , and I didn't realize until later what this Pole did. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">He saved our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">What he did, is pushed me into the <span class="DLF">line</span> first and separated me from my mother and my grandmother and put some people in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Then he put my mother in, again, put some people in between, and then put my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">He knew where she was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">He wasn't sure where my mother was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">He knew where I am going. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And the family was together. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Very often they's say let me go with that loved one and they would oblige. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">So, naturally they send me in and then he asked my mother where she is going, and she saw the sign and she said I am going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">The sign was , SO She said I'm going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">He looked at her, clapped her on her behind and let her go. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And naturally, they send Grandmother to the left, and my mother had nightmares because it was so confusing that we didn't have a chance to look what happened to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">It was so fast, and so unbelievably confusing, and I think that the Pole by separating us, knew what he was doing and he saved us, the two of us.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="828">ANSWER:  There's a by word of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> "shnell (ph)" Everything they did you had to do fast, fast, fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">You had no time to regroup, you had no time think, you had no time to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , line up, fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">That's all you could hear "Shnell, shnell," When they finally regrouped us on the other side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , again they formed us in fives. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">There were groups of prisoner girls, and they started driving us, practically driving us, fast, running, and while we were running, we encountered a group of subhumans, to us at that time they were subhumans, they wore tops of men's pajamas, but they were not the regular prison garb. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">They all had their hair shaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">They had the wooden lace shoes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Their doppers (ph) were plastic or fabric or whatever, or no, they were wood sabits (ph) like Dutch shoes, because it was muddy around. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">There were sent in another direction, and they started yelling give me your bread, give me something, they'll take it away it from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Give it to us, and they were supervised by the Germans, but basically they were smacking them, and we were shocked seeing that group, and naturally wouldn't give them the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">I mean, God forbid, we had to hide the bread for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">We'll need it. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And finally they brought us into an <span class="REGION">area</span> where the <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> were. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">This was a real legitimate <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> , a processing area. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">By that time it was getting dark, and they warned us to turn in all the gold and all the diamonds and all the valuables that we have because they'll be taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">And rumors were going that they were going to do very personal inspections. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Well, Mom had a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> with two diamonds in. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">She had it made in such a way that she could take it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">The diamonds were taken out of the things and she had it in her mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">This was like a final ration in case we need anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And I was very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I got panicky and I said I don't want to give these Germans absolutely nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Let's bury them. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And I also had a couple of rings, old rings. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And in the dark, my mother says "Are you sure?" </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And I said Mom, I don't want you to give it to them and they are going to look in your mouth and they will find it and they will get, and I don't want them to have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And there we put into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , ground it with our heels, and got rid of the diamonds and got rid of the gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">There were a couple of other things they took, but this, it's like a feeling, like great we didn't give it to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">Anyway, they took us to this <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">QUESTION:  What happened to the diamonds?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">ANSWER:  She ground them into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="859">QUESTION:  Was that the end of the story with the diamonds?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">ANSWER:  Yes, but we wouldn't give it to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">That was fun --, when I think about it now, this was fun, because they didn't get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Maybe somebody eventually found it, maybe not. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">I don't care. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">They were sewed in a little plastic thing -- well, we didn't have plastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Anyway, they took us to the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="866">We had to get undressed, get the clothes off. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">They took everything away from us and they sent us to the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> and lucky for me, I don't know why, they didn't cut my hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">They did shave our hair and they give us tattoos. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">It was very late at night by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">They were getting a lot of transports. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Rumor was that they wanted us to -- eventually would have gassed us, but they were so busy, the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> was so busy that they felt maybe they can do something with us, the able bodied people. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And, they gave us some clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">I wound up with a skirt, my mother wound up with a mini, So we switched and the wooden shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Then the last act was they painted a stripe, a red stripe down our backs and that broke me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Talking about panic, and we walked naked in front of the guys, in front of the Germans and in front of Polish copos. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Somehow, I took this whole thing without shedding a tear, but when they painted that stripe on my back, I started crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Again, one of the Poles walked over to me, hugged me and said, "Don't worry, you'll survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">You'll be okay." </span><span class="sentence" id="879">I mean, I spoke Polish at that time fluently, and I was a pretty girl at that time, and he felt sorry for me so he said, "Don't worry, you'll make it, just don't cry." </span><span class="sentence" id="880">So, they sent us out, by now it's late at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">They didn't have a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">They'll send us to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="883">I don't know if you know what the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">They were concrete <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> with <span class="DLF">holes</span> that could accommodate 500 people at once. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> on both sides and then in the middle there was a long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> from back to back there were <span class="DLF">holes</span> with a <span class="DLF">pit</span> underneath. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And that's how we were using as <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Well, that's where we spent the night, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">toilets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Well, I don't have to repeat Auschwitz stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">We stood up from 5:00 in the morning or 6:00 in the morning and then they put us in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and we had 14 people, 12 to 14 people to one six by six or seven by seven <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="890">They gave us a can of whatever they gave us was in a metal can, no spoon, no nothing, and five people had to eat out of it, so everybody's watching how many swallows you did of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And one of the first nights there, once we got into the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , they were burning, the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> was going night and day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">QUESTION:  You knew what it was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="893">ANSWER:  We didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">But someone woke up and those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , like you see in the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> how they look, they had little <span class="DLF">windows</span> on top and someone must have woken up and saw this red glow in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> and someone started crying all of a sudden 1,000 women started crying and people who were in charge of it, group of Hungarian girls, they started yelling to be quiet because the Germans would come in and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">We still didn't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">We knew something bad had happened, but we didn't know about the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> , what's happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="897">QUESTION:  You didn't know what the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> were? </span><span class="sentence" id="898">How many people were in your <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="899">ANSWER:  About a thousand.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">QUESTION:  From all <span class="NPIP">over</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="901">ANSWER:  This was probably mostly Polish group run by the Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">The girls who were in charge had short skirts and they for some reason they all like polka dotted blouses and they had their hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">They cut my hair some more. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">They didn't like my having hair, so they shaved it a little -- they didn't shave it, but they cut it completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And Mom developed, we were afraid, because she developed from the wooden shoes a wound on her ankle and that was festering, and two weeks later they had the selection, luckily they put us through a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> again, and the paper bandage fell off, so when they selected her, they didn't see her with the bandage. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">As much as that was festering and messy, they didn't do anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="907">QUESTION:  Was your day fairly controlled?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="908">ANSWER:  Extremely. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">We had to get up, I don't know, 5:00 or 6:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">It was cold in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">You stood on that for hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">They counted, and counted first from the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , then they counted from the section, then they counted -- they had to count the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> through and had to tally. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">If someone died, they had to tally. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">If someone died, they had to tally. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">If they couldn't find someone, they were looking for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="916">QUESTION:  This is the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , not just your <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="917">ANSWER:  No, no, they started with counting the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , then there was a whole section, then they had to have it to one person, and if they couldn't find her they were looking for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">Somebody was maybe hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">Maybe someone died, maybe someone couldn't get up. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">It started over and over and over. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And the morning was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Then they would give us five minutes in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Sometimes they put us in one of the other <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was like a <span class="INT_SPACE">washroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="924">I don't know how many spigots, but again, it was fast, fast, fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">There was no toilet paper, there was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">You couldn't wash, you couldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">If you managed to put your hand under the spigot and get a little water, they gave us something in the morning, I don't know if they gave us bread at night or in the morning -- no, I think we used to get the bread at night and save a piece to have it for the morning, and they gave us some soup during the day and some kind of a liquid during the day, in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Once we were standing in the , and one of the girls, whatever she had she had some kind of a jacket with patch pockets, and I said, "Gee, that would be nice to have for bread." </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And she ripped out the pocket and said, "Here." </span><span class="sentence" id="930">She knew my mother from her <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , because we would save the piece of bread to have it for the morning, and you were afraid to put it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">You slept on top of the bread so God forbid someone shouldn't steal if from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">So, that pocket was a great thing to put the piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I mean, you know, such little things can mean so much to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Anyway, luckily for us we only stayed only two weeks there. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">This was <span class="NPIP">hell</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="936">QUESTION:  Did you work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Yes, I offered -- I couldn't sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Mom was doing something, checking some things. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">You know they asked who was a medical thing, so she would go down, and they made us sit in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and you couldn't lay down. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">You just had to sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">Fourteen people in one of those <span class="DLF">platforms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Well, I couldn't sleep at night with all the noise and at night they had the slop bucket at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and somebody had to go, they had to go to the slop bucket and when the slop bucket was full, had to be taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Well, I volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And one of the escort from one of the other girls, from one of the workers, but they felt themselves above carrying a slop bucket, and at least I could get some fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Walk, when the bucket was full, I could go walk out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">QUESTION:  Did you see anything strange when you'd walk out at night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">ANSWER:  Nothing, it was just dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">Nothing was seen, no one was walking, except as I said, figures taking the slop bucket. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">That's about all. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">No one was allowed to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="952">But, I was waiting for that occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="953">QUESTION:  It just sounds sort of eerie.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="954">ANSWER:  It was very hot in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">This was still August. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">So during the day, it got hot, and in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they would send us out again for another count, and by that time it was hot, and we stood there for hours until they tallied. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">It was a way of torture. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">They were just cruel and people were fainting and people were dying in the <span class="DLF">lines</span> and you were not allowed to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">You had to leave them the way they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">If someone passed out, they passed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">That's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="962">QUESTION:  You went out a night, did you see the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> flames or smell them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">ANSWER:  There was a small and there was dust, but we didn't -- there was some white stuff floating, but we didn't know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">The first night the glow was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And we were afraid, I don't know, we were afraid to do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">You were not allowed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Once I was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , maybe I wasn't moving fast enough, there was this famous Erma , She later came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , blonde, gorgeous cool and she had this big whip and she smacked me with a whip. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Because as I said, the whole ward was fast, whatever you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">You had to line up fast, you had to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">They gave you five minutes in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="971">Five minutes maybe not even five minutes to get some water to wash up, wash up, maybe you could wet your face maybe take a sip of water and wet your hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">That's about all. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Conditions were awful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">QUESTION:  How were the other guards, the copos, your block elders?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="975">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">It's hard to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">They lived very nicely, especially the block elders. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">They had little <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> with quilts and they had little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stoves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And one with the block elder she would help and then they had a whole bunch of lesser girls and -- our group was Hungarian so there was a communication gap. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">Some of them spoke German, some of us spoke German and some of us didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I didn't speak too well German, but I understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">So, you were afraid of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="983">QUESTION:  Were they nasty?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="984">ANSWER:  Sometimes, like I said with the hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">They couldn't stand the fact that I had hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">I mean I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">I had short hair, but they couldn't stand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">They didn't have a razor, so they clipped it and said that's to prevent lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">Because they saw some workers working on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , again Polish workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">I talked to them once. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">I don't know how I managed to say something, and I said I could use a stick, and he said fine, tomorrow we'll work on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> and I'll make you a stick for the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">It's like a tongue depressor and he dropped that stick for me, so I could dig into the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">They didn't like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">So, the following day, they called me down to the bottom of the thing and said, "We have to cut the hair." </span><span class="sentence" id="995">So, they cut some more. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">I had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">Because except for the block elders and their assistants the rest of them had shaved heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">How they got there, how they became them, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">There was a woman who came along, she was a dentist from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and she kind of asked my mother and said, you know, I can get you a job and so on and she was hinting that my mother has anything she should give it to her and she could arrange for her to get a job as a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">At that time we didn't have anything, and my mother was upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">She said, if I had the diamond, I could have given her the diamond. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">I could have gotten a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">Lucky for us, we didn't have the diamonds and they sent us out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1004">QUESTION:  Why don't you tell me how that came about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1005">ANSWER:  About two weeks after we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , they lined up, had another selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">They took us to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , gave us some clothes, and they took aware our clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">I mean if I had a little -- I had a little skirt and a tank top, they took the skirt away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">The tank top was so short, I had a ribbon in the tank top and I had to tie it between my legs otherwise my whole behind was showing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And they ran us out, and again they had a selection and they were supposed to send us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Then something happened, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were not there, and they put us in some temporary <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">The following day, they ran another selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">They gave us a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> , and they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">This was the time I really don't know if <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> had two <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> or not because this is the only time and I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I remember, we went through the main camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , because we were in and this was, I saw the red <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , the permanent <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">I saw the band playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">So, I had a feeling they had some other <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> proper which they loaded us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">They unloaded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> somewhere else, and they put us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">They put us in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">They give us a piece a bread and a piece of cheese. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">There was one water bucket with water, and there was one slop bucket, and they put us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">I think we were there either two nights or three nights, and one night they stopped somewhere and they brought a fresh bucket of water, and assigned someone to distribute the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Brought a little cup and we were supposed to have a sip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">One woman got so frenzied, she grabbed her shoe and dipped it in there and drank from the shoe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">When they give us the clothes, by that time, I've got those laced up shoes with wooden soles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">One was white and one was black, and I had this men's shirt, long flannel thing, blue satin, significant later, I'll tell you about that story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">We stayed, and as I said the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was on and off and on and off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">At night it would stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">I remember once we were next <span class="NPIP">side</span> there were real cattle making cattle noises. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">This was an absolute nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Later on when I had my typhous fever, all I had I kept on saying, take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> out of my head, get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> out of my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">That's all I could hear is that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">It took me years before I wanted to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> anyplace, because even when I was in Europe and we traveled later, I was very reluctant to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">We finally arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> about maybe the third day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">All the passing and stopping we passed, I think, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">We saw someone tried to climb up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">We could see the bombed out <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and we were very happy to see those bombed out <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">I think it must have been the third day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">We felt that another night on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> we will completely lose our identity and it was confusing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">We were getting confused without food, without drink, and with the total darkness for so long, no knowing where we were going, what we're doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Anyway, they took us, we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> , and until that time <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> was not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">They had various camps of various entities, prisoner of war camp, but there was no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp concentration camp</span> as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">Again, they asked people who can't walk who would like to go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and I think one or two people who were very sick, they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Otherwise, my mother with the bad leg, she would not go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">She was afraid, because we knew by now, by that time, when you are sick something bad is going to happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">We finally got into the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">It was a long, long <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">The front of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , the beginning of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , there was <span class="BUILDING">administration places</span> , there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> , there was a little <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> which they could burn two bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">But this was done for bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">It was never done to use it for killing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">If people died, they would use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">They gave us a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> and we put our clothes in a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span> , and when we walked out from the other side of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> , we got the clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">They marched us down to the end of the <span class="DLF">street</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the very end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and there was this big <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> that could accommodate about 1,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">It was clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">We all got a blanket each. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">On the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> was wooden shavings, bales of wooden shavings, clean, never used. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">There as a <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> in the back right under the <span class="BUILDING">guards tower</span> , big <span class="DLF">pits</span> and there was a couple pieces of wood where you could kind of lean against, but you could use it any time you wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">There was a wooden trough with pipe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">We could use the water any time we wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">They nominated one lady, she was from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , she spoke German, as camp director, and her assistant, she was originally from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so they spoke fluently German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">They counted us once a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">This <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is located on the , So It's like heather. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">At that time there was <span class="DLF">fields</span> in back of us, later on they build more and more and more but at that time it was just us and the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">So, we could sit in the sun. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">We could drink when we wanted, we could go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> when we wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">Even at night, if you wanted to go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , -- if the guards heard something going on, he would put the light on, the spot light on, if he heard a movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">So, maybe they eliminated you when you were using the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">When the girls were sitting there, they would just look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">After a while, you lose all inhibitions, and if they want to look, let them look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">That's what we're going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">At that time we didn't have any doctors so the first day, the second day, they brought a big chest with some first aid things and some pills, some equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">Mom became the doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">There was a head dentist, I don't know his name, but he was until the very end, a very, very decent guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">So, one of the first questions he asked me is "How come your head is shaved?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">They couldn't understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">There were SS but they had no idea about the horrors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">They were just half way decent people in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">The food we got was paradise next to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">Fairly decent soup, we got some kind of coffee in the morning and a nice piece of bread and at night very often they had something, a piece of cheese or some artificial jam or something and Sundays we'd get red cabbage and there was some meat in it and potatoes with jackets and this was the first few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">The next few days they put another <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">We got a big group of Hungarian women another <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">So, about that time there was 3,000 people in that compound, because there were other groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1081">QUESTION:  All coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1082">ANSWER:  I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">I think they were coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> because the other ones were Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">Can I tell you something interesting about -- by that time, we didn't have a doctor and they brought a bunch of women from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> uprising, gentile women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">They were not with us, but they brought one of the doctors to us to work with us and one of the women somehow when there was another nurse and I and my mother and people were coming in with various ailments, there was one lady who was from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , had lost her husband and child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">She was not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">Her husband was Jewish, and she kind of started becoming administrator to the very end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">She was the administrator of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">As a matter of fact, we saw her in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">She survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">So, we would sleep -- it was so cold, but we would sleep, this Polish doctor, and Lisa and my mother and I would take one blanket and put it underneath us on the shavings and would cover ourselves with the three other blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">It was much warmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">And the body head kept us going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">It was getting cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">By that time, I think my mother started looking at some teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">I mean, checking, also everything on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , we had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to do but, one day we got notified and some people approached Mom and the other women and a few other ones that this is Yom Kippur and the Hungarians are going to have a service and we are invited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">After dark come in one by one and come in, sneak in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">So, one by one, it was very dark, and you know they closed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Except for the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> , there was no one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">They would close it up, all the Germans would just disappear at darkness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And we all hide under the blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">We wrapped ourselves in blankets and quietly walked into the <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">They lined up the shavings in such a way they were like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">In the very front they made a out of the shavings covered with blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">How they got a candle, I do not know, but they had a tiny little candle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">There as a young girl and an elderly woman and they sang the whole out of memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And they sung, and they warned us please do not cry, please do not wail, please do not make a sound. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">Don't sing, don't do anything, just be quiet, because the Germans would have shot all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">I tell you, this was one, even the Polish woman, she was sitting there with the tears running down her eyes, this Polish doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">We all sat, and until today I go to services and when I hear the chant, I see that scene because it was eerie. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Can you imagine, by that time there must have been 1,500 women there, like ghosts sitting in the gray blankets listening to the service, and then again, they let us out one by one, two by two, please don't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">Don't talk when you walk, just sneak into your own <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">This was unbelievable, the faith, and as I said we all took chances by attending that service.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1114">QUESTION:  Since you were not particularly religious growing up, how did the part of that service make you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1115">ANSWER:  Unbelievable because I knew -- let's put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">We had a record of one of the famous <span class="BUILDING">cantors home</span> so I have heard I don't think I ever went to services, because this was such an <span class="BUILDING">Orthodox synagogue</span> , so I couldn't go maybe when I was little kid they took me, Grandfather took me, but I never went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">But I always heard this record, because my father liked that cantor and he had this record. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">And I used to play with the record player, so I was very much aware of that chant, and I knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">I knew the melody, and I knew that this was something very, very important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1120">QUESTION:  Was there a special sense of solidarity?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1121">ANSWER:  Solidarity, feeling of something, hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">To do something like this in such circumstances was unbelievable, especially after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> where we were so controlled and here we could attend this service.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1123">QUESTION:  About the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , were you isolated from all these other groups?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1124">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">Well, the way the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was done was like I said, wa one long <span class="DLF">street</span> and there were various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">sub camps</span> on various <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">We were aware of several of them, and later on I was aware of more of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">One was called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">stern camp</span> and one was called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">diamond camp</span> , and those were the people from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">The rumor --they lived with the families at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">That's when the children came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">Rumor was that they paid a lot of money to the Germans to bribe them in terms of giving them diamonds and gold and money, so when they evacuated them, they promised that they'll be kept separate and they'll be kept with the families, and they'll not be destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">Eventually, they separated them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">They sent the parents out and the children were kept and I'll tell you about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">children camp</span> a little bit later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">They started bringing more and more people to our <span class="REGION">section</span> , our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">It's getting crowded. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">One day the <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> blew off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">There was a big storm and wind and just the <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">So, they put us somewhere temporary, and for a so called <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> they build a little <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> in a corner and the rest of the people were in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And that's the first time I saw myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">Those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> had <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">It was just a temporary measure until they could build some more <span class="NPIP">places</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">I walked one day, and I saw this person walking without hair and wearing this crazy blue striped dress, and I knew that this original model, there's only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">No one else has this copy of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">And I couldn't believe that this was me, and I stood there and I looked at my reflection an I touched my face and I touched my hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">I couldn't believe -- I mean I was like a little baby, like you show a baby a picture and he says that's me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">That's the way I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">I couldn't believe that's me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">I looked at the dress and said no there's no other one, that's me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I'm the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">It was a shocking experience to see yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1150">QUESTION:  How long had it been since you had seen yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1151">ANSWER:  This was after Yom Kippur, probably two months or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">It had to be in October because I don't know exactly when Yom Kippur took place, but this was shortly afterward when the <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> were blown down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">So, then one of the people who one of the tasks was one of my friend Alena who went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with me, her mother was a pediatrician before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">During the war, the beginning of a war, she was run over by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , so her face -- she was never a pretty women, but her face was damaged, crooked and stuff like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Well, she became a doctor, and they sent another one, Doctor Annie. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">She was a woman born in Russian, went to <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , married a French diplomat and she lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">She was Jewish, but she lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> before Hitler, because he was a French diplomat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">She was a socialite. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">She never practiced medicine, but this was our other doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">By that time they moved us again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">They build some <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and they built a so-called <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">We were moved like three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">So, this was when Schnabbles (ph) started coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">We had one big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where the patients stayed in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , and one corner we had the staff, and by that time they brought more nurses, must have been about SIX nurses, seven nurses and two doctors, my girlfriend Alena was a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">My mother was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">On the one <span class="DLF">window</span> we had this out patient clinic and in the back was a little tiny <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and it was a <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1167">QUESTION:  Excuse me, this is completely separate from the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1168">ANSWER:  They had access to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">It was part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but this was a separate little <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">That's when we started seeing the two I don't know what you call it, the German -- they were like medial corps men, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">One was a decent guy, his name was Fisher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">And he liked to grab the girls' boobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">So, we gave him a name of Fisher Tapper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">Tapper in Jewish is to tap, to grab it, and he liked to grab whenever he could when no one else was looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">The other one was obnoxious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">He was a young fellow and we called him the pig, so I don't know his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">And Doctor Schnabbles started coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">He was an elderly man, according to rumors again, he was a nose and ear man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">He was checking what patients and what cases we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">One of the first patients which he started doing something with, was a woman came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , had a compound fracture of her tibia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">The skin was broken, the bone was sticking out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">It was a horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">They put some kind of a metal frame around it and she had to be operated on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">So, he decided -- first of all, it was cool. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">He never would take off his coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">He did all his surgeries in his coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">He decided to set the leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">Well, he was not very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">So, the pediatrician opened up her mouth and said, "Doctor, don't you think you should do this and that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Well, that was the end of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">She was ugly as it is, he didn't like it with the scars and all on her face, but that put her in disfavor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">We had two guys were watching, he tried to set the leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">He never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">The woman was crippled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">She survived the war, I think, but she was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with us all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">Tape #3
ANSWER:  So, the first time he started setting that leg, it never took. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">Well, Schnabble was looking always for patients, what he could operate on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">He was always checking what we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">At that time, our staff consisted of Lisa, who the director of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">We had a scribe because they wanted reports. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">How many patients were admitted, what they were coming in for, what sicknesses we had and stuff like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">There must have been six or seven nurses, and then we had two orderly ladies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">We even had like a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">Those two women had to take the stuff out, but we had like a little <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> attached to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">I don't remember what we had later, but that one I knew we had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1206">QUESTION:  How many doctors were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1207">ANSWER:  At that time, they took the Polish woman away, there was my friend Alena, Doctor and Doctor Annie, the Russian woman, who didn't know much about medicine, but she was there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1208">QUESTION:  How many of the nurses really had any medical training?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1209">ANSWER:  Very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">What I had was like a practical nurse whatever I picked up, so did my girlfriend Alena. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">There were one or two, there was one Dutch, she came and there was another one, a <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> that really had training or not, but we did what we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Let's put it this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">It was more than the other people could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And then I had a little <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">We had also all kinds of patients and they were there forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">Some of them died, some of them we let out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">Basically, a lot of surgical things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">I remember there was one young girl who claimed she could never get up and we tried to get her up, and we could never get her up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">Sometimes we climbed up and to get her out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> to straighten out that mess, and never knew what was wrong with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">One day she just died, so evidently there was something wrong with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">There was another young girl she had a groin abscess which was draining for weeks and months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">I mean the woman with the leg, I remember once I wanted to wash my famous dress, I mean we had nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">So, if you wanted to wash a dress you borrowed something from a patient and wore that for a day and washed the dress and the patient was lying naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">Conditions were pretty horrid, but as I said, they were still feeding us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">We got the bread in the morning, and we, the personnel didn't have to stay and it was getting cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">We also had a young girl who was a mental patient, whether she was manic-depressant, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">One day, Schnabble came in and decided to do some kind of a surgery, and we didn't have electricity so they brought carbide lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">She got frantic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">Something was going on in the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and the lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">This was a scene like . </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">She went wild. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">We started chasing her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">She was running and she was jumping over the patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">She was climbing the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and they were the two, three story <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">And people, in that frenzy they are extremely strong, and they are extremely violent and they are very agile. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">Well, we finally got her and had some shots for her and put a straight jacket on her and got her some shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">She was petrified of Schnabble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">One of the <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> was still up and I spent with her about two or three days in the <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">My mother was petrified that she's going to kill me, but she kept calm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">I mean, you could talk to her a little bit, you couldn't get the story out of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">After that outburst, that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we give her the injection, that festered and eventually she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">She had an infection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">When we knew Schnabble was coming, we used to put the straight jacket on her, because she was so petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">When he walked in, we all had to stand at attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">We couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">The only person who ever moved was one of the little orderlies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">She was a little woman, blonde nose, no teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">She was a young woman, bow legged, and she wanted to show him that she was working, so she would sweep the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , including his feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">It was a riot, and he used to say, "The only one who works here is this one, the little one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">She's the only one who's working." </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">As I said, she would sweep over his books, and he liked her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">He never did anything in any way to stop her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">Well, one of the first opportunities he had to send Doctor out, they were sending out the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , at that time, were going in and out, whether this was to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> or something, so he sent her out, because he couldn't stand her, because she tried to correct him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1255">QUESTION:  Alena's mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1256">ANSWER:  Alena's mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">So, they went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">They did survive the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">I think they wound up in and went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">Her mother died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> or , and she survived and she was an artist, and she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">I was in touch with her, and then she died of cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">So, she was a young woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">But they survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">By that time, Mom had got some kind of ear infection, and I remember she was in such pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">She got some medication and she was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">So, someone had a pair of prison underpants, stripes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">I remember she put it on her head because this was the only warm thing she could put on her head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">She was sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , lying on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> with the underpants on her head like a hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">At that time, somehow, Lisa, this was the administrator, and the other one that was the scribe, somehow they were trying to do a little , and get my mother out, because they needed a dentist and they were bringing this man dentist, he was Dutch, from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">I think at that time, Binko (ph) came around, I don't know what happened, but there was a lot of whispering going on and a lot of talking back and forth, but whether the German dentist --whatever happened, Mom got better and went back to <span class="BUILDING">practice</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1271">QUESTION:  Tell me about Binko?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1272">ANSWER:  Well, she was a dentist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1273">QUESTION:  What was her full name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1274">ANSWER:  Haddasa Binko (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">She was a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">She came in couldn't find a job, was looking for a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">How she became the head doctor, don't ask me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">She must have talked to the right people, Germans probably, and they appointed her the head doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">That little <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> was getting too small for us so again they built another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">By that time we had a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">I think we were doing the outpatient in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">I finally beg <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hospital beds</span> a small little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which was my mother's office. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">In the back, at that time, they brought in a group of women from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">I don't know if they were Jewish or not, with children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">They had little children with them, and they built like an <span class="INT_SPACE">annex</span> to our <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , at the end of our <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> they were getting more firewood to warm up the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">They were getting some special soups, and they had some little possessions with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">They had pillows, they had some tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">Every once in a while we could get when the transport came in, they would bring us a box of junk, medical supplies and all kinds of odds and ends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">I was in charge of all the medical supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">Whenever I got any vitamins I would take it to the children, because I felt that this was very important for the mothers, so I became very friendly with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">Anything with baby powder, whatever they found and the Germans wouldn't use I started packages and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">A little cough medicine for children, pediatrics, so I would take it to those women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">Later on they helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">Anyway, it was getting cold, it was getting very, very nasty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">The weather was getting nasty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">One day a young woman came with pain -- and you see by that time we had a couple of other doctors, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">We tried to avoid telling Schnabble what was wrong with the patient. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">We didn't have the means to diagnose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">We had no blood tests. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">We had no x- rays, it was just feel and think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1301">QUESTION:  Were people coming in for all kinds of conditions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1302">ANSWER:  Everything, and I can tell you, describe the conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">There was one thing, dental condition, which I think it's called , where pieces of gums and lips would rot, decompose, and they would come in sometimes with a whole mouth missing, lips missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">I remember once three sisters came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">One was completely gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">The other one had quite an advanced case. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">The third one had just started, and every once in a while we got vitamins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">I mean we got all kinds of crazy things, which were odds and ends from various shipments, because the rest of the supplies -- oh yes, they used to give us once in a while paper bandages, and peroxide and some vitamins maybe and some aspirins. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">We did get some stuff, but it was little odds and ends like vitamin C. You had to use , the one who got the shot of vitamin C was the one who had the least advanced case of that cancer of the mouth, because we felt one or two shots may prevent that thing to spread further and maybe we could save. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">The oldest one, there was no way of saving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">She was, for all practical -- maybe here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with heavy doses of vitamins and heavy doses of medication, maybe one could save her, maybe, maybe not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">But certainly you couldn't save her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">This was what we had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">There was another thing which later came up, much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">A patient would come in with a little blister and the blister would get bigger and bigger and bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">Unless that blister was opened and drained very often half of the body was covered with the blister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">What did this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">I don't know, because I'll tell you later about the British doctors who were there and we used to tell them what to do with it, because they had no idea what to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1319">QUESTION:  How did you figure it out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1320">ANSWER:  We found that when they came with the blister and when we pierced the blister and drained it, and had some dressing we put it on, maybe some antiseptic powder, whatever we had we tried, somehow we could close the blister if 1t wasn't too advanced case of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1321">QUESTION:  Did you have enough supplies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1322">ANSWER:  No, I'll tell you about that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">Anyway, that one time this was one of the most horrid stories I ever saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">A young woman came in and the suspicion was that she had appendix inflamed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">It just happened that Schnabble walked in and he heard what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">What do you have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">See, we had to give them reports, and at one time this one medical guy used to stay the doctors have to stay at the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">When he comes in in the morning to pick up the reports, he doesn't want to get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">You had to hand him that while he was on the run. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">He was awful, screaming, yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">Anyway, Schnabble came in and found out that girl is complaining about appendix. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">He decided he is going to operate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">Felt her around, I think he put rubber gloves on or whether his leather gloves, again, he wearing his coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">We set up the surgery in the <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">He ordered his help, the Russian boys should bring some wood, so they brought some wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">It was raining. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">It was sleeting, so I started a fire in that little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wooden stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">He assigned my mother to the anesthesia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">She was his favorite anesthetist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">The anesthesia consisted of a little mask, a little cage that goes and you drip ether drop by drop from the bottle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">No other support, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">Annie was helping him, two guys were standing there, and I think he had one other girl, a nurse to assist, and I was the dirty nurse at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">He opened her up, couldn't find her appendix. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">He saw something and he said, well, I don't know that looks suspicious, he was ready to cut this out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">This was the bladder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">It looks like a fish bladder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">He poked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">He decided he can't find the appendix. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">He took all the intestines out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">And the conditions are not sterile exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">I mean the fire which was going there, it's full of soot and he can't find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">Put everything back together, took everything out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">He still can't find her appendix. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">At that time he barked to one of the guys, go bring Alenluf (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">Alenluf was a Greek doctor, I don't know if he was the main compound or where he was, but he was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> , and I understand he was a very known surgeon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">Well, a guy went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and Doctor Alenluf was running after him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">In the meantime, we kind of kept covered and kept the ether slow, not to have her in a deep sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">I grab Alenluf's coat and put a pair of rubber gloves on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">That's what I manage because by now he's very impatient. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">Alenluf looked in and found the appendix which was not infected at all, and closed her up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">She developed peritonitis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">For three days that woman was in a coma screaming and he was coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">He sent morphine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">He sent painkillers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">He also sent diet soup for her and white bread, but she couldn't eat anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">It lasted three days, and she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">But this was a horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">And you can't say anything, and he's pulling out all of her intestines out on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and back into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cavity</span> and back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and back in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cavity</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">It was a horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">And you have to stand there with a poker face and don't say a word, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">You can't react. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">And even this Doctor Alenluf, very gingerly worked and did whatever he had to do, and he didn't say you did wrong, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">He just did his job and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">This was one of the worst things which I witnessed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">Now the funny thing happened with those slovak women. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">We had a bunch of syringes and we had various -- like I said, you asked about supplies, we would write that we need so and so many bandages and so many aspirins, we need so much -- they would cut it down in half, but they would bring us stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">And we had some pain killers and we had something if someone had an attack of something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">We also had babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">There were babies born. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">We had one woman once who knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> in the middle of the night and said she's in labor, and our administrator went over, Doctor Annie went over to the <span class="BUILDING">tower</span> and said, look we have a woman in labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">None of us is a midwife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">So, they came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">The two guys, and they went from <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and they found a midwife and the baby was delivered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">I think Schnabble showed up so he called him Joseph Von Jordan, because there was a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> over there and he said this is <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River Jordan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">And the following day he sent a few diapers and something, there were a few of them, but the baby eventually died because the conditions were so bad that those infants could not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">But, they didn't take away the babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">They didn't kill the babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">They didn't do any harm to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1389">QUESTION:  There were a number of babies in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1390">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1391">QUESTION:  Were they <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">family camps</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1392">ANSWER:  That was later that we got into. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">At that time there were just a few newborn, we had a few of them and those slovak women who had their children with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">Anyway, one day I needed my syringes to be sterilized and walked through and the Slovaks had a fire going, and I said, "Would you let me do the syringes here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">She said, "Oh, you're so busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">Why don't you let me do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">I'll watch it for you, and I'll do it." </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">I said "Fine." </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">She burnt every one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">Now, this could be considered sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">I mean you know you had to really be so careful because here you are burning eight syringes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">I was beside myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">I was afraid that Schnabble would come in and want to do something, give them an injection, whatever if he said something we had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">Well, I didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">Finally I got this guy Fisher on the side and he was from <span class="REGION">Northern Poland</span> originally, and we were afraid to speak in front of him because we were afraid he understand Polish and I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">I told him what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">I said, look I was busy and I took it to them and they burned it and they didn't pay attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">He started bringing, the same day he came in the afternoon, he brought one syringe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">Whether he stole them, how he got them within a week I had the whole set of syringes back and he never denounced me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">He never said anything to Schnabble, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">So, even in those conditions there were people who were a little compassionate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">By that time things were getting bad, more transports. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">I believe this was the time they brought the commandant from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and he was cruel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1415">QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1416">ANSWER:  I think Horss. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">And that she's the head and she was blonde and some others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">I mean this nasty crew from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1419">QUESTION:  Do you know about what time, what year that was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1420">ANSWER:  This was in '44, had to be around winter of '44, because it was getting cold when we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , when we had those surgeries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">Also, when they were bringing the soups to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , there were a bunch of wild women running around and trying to take the soups, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kettles</span> , so we had to with sticks and stand guard, to escort the people who brought the soup, because they would just eat them and run with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">We needed them for the patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was getting bigger and bigger, and one day they said they were going to move all of our patients, and the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> first, on the other side of main <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">This was originally a prisoner of war camp, and they had some permanent <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> which were <span class="BUILDING">hospital buildings</span> , and they moved first the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> then they moved the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">Our group was assigned to main <span class="BUILDING">building</span> number one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">It had an <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">It had a <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">It had some wards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">We had like an <span class="INT_SPACE">outpatient room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">So, the first order of business was that the <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> had white tile floors and <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">So, the first thing they did, they removed all the tiles, the ceramic tiles, because the commandant wanted that for his <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">I believe we had electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">I can't even remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">They must have had electricity because my mother had this sterilizer that was an electric sterilizer or she had spirit or something to sterilize the instruments. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">The <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> was so beautifully equipped that when the Red Cross would come in an examine the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> that's where they would take them, because there was all the equipment you wanted to have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">No x-rays, but everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">There was enough novocain that we were afraid if we used up the novocain, the war would never end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">Then there must have been a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for the nurses, and then there was <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where the doctors lived and Mom took me with her and I shared a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with her because they wouldn't give me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">I was a nurse and they wouldn't give me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1440">QUESTION:  So, all along you were living in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1441">ANSWER:  Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">And that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was Doctor Annie and a couple of other doctors, Lisa was the administrator, Theresa who was the scribe, then they sent in another dentist, the Russian dentist, Larissa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">One day, the commandant children governor who was a Seventh Day Adventist, was German, they were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">She came down with typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">This was much later, so she was put in with the doctors in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">That was his orders that she should be kept in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">We had one <span class="INT_SPACE">surgical ward</span> where people had all kinds of wounds, surgical wounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">Sometimes we had to cut something, and we were getting very little supplies, and I took it upon myself -- because I was working always with Doctor Annie in the <span class="BUILDING">outpatient clinic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">I very seldom worked the <span class="DLF">wards</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">I did very well with the outpatients in whatever had to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">Whenever we got supplies I used to go in to change the dressings and you almost needed a gas mask for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">This was stinky, festering thing and we didn't have enough bandages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">We didn't get them enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">We couldn't change them every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">Maybe once a week, once in ten days they would bring us the supplies and there was some peroxide and maybe some ointment, maybe some powder to dust on the wounds, and I used to get so many blessings when I used to change the dressings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">This was the main <span class="BUILDING">hospital building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">The next one was the nicest <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">That's where the children were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">By that time, they took away or send them out or whatever happened to the parents of the Dutch and Belgium children, so they formed an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> there, and the Slovak women lived there with their children, and then the few mothers as long as the babies were alive, they lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">That's were Doctor lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">That <span class="NPIP">place</span> was heated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">They gave them some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">They were getting the white soup for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">They were getting the white bread, and I have a feeling they must have inoculated the children for typhus, because I was not aware of many of them having typhus fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">I know they were inoculating people because at one time Binko and I and another nurse went to one of the <span class="BUILDING">subcamps</span> or whatever and those people had passports from <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">Whether they were real passports, whether they were false passports, we don't know because many of them were Polish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">But we went out there when the epidemic started and we were inoculating the whole group there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">Then there were two other <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where one was not so bad and then there was one which was worse condition and then there was one number 5 where I think there were 500 people dead and 100 dead every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">They would bring the people -- they would just bring them in blankets and leave them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">I mean, people who were in the different <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> would just bring them in the blankets, and if there was any hope for them, they were separated and put somewhere else, but those were people like in a <span class="BUILDING">hospice</span> , they were just dying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">I was very friendly with the head nurse and she had she used to say to me after I had typhus fever come and I'll give you some bread because they didn't eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">She would get and she had a count of 500 so she got 500 pieces of bread according to the count. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">She said, they're not eating, and you may as well have another piece of bread and get some strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1474">QUESTION:  The dead people, they just dumped them <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1475">ANSWER:  That I'll tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">When we first came in there was a little morgue not far from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">A little concrete structure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">Well we started taking the people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">Everybody was taking them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">Well, after a while that <span class="NPIP">place</span> would not accommodate the bodies and they didn't have time to take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">It got to a point that it was like a tremendous <span class="DLF">field</span> of dead bodies, and that's what the British finally saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">Families would walk by and look and who do I know there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">If the blanket wasn't soiled, we would save the blankets for other people and if they were soiled we left them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">The pile was growing taller and bigger and bigger and taking more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and they had no -- they could not keep up with removing the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">Toward the end when there was this tremendous epidemic, they would give people extra soups, they were giving them all kinds of privileges. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">They would dig <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and burn the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">They just could not keep up with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">When the British liberated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> took the British General, whoever it was, showing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and naturally they avoided that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">So, there was a bunch of noisy girls and he said, never mind, come here, come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">We didn't speak English, but they said you have to see this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">And the British were flabbergasted seeing that, and they made the German officers remove those bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">They came so beautiful the first day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">They came with their hair done, and their uniforms were so nice and clean and they had to handle those bodies, and the deeper they were going, the more decomposed those bodies were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">Believe me, at the end of the day, they looked as raggedy as most of the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">This was horrid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">Anyway, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was getting bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">There were transports coming in every few days, and they needed help with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> came in, the able bodies would get a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and they would place them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , but there were some sick people coming in and they were checking who was sick and who is not, so they would need a doctor to ascertain whether the person could be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">A few were nurses, and I felt so badly, the girls were going out every night one I said, "I'm going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">I have to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">I just can't let them work both nights." </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">So, we went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">By the time we got there, most of the able bodies they were processed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">There was this big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with all kinds of bundles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">They made the people leave the bundles and there were sick people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">Some of them were lame, but we managed to undress them and put their clothes in those little fish net bags and once they went through the thing, the steam would kill the vermin, and they could go on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and find their own clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">There was one woman who was in a coma, and the Germans kept saying, "Throwing her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">She's half dead, she's dead." </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">I kept on shoving her around that <span class="NPIP">place</span> behind some things because I felt by the time I finished, maybe she'll revive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">Whether she was in a diabetic coma, what, a fairly young woman well dressed, and every time they saw me, they said "Come on take her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">Let's take her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">Let the guys take her out." </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">So, I was hiding her behind bundles, behind anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">Unfortunately the end of the evening we couldn't do anything but slap her face. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">I tried to give her some water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">Whatever we tried to do it couldn't revive her, so they took her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">That transport was so full of lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">We got so bitten by lice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1519">QUESTION:  Where were most of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1520">ANSWER:  They were from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">I think <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> by that time was clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">They finished with those.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1523">QUESTION:  They weren't necessarily coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1524">ANSWER:  No, no those people were coming with their own clothes and whatever the camp wore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">They were not from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">They were not from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">They were wherever they lived in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">Anyway, then it was getting almost light and they said all right we're finished with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">We can take you back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">And we said, "You know, you bathed everybody, you deloused them, and here we are crawling with insects. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">We are bitten all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and why don't you let us have a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and delouse us, our clothes, otherwise we'll bring the whole stuff back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">They said that's a good idea and they even stoked the fires and we had a nice warm shower.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1533">QUESTION:  How often did you shower?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1534">ANSWER:  We never showered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">The first time when they brought you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">This was the second one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">Maybe once they took us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">I don't remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1539">QUESTION:  So, you never washed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1540">ANSWER:  Well, we washed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">Maybe once they took us to <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , maybe when we're changing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , I think they marched us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">This was a pleasure, this <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , and they took our clothes and they deloused them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">Three weeks later I came with the typhus fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">I came back and I said boy I was bitten and this one doctor was with me and three weeks later, as I said, to the day, I came down with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">At first they didn't know what was wrong with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">So, by this time we didn't have Schnabble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">We had a young doctor who was wounded at the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">His arm was injured and he was working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">They heard that I might have typhus fever, so he and the dentist came to examine me, because they have never seen typhus before, and they figure out that I have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">By that time, the doctors in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that I slept with they decided they don't want anyone with the typhus fever, so they kicked me out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">But I had my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and I was lying next to a girl who used to be a patient of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">She had t.b. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">but I tried to keep her on calcitum. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">The theory was that calcium was good for t.b. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">and we had calcium, she would get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">Again, she was a young woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">You tried to help people who were not too far gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">We felt if we could help them, keep them going for a while, maybe they can keep on going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">By that time, the epidemic started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">The typhus epidemic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">It was by the end of the war, this must have been February or March and by the end 90 percent of the people had typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">My fever was building up about three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">It's like with pneumonia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">It build up, if the patient can survive the crisis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">Well, Mom would warm up water in the sterilizer and wash me and bring water and wet my lips. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">And those Slovak ladies made me a little pillow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">I'll never forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">This tiny little pillow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">They collected some feathers because they thought I was so nice to them, and they brought me this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">And I kept on saying "Get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> out of my head, get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> out of my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">I can't stand the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">And when they would bring the turnip soup into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , it was wretched. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">I couldn't stand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">Finally one night, I must have reached the crisis, and called this woman next door and said "Get me my mother." </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">So they woke up the night nurses, got my mother and she came running in and there was a doctor and again we had some supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">We had something to support the heart, just a stimulator heart, and they gave me a shot of it, because I felt I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">I think I was dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">Then I got better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">In the interim, I just want to bring out the difference between two doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">I haven't seen those surgeries because I was so sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">This young German doctor performed some surgeries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">Again, he wanted to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">He did them in the <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> under sterile conditions and he always had this Greek doctor with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">Sometimes he would I mean people told me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">Sometimes he would hesitate what to do and he would look at the Greek doctor and the Greek doctor would say, "Well, don't you think you should do this," but very diplomatically, and he never offered advice until the guy looked at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">He didn't know where he was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">So, they did perform some surgeries on those people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1588">QUESTION:  So there was actually a somewhat serious effort to cure people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1589">ANSWER:  I don't know if it was serious to cure people of if this was a way for him to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">I mean they never had the chance to -- if he is a very known professor and he is a young doctor and maybe he should learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">And he and his pal, the dentist, used to sit in the <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> most of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">He also had some massages done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">First one masseuse and then the other friend of mine, the one who was the head of that very sick ward. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">She would come in because he needed physical therapy on his arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">The first time we had the inkling that things were going bad for Germans they were discussing it very quietly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">The Russians are so and so many kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and they were afraid of Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">My mother overheard a conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">Whether that was done to let us know, or they just forgot about her working because she ignored them, that's when we knew things were happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1599">By the time, close to the liberation, there was cholera there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">There was a raging epidemic of typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1601">There was all kinds of sickness and less supplies and less food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">One day this other doctor, I think it was called up over lined us up -- we didn't have water, I don't think we had bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">He said times are very bad but you cannot abuse your patients, you have to take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">He was trying to give us a pep talk how to take care of our patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">How ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1606">One day one of the guards -- I somehow suspected whether they were experimenting with our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">One day a young woman came in and she had a turban, a very tightly wrapped turban around her head and she said she's itching. </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">We took off the turban, her head was so covered with lice, like you see, you have a big <span class="DLF">ant hill</span> and you kick it apart and you see the ants coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1609">I'm talking about big ant hills. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">I mean, you couldn't see the hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">So, we cut it and put some disinfectant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">We had some anti-lice things, burned the hair <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , the whole thing, and I was wondering if by any chance if they did not decide that this is a fast way of doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">Because they were all inoculated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">The Germans were all inoculated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">After the war, I think some of them got typhus, when they were handling the bodies, but they were very well isolated and inoculated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">Whether they tried this, I don't know because I don't know how anyone could have lived with that mess, and the way the turban was wrapped around her head, it was a young woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">It was -- I've never seen anything like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">I'm telling you you see a <span class="DLF">ant hill</span> , a big one, and this is what is creepy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">So, as I said, toward the end, there were so many sick people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">So many people dying, and you couldn't do a thing for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">Yes, there was an effort to save them, every once in a while they had the surgeons that wanted to do something, but I don't think this was so much an effort to save them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">I have a feeling that this was an opportunity for the doctors to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">Schnabble was just learning whatever he wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">I don't know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">He disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1626">QUESTION:  You mentioned a name "Kramer." </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">Isn't Kramer someone who also came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and replaced Horss?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1628">ANSWER:  I don't know whether he replaced Horsss. </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">I think Horss was caught in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1631">I really don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1632">QUESTION:  This Kramer then was head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1633">ANSWER:  I know there was someone by the name of Kramer gave us a pep talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">I never seen Horss. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">I know of him, but I have never seen him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1636">QUESTION:  Before we get to the end, I just want to ask you a couple questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">It sounds like you had contact with people, prisoners from a lot of different <span class="NPIP">surroundings</span> , is that true?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1638">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1639">QUESTION:  Not so much from the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but just with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1640">ANSWER:  The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> were coming in and this woman became the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">They would break out the <span class="DLF">fences</span> between some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and that became a huge, huge, huge <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1642">QUESTION:  So, then a lot of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">subcamps</span> got combined?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1643">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1644">The Dutch and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belgium camp</span> , that was combined with ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1645">The <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> , no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1646">What happened to the prisoner of wars or whatever, we took over those parts of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , I don't know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1647">I know the Russians were there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1648">QUESTION:  When you were more integrated were the conditions and relationship also integrated or did certain people just stay with their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1649">ANSWER:  I think they stayed more or less within their own <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1650">They had to stay and they were allowed to come to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but otherwise, I don't think there were any social activities there at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1651">QUESTION:  Did you develop strong relationships with the other people you were working with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1652">ANSWER:  Some of them, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">And there were a lot of strong relationship in terms of there was one of the nurses and she was very friendly with a couple of girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">She lived --she didn't live with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">She lived with a couple of girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">One of them was the head, a block elder, and she lived with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">They were like sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">That was the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">People were developing relationships and if they were like sisters, they could help each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">Some of the doctors, there were two, one of them died, so we were friendly later on, my mother and I, and we have seen her after the war and were together in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">We maintained contact with those people because we were together and there were a lot of relationships like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">People would adopt each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">Those were ones who had the easiest way of surviving, because when one was very sick, the other one helped them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">We had friends, two sisters, one is now in <span class="COUNTRY">Brazil</span> , one lives in <span class="REGION">California</span> , and they were together, and one of them I don't remember which one, she was so sick that the older sister would chew a piece of bread, because the bread was hard and she would chew a piece of bread and shove it in the sister's mouth to make her so she could swallow it, and that's how they made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">So, there were all kinds of pieces of kindness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">And when I was so sick that that girl who I used to take care of before, she was the one who basically, because the nurses wouldn't do much for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">They were busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">But she was conscious, she was not very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">That's why they placed me there and she kept an eye on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">If I needed anything, the sicker I was getting, she would take a sip of water and put it in my lips or wet something and put it on my lips and she was in a way taking care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">She didn't do physically anything, she was in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , but she was kind of keeping an eye -- she was the one who alerted them that I was coming down with the crisis, so she did help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">Mom got typhus later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">I mean all the doctors got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">I mean everybody was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">The sign was if you spilled your water like we had this French doctor, she had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> above us, and the sign was that if you started taking water at night to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and then spill it over head she had typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">We knew that she had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">There were certain symptoms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">I could recognize someone with the typhus just looking at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">Later on, the British doctors, they had no idea what's wrong with a patient. </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">I said the trembling, the lip trembling, people didn't even have the spots, there were certain symptoms you could just recognize they had typhus.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1681">QUESTION:  Certainly you've read stories and heard stories in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> about people that the need for survival --
ANSWER:  There was stories about it that there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">I never witnessed it but there were stories about cannibals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1683">QUESTION:  People would steal from each other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1684">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">It was known. </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">If someone was unconscious they put a piece of bread in front of them so they would steal it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">This was, as I said, the will to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">But it got so bad that they were walking to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , they were walking to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and they were just defecating.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1689">QUESTION:  This was another interesting thing I read in your testimony. </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">When I read about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> I guess towards the end it sounded as if, not from your testimony, but from elsewhere, that nobody really took care of anybody?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1691">ANSWER:  Basically, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1692">QUESTION:  The authorities of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> really didn't make any provisions to feed, to clothe, to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1693">ANSWER:  Well, they were housed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">There were <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1695">Clothes, whatever they came with, and there were some people working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1696">As I said, when the people came in with their own clothes, the good stuff was taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">They had big <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> when the war ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">The prisoners broke into those <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> and everybody was carrying all kinds of clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">One of the funniest thing this Russian dentist with his boyfriend and my mother didn't know what happened, she was just recuperating from typhus and this guy walked in in a top hat, tuxedo with tails and a white scarf around his neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1700">He was one of the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1701">They were the first ones to break into the <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> and he thought he looked very snazzy in that outfit, this was after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1702">But the war was a <span class="DLF">field</span> of dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1703">There were people dying by the thousands every day and they would just dump them out and there was no way no matter what the Germans tried to do to bury them, and they would bring crews to the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">They fed them extra, they forced them to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1705">There was tasks that they could not keep up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1706">I think there were two <span class="DLF">graves</span> when they finally cleaned out the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> one I don't know how many thousands of people buried in those <span class="DLF">graves</span> , <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1707">QUESTION:  What percentage of people do you think came through the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> at one time or another? </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">You were treating women, correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1709">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">We had <span class="DLF">lines</span> every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">As a matter of fact, after we were liberated they took everybody to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> , but in the meantime the British helped us clean up some of -- they whitewashed some of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , and I stayed another month or so, maybe another few weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1714">No, we liberated the 15th of April, the 8th of May I was still in the old <span class="NPIP">place</span> and they gave us new blankets and we were still admitting people and still taking care of it because the healthy ones they could process and take to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> , which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">military camp</span> , and they placed them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">The sick ones, they had a whole procedure they had to -- and they were magnificent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1716">They would take them in and they would bathe them on stretches and they would shower them and they cleaned their heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">And they were basically British soldiers and dress the wounds and place them in <span class="BUILDING">hospital barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">This was a very slow process. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">In the meantime, people were coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">They needed help now, and by that time we had some supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1721">So, we were admitting some of them and we were treating some of them on an outpatient basis, but at least we had some bandages and supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">We had some medications. </span><span class="sentence" id="1723">If they had a headache, we could give them aspirin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">I mean things like this, and they were still getting sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">They were still getting typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">That thing was still raging, and the British soldiers were all inoculated and toward the end there was a rumor they were going to evacuate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> like they did in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">There was a march. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">There was a group that went on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and I think the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were bombed, and I think some of the Dutch Jews perished that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">Anyway, there was a rumor that the camp is mine and they are going to evacuate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> whoever can walk and the rest of the people will go, and the girls came over to me, the nurses that wanted to distribute some of the medicine what you have and the syringes and everything and they said, "Are you going to walk?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">I said, "No, I'm not leaving Mom, and she can't walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">I'm staying no matter what happened." </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">Well, that night we had bombs and they bombed this was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lindenberg</span> , the Allies bombed a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and a day or two later we saw all the Germans walking -- the British didn't come in yet, but they were walking with the white arm bands and for some reason I was sent out to either get the soup or get some supplies and I was passing the <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> and our favorite the guy, the pig, this German, he was burning paper in this <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> , in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">They were very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">They were still in charge, and they came in and they wore the arm bands, didn't discuss anything, but at the same time the day the British came in there was a cook, a German cook in one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> , and they were supposed to be working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">He said, I have another few bullets and I'm going to shoot all the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">He killed a girl, wounded one, and the British were not in, the Germans were half way in and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">By that time we were guarded by Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1738">The guards were all released, outside guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1739">And there was a group of Hungarians and they were guarding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with the guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1740">This was a German, and they felt, they swore that they are going to get themselves some Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1741">One of the girls was brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1742">She walked out, she said, "We are free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1743">We are liberated." </span><span class="sentence" id="1744">Bang, and she was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1745">What has happened, when the British came in the 15th of April the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> went through, waved the flag, everybody say hooray and they went out and we are still prisoners until they finally came in and started checking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1746">Well, it was in the afternoon, they just went in until they could organize themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1747">Then they discovered the bodies so they called all the officers and the soldiers and they had to remove the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1748">Some of the girls were nuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1749">They were distributing the food in metal cans and they were rusting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1750">One of the girls saved the rations which was pretty awful and rotten and become spoiled and she wanted one of the Germans to eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1751">And the Germans were guarded by the British because otherwise the mob would have torn them apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1752">There was a language problem, but this one somehow managed to convey to the British soldier that she doesn't want to do any harm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1753">She just wants that German to eat that food, and he made him eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1754">The funny thing is, I went once to see this removal of the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1755">It was a frantic scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="1756">The girls were screaming and yelling and hollering and they wanted to pull on the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1757">I went once to see it, but I just couldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1758">I also went out, I think one day after they liberated us and I went out -- the <span class="DLF">gates</span> between the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compounds</span> were open. </span><span class="sentence" id="1759">The main <span class="DLF">street</span> was open. </span><span class="sentence" id="1760">That's where you saw this unbelievable mob of people walking with all kinds of clothing because they broke into the <span class="BUILDING">depots</span> and whatever they could wear, the funniest outfits and funny things, and people were milling, looking for friends and that's how I went to the <span class="BUILDING">men's place</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">men's camp</span> to look for people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and people who I knew, and I found this one boy who had a very bad eye infection and got him doctors and got him to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1761">He lost his eye but he survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1762">He's alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1763">He lives in <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1764">Tape #4
QUESTION:  We started talking about liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1765">I wondering if the Germans were sensing what was happening and if there treatment of you changed, if you could feel their fear?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1766">ANSWER:  Well, once the bombing took place nearby, a couple of days before the British came in, and that's where the <span class="BUILDING">German headquarters</span> surrendered and therefore the Germans were wearing the white armbands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1767">They were ready for take over and by that time, except the crazy shooters, the ones we were in contact with, they were okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1768">Even the one that was screaming, he was always quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1769">I saw him burn the papers and I don't remember why I went out, either to pick up some supplies because we still could not walk between the compounds on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> , but for some reason I was sent for something, I think we were sent to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> for soups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1770">By that time they were not delivering and that's why I went with a group of girls, and that's when I saw him burning those papers frantically. </span><span class="sentence" id="1771">They were packing and he didn't even see us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1772">QUESTION:  They weren't trying to convince you how nice they were or anything like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1773">ANSWER:  No, I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1774">I understand that the dentist somehow got some testimony of various prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1775">They never approached us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1776">This was one person I would have given him a clean bill of health. </span><span class="sentence" id="1777">He was arrested, but then he was released because he really didn't do anything ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1778">QUESTION:  Do you remember how you felt when the British arrived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1779">ANSWER:  Unbelievable feeling of relief. </span><span class="sentence" id="1780">Just went out to see them and we all went out to see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1781">First the people came in and said the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British tank</span> went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1782">I think I've seen the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British tank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1783">They were shooting, so we were afraid to walk around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1784">The Germans were still shooting and the Hungarians were still watching. </span><span class="sentence" id="1785">You couldn't go outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and after they finally took all the guns from those Germans, then you went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1786">That's when I went to the main, on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> and I saw this unbelievable motley crew of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1787">Some of them were still dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1788">Some of them were hardly moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1789">There were bodies around, but whoever could move, they were moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1790">They were walking, and they were smiling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1791">And unfortunately, there were so many people who died still after the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1792">It was incredible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1793">QUESTION:  How did the British treat you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1794">ANSWER:  The liberators treated us very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1795">The first day they decided we are starving so they brought soup, and the soup was very rich, and we all ate the soup and all got deathly ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="1796">Our bodies could not absorb this fat, so everybody got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1797">We overate that soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="1798">It was a thick, I remember, with a coat of fat on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="1799">They were very anxious to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1800">The British would as I aid the British soldiers as such they were beautiful towards the patients. </span><span class="sentence" id="1801">The British officers they were just -- later on they were funny, we had to fight them, but in the beginning they were just very compassionate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1802">Then they realized that the food they were giving us we can not take this very rich food, so they started giving us like a diet food for a while until we could adjust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1803">They were giving us those little K rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1804">They were giving us cigarettes and chewing gum and some lemonade and some cookies and were giving some tins of those cookies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1805">I decided to smoke a cigarette. </span><span class="sentence" id="1806">Mom said, I don't want you to smoke until after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1807">The war was still on, so the 8th of May and I was sitting and the cannons and you could hear the war was over and there were announcements and stuff like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1808">I took a package of those -- I had a whole bunch of those little player cigarettes and I was smoking one after another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1809">She said, I told you not to smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1810">She was so sick, she said I told you not to smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1811">I said, "Mom, the war is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1812">I'm smoking." </span><span class="sentence" id="1813">This was like an act of rebellion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1814">QUESTION:  How come you remained in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for a while after the British liberated you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1815">ANSWER:  They needed some people to be still there because as I said, the transfer of the patients was such a slow one they needed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1816">It took them a while, maybe a week, ten days, two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1817">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1818">And she was so sick, so I stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1819">I couldn't move her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1820">By the time we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> , they didn't have any more <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , so there was this huge <span class="BUILDING">officers' casino</span> and they converted this to a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1821">This was the end of everybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1822">And they had this huge <span class="INT_SPACE">ballroom</span> , it held about 170 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1823">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> was gorgeous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1824">It was a round <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1825">They called it the round <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1826">Out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">ballroom</span> , there was a magnificent <span class="DLF">terrace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1827">And Rhododendron blooming around, it was just gorgeous. </span><span class="sentence" id="1828">There were a couple <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> where they had the <span class="BUILDING">casino</span> , but they removed all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and they patients there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1829">I think the paper I gave you was signed by this doctor who became the head of this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1830">At that time our staff consisted of British doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1831">They were volunteers, second or third year medical students.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1832">QUESTION:  Your <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was transferred to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1833">ANSWER:  Well, there were a lot of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but this was the very, very end of it, because they were transferring people all the time, but this was the very end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1834">There must have been about 250, 300 patients at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1835">QUESTION:  Did they burn down or do anything with the old <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1836">ANSWER:  I'll tell you that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1837">So, we had <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1838">Mom started working a little bit there was a <span class="BUILDING">dental office</span> there, but she had swollen legs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1839">She was just working a few hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1840">They had the most beautifully equipped <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> I have ever seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1841">I don't know if many fancy <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> here have <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> , fully electric, they could cook a few hundred eggs at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1842">They had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">frying pans</span> they could turn upside down by touching a button. </span><span class="sentence" id="1843">It was just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1844">There were naturally, a couple of elderly Germans running that <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1845">They claimed that they never knew anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1846">As I started telling you there was the British doctor who was the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1847">A few British nurses, we had British volunteer students at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1848">A bunch of us, a few French nuns came from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and they brought in a bunch of German nurses, and there was one <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> with people with t.b., </span><span class="sentence" id="1849">diarrhea, as sick as they come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1850">The British assigned our girls to that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that had 170 <span

id="1852">The rationale was that since some of the very sick people cannot don't know what's going on and the Germans may harm them and we will be much more compassionate to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1853">Our argument was that we all went through typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1854">We are all very weak, and there's no reason for us to be exposed at this point to t.b. </span><span class="sentence" id="1855">and diarrhea and we should be assigned the convalescent, which was a much lighter load and let the Germans work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1856">So, we went on strike. </span><span class="sentence" id="1857">We had a translator girl who spoke English and finally got through his head that this was the right thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1858">But he was very much afraid what will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1859">We said we will supervise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1860">We'll check, and the nurses were busting because they were all registered nurses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1861">We were all a motley crew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1862">We didn't have uniforms, I mean, like a butcher's apron. </span><span class="sentence" id="1863">We had nothing, and we were watching what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1864">Another thing I was very happy to do, they would send the women from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen</span> to clean the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and we had this was the <span class="INT_SPACE">ballroom</span> , it had a gorgeous <span class="INT_SPACE">parquet floor</span> and we made them wash the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> twice a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1865">They would come in the morning to clean, and they would come in the afternoon to clean, and God forbid that they left a <span class="NPIP">dry spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1866">Wash it, the German word was . </span><span class="sentence" id="1867">I couldn't speak German very well, but this was a funny feeling, you know, I was in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1868">So, little by little our big <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> would empty because they were getting better and getting out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1869">The British, I started telling you about the British soldiers even before when they had this blister disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="1870">Once, I remember one of the young fellows came and he was getting ready, he found a patient with a blister thing and he was getting ready for a serious surgery. </span><span class="sentence" id="1871">I took him on the side, I said you are the doctor, I'm not, but we have had such experience with it, you don't have to do serious surgery, just make sure you lance it and drain it and then if you have -- they didn't have antibiotics but I think sulfur or whatever they had, something to dress the wound and she'll be okay, because she didn't have tremendous blisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1872">He did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1873">They were still students. </span><span class="sentence" id="1874">A lot of them got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1875">They left and we had a group of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> medical students, volunteers and they were not treated by the British very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1876">They used to mooch the cigarettes from us because we used to have all the cigarettes from the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="1877">We were getting those packets every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1878">Somehow they resented that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1879">Those guys, I think they were older, and they were just very good, trying to help the people and take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1880">The British burned <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> as they emptied it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1881">They left one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> standing and I don't know when there was a ceremony and we were invited, taken in by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1882">I think there is a picture at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> of that ceremony. </span><span class="sentence" id="1883">This was when they raised the words of General Glen Hughes who was the Second British Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1884">He said that now they can raise the British flag because this awful <span class="NPIP">place</span> doesn't exit any more and the ceremony was that they threw flame throwers burned the last <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1885">Whether the <span class="BUILDING">administration building</span> still stands, I don't know, but this was the last thing and they raised the British flag over it because they never raise a British flag over a <span class="NPIP">place</span> as horrid as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> .</span></p>
