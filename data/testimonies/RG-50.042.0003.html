<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Why don't we start talking about the 1930s, and why don't you tell me how old you were and what you remember of daily life as 1t was impacted by the Nazi party, how it came into greater and greater power--pogroms, laws...
ANSWER:  Now, well actually I think I should start in the, let me see, I was born in 1910, so that would have been around 1930 when the Nazi party really came into being. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">And I remember that they were then a party #26, we had many, many political parties in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at that time, and they were party #26. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">They had advantage over other political parties such as the communists and democrats because they had a lot of money backing behind them and when they marched into a certain <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , they had beautiful shiny boots and beautiful uniforms and they marched in military uh formation, whereas, democrats and the communists at that time, they were organized, but they were like a bunch of people running down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , as compared to well-organized march of the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">We lived at that time in an <span class="REGION">area</span> called ----------------- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working class neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I would say, very largely communist, not necessarily party members, but certainly sympathizers. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">There was one particular day I remember quite vividly, when the Nazis decided they wanted to march down the main <span class="DLF">street</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , by the thousands incidentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">And, we...didn't exactly like the idea, this was our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , our turf. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">There was a lot of shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Machine guns had been mounted on <span class="DLF">roofs</span> , would shoot into the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Group, and so forth, and that became a very bloody affair. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">This was only one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I guess it, I'm not quite sure about the date, but it was in 1930, a very early 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I was involved in many of the anti-Nazi street fights, and ----------, | was never a member of a party really, but certainly a sympathizer. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">But then I was only 20 years old or 21 years old, so I had a lot of things that I wouldn't do today. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And, it is generally assumed that the Holocaust, and it rightly so, actually started until 1942, when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> came into being, but that's not really quite true, not in my opinion because the first boycott of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> happened in April 30, 1932! </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Where they took all, this 1s a long time before the holocaust started, as per se holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">They uh, boycotted the <span class="DLF">doors</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> , put the name ‘juden' on the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and so forth, and they marched in front of those <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> for prevent customers from going in, but there were many people, I remember very vividly, one particular <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> that we lived in was a <span class="BUILDING">cigar store</span> , it sold cigars and cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I know, my neighbors went in there, they never smoked a cigarette in their life, they just went in there to spite the Nazi movement at that time, they were not very much in favor of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">But we have to put this in a proper context, things were very bad in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Unemployment was perhaps, I'm not sure of this now, but I would say perhaps 20% people weren't working, there, there was no jobs to be had, and as time went on, they became more and more sympathetic to the Nazi movement, first, I would imagine, for economic reasons and secondly, it became very popular to be antisemitic because it was easiest thing in the world, if you want to hate somebody, the Jews are always around! </span><span class="sentence" id="20">They can be hated. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So, in my opinion, the actual holocaust, with the exception of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camp</span> , started in 1932, and, as I said before, April the 30th. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">A group of young men, friends of mine, we used to hang around together, we were quite active in dancing and all this kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We decided we're going to join the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">It was not an army, it was called uh...Arbeitz, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arbeitz</span> , Arbeiten, I don't recall exactly the name of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , in which we had regular military training except for weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">That was against the Versailles Treaty at that time, which had been still obeyed then. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We had no weapons, but we marched in military formation and, and we used uh, uh spades, shovels, as rifles, which marching and all this kind of thing, we had a regular military training. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">At that time that I went in there, it was, nobody asked me if I was Jewish, and I didn't mention it, so we all got accepted into this uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Somehow or other, I don't recall how, they found out that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I was sta-uh stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marineburg</span> , <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> , which was right near the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elding</span> , also in <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elbing</span> then was German, but it had been independent uh earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">It's been kicked back and forth between <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">We marched from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marineburg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elding</span> , which was, I'd say, about 30 kilometers, and we stood guard for Hitler, and I claimed to have very distinct, uh, I don't know what I should call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I probably was the only Jew in the world that ever stood guard for Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I saw him as close as I see you right in front of me now. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">He was making a speech at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elding</span> , and as he walked by us, reviewing the troops, he was a little man, everyone knows the mustache and his hairdo, and he looked perfectly calm and we stood out there waiting for him to finish, which took about 3 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">When he came out, and he marched by us again toward his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , the man looked, and I remember this very vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">He looked as, like a maniac, he talked himself into a total frenzy. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I don't believe that he even knew what he was speaking about anymore, because he was, he looked a, a person that has not control over his emotions anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">It was found out somehow or other, as I said before, that I was Jewish, and I was discharged from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I must have been in there, I don't remember exactly, I'd say close to a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">This was in 1932. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Nothing much happened between 1932 and 1935 except the regular political uh marches through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> that they weren't wanted and so forth, and in the meantime, the Nazi party grew, and grew in popularity. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">A lot of the German fellows, young fellows, they weren't really antisemitic or anti anything, but they had nothing to do, they had no jobs, and here, they come around they give them a beautiful pair of boots, and they give them a nice shirt and a pair of britches, and have a gun in your hip, you know, you can go out and shoot somebody, it's okay, you'll get away with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Now, that became very popular, but in 1935, actually it was September 15, a new law came into being, and that a German family could not have a gentile maid, there were many Jewish families were quite wealthy too, and they had a maid, a live-in maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">They could not have a live-in maid under the age of 55, for apparently, obvious reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They also at the same time a law took effect that did not allow a Jewish person, male or female, to go with a Gentile person, male or female. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">At that time, I was going with a nice young lady that I had gone with for some time, and we were out camping, I remember very well, I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kayak</span> , and we went out camping near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , and there was a fellow and, next to us, near us, in another little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> , we slept in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">He wanted to make a date with this young lady that I was going with, and she didn't want any part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">He reported me to, to the Gestapo, and I was arrested for going with a gentile girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I got six months in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , solitary confinement in 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">When I was released, I became known as a habitual criminal in the eyes of the Nazi party. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I was a habitual criminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I never did anything criminal in my life, but as far as they're concerned, being, doing something against the law was enough to make me a habitual criminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">As a result of that image that was put on us, I was arrested again 3 years later, on June 14, 1938 at 4 o’clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We had gone to a birthday party of my sister in law. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I was already married. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I had a baby, my wife was pregnant again. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Four o’clock in the morning there's a banging on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">We woke up, we said, "What are they? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Crazy? </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They want to continue the party 4 o’clock in the morning?" </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And I yelled, "Go on <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="63">That's enough!" </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And the banging persisted and I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and there came 2 plain clothes men with guns, "You're under arrest." "</span><span class="sentence" id="65">Under arrest? </span><span class="sentence" id="66">What for? </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I didn't do anything." </span><span class="sentence" id="68">No questions asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I said, "Would you mind getting out so my wife can get up?" </span><span class="sentence" id="70">He says, "Oh, that won't bother us." </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I said, "It may bother her." </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So, they stepped outside the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and I got up, I got dressed, they took me to a <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> near the <span class="REGION">area</span> where we lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  We have to reload. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We just ran out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  The emotional impact of this... beep.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  Okay, why don't we back up to the point where at 4 in the morning, they came knocking on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , so go right back to that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , two plain clothes...
QUESTION:  Do the whole knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and back up a little tiny bit more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We had gone to a birthday party on June the 14th, so some friends of ours who had come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , must have been about midnight, somewhere around midnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Four o clock in the morning, we had a banging on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and I thought those were our friends coming back to continue the celebration. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I said, "Come on, go on <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , it's enough already. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">You know, 4 0 clock, got to work tomorrow." </span><span class="sentence" id="84">The knocking persisted, I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and two plain clothes men with guns came in to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , "You're under arrest." "</span><span class="sentence" id="85">Under arrest? </span><span class="sentence" id="86">What for? </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I didn't do anything." </span><span class="sentence" id="88">No questions asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">They didn't push us around at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I was, I got dressed, they took us to a <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I got into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> perhaps as large as this one right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">There must have been 2 or 300 people in there, and we didn't know what was going on. "</span><span class="sentence" id="93">What are you, what are you here for?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="94">I don't know, I didn't do anything." </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We had absolutely no idea what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">All we knew, we were under arrest. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Around 7 0 clock or 6 0 clock in the morning, they loaded us all on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and they took it to a remote <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Foulsborough</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">It's a name, it's in a, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were supported by a police--well, those are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">storm trooper cars</span> , not really <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">police cars</span> , the private police had nothing to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and one on each side with bloodhounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">To be facetious, they wanted to be sure nobody gets lost, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They took us to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , and we were loaded, we were loaded into regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> , as what happened later. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We were not in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> , we went in a regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and then, several hours of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride, we didn't where we, we had no idea what was happening, and you can imagine some older people, I was just a young fellow, but there were some older people--started crying, we didn't know, what did we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">When we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , they loaded us back on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> again, no that is not correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oranienburg</span> , which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">How far outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped, they shoved us all out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and we began to march towards the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We still didn't know what was going to be, we had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Along the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ride, some, we had to run, there was no walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">One particular incident I recall (pause) like it was yesterday, an old gentleman with the name of Solomon, I'll never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">He must have been well in his 70s, he simply couldn't run. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">He couldn't run, he had to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">He couldn't run and he collapsed, and he laid in the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and one of the storm troopers, a tall young fellow, very slender, very tall, stepped on this throat (blows his nose), this is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Unbelievable but true, till the man was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We had to pick up his body, and throw him to the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and we continued on into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> where we were assembled in a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , and a strange incident happened at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We faced a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , a <span class="DLF">door</span> on the right, a <span class="DLF">door</span> on the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">People went in the left <span class="DLF">door</span> , came out the right <span class="DLF">door</span> , entirely different people. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Their hair was shaven off, they had a prisoner's uniform on, the very wide striped uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">My number was 6199. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">A strange thing happened as I mentioned before. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">My parents were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I hadn't seen my father, and he was my step father I must say, in perhaps 8 years, maybe 9 years, right after I was bar mitvahed, my parents separated for a specific reason, and I hadn't seen him in all these years, and I saw him, met him in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">It was uh, hard to describe the emotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">My father was a very, very big man, he weighed 350 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And I introduced myself, he didn't recognize me of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And we became a family again. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">While we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , I tried to take care of him as much as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">There wasn't too much that I can, could do at the time, but, I just have to mention it because this all relates to a very traumatic experiences in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We worked ten hours a day if I remember correctly. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We slept on straw, on strawbacks, it was a uh jude sack filled with straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I guess that's common uh you know, under certain circumstances, many people sleep that way, and we worked 10 hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">On a <span class="DLF">field</span> that was approximately a square kilometer, somewhere around that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">One area of this <span class="DLF">field</span> was quite high, the other <span class="REGION">area</span> was quite low. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The <span class="REGION">area</span> had to be leveled, and what was done was they had <span class="DLF">tracks</span> running from one end to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">On those <span class="DLF">tracks</span> were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mining cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Now in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mining car</span> is square. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Over there a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mining car</span> is a triangular shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="140"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Steel mining cars</span> , and each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had about ten of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mining cars</span> on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">On each one of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mining cars</span> storm trooper was standing with a re--and we had to run from one end of this <span class="DLF">field</span> to the other, shovel the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mining cart</span> full of dirt, and return to empty it out on the lower end. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">If anyone would have told me at that time that I can run 40 kilometers a day, I'd say you're crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Day after day after day. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The food was barely edible, I remember one particular incident, it so happens I hate broccoli, and they had broccoli soup for 3 days in a row, and for 3 days in a row I didn't eat anything, just dry bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The other prisoners gave me some of their bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">They ate the soup, I got the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I just couldn't eat it because if I had I would have gotten sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Psychological? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Certainly, but I'm entitled. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">At one time, they assembled us in a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">They had <span class="BUILDING">machine gun towers</span> all the way around, and they were shooting machine gun bullets over our head, maybe a foot above our head, and they said, they made a, the commander made a speech, they said that if <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , this was the time of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> taking over the-------------- in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They said if <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> gets involved in the war because of -------------, these machine guns will be lowered and we're going to kill you all. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We, we were hoping that this wasn't going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Perhaps, many people will recall a Christian pastor with the name of Niemoller. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">He was arrested from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pulpit</span> in a little <span class="BUILDING">church</span> somewhere in <span class="REGION">Midwestern Germany</span> because he simply didn't believe in the Nazi doctrine, and he was preaching openly against it, and he was arrested and put in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> it became like an international incident at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I met him in -------- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">What they did to this man, one human being doing this to another, is beyond description. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">This man in the perhaps 6 months that he was in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> aged 25 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Perhaps I shouldn't say this, but they literally made him eat his own waste, but he lived through it because he had very strong faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I just mention

<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  At one time we were assembled on the <span class="INT_SPACE">atrium</span> , the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> as you will, and as I, I always like to

"</span><span class="sentence" id="356">Why not? </span><span class="sentence" id="357">All the other guys do." </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So, we all signed up at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">There was no question asked if I was Jewish or not Jewish, and we all signed up, and I was stationed in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marienburg</span> , it was in <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">This was about 30 kilometers away from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elbing</span> , which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> , it's the biggest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> , that's exactly what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">No, I'm sorry, that's cor-incorrect . </span><span class="sentence" id="362"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elbing</span> is near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gdansk</span> in the same general area. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">This has got to be voided. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">This is not... Just start it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And leave out those, just leave, just use any name---------------------, but start again on you start again on your 22nd birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Yeah, we decided, a bunch of them, we were friends, we decided to join the army, but, I must say that the army was not weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">We had military training in every <span class="NPIP">aspect</span> , except we had no weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">We used shovels or spades as shoulder weapons, shoulder arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Other than that, we had regular military training. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Nobody wanted to know that I was Jewish, and uh, I don't know the exact date, we went to, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marienburg</span> , where I was stationed, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elbing</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> about 30 kilometers away, where Hitler was to make a speech, and when he spoke, he spoke for 3 hours, like Castro, he can go on forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I happened to be in the front row of the formation, and as Hitler looked like a, a little person, he's a normal man, short, with a mustache and a hairdo, and perfectly normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">He walked into this <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elbing</span> , where he spoke for 3 hours, and when he came back, the man was totally frenzied. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">He, I, he didn't even, he didn't look any more normal than anything can, you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">He talked himself into a total frenzy. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Whenever he made a speech, he was a great orator, he hypnotized the masses. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">They would have killed their own mother if he said "Go kill 'em." </span><span class="sentence" id="378">He had that ability to hypnotize the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And I claim a very dubious distinction to be probably the only Jewish fellow that ever stood guard for Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">This is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Do you remember, did you hear the speech? </span><span class="sentence" id="382">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">It was on speakers, I believe, I, I really am not sure, I don't think we heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">No, I don't believe so. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I don't even know if they had a P.A. system in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Do you have any other direct knowledge of Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Did you ever see him any other time? </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Only on, in normal appearances when he came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you know, when he was riding in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , like you might see President Bush riding down uh, <span class="DLF">Commercial Blvd.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="389">or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">You know, other than that I had no contact with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">We seen them all, like Goebbels and Herring and Hitler and Goering and all of those people, and Rosenberg, and Hess, but only in passing, when they came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">You talked about antisemitism and you talked about being more German or being more Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Talk to me about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">No, I didn't quite mean it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">To the best of my knowledge, my family has lived and was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for 400 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I, at one time, many years ago, went through a certain procedure with the American Red Cross, and they found out how far we went back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and while I was always very Jewish, my nationality wasn't Jewish, my nationality was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">I was born there, my parents, grandparents, great grandparents, I don't know how far back. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">They were all born, as a consequently we weren't Jewish first, we were German first. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I must say, I feel the same way about this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I'm American first and Jewish second, and I think anyone should be that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I think you're <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> comes first. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Who was it that said, "My <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> right or wrong, my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And that's how I feel about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And at the time, I didn't know any different. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I was born there and lived there, and I was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Being Jewish was my religion, which had nothing to do with the nationality at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">See, we didn't know any different. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">We didn't make a special point of being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I was brought up in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> and all of that, and I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , but there was no special em--uh, no special emphasis made out of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">It was just a normal way to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">We have to reload. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Wentworth Films; Holocaust; 7-1/2 IPS; 60 cycle sync; 2/27/92; <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tamarac</span> , <span class="REGION">Florida</span> ; Continuing interview with Edward Adler. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Beep. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Beep. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">People say that Jews went like sheep to the slaughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I'm sure you've heard that. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">How do you feel about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Uh, at the time that the actual slaughter happened, I was already in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">But, I have to refer to a statement I made earlier, when I equate a certain situation with <span class="COUNTRY">Ethiopia</span> , when Mussolini went in there, and the Ethiopians were fighting with slingshots against <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I like to say to the people who make that kind of a statement, that Jews went to the <span class="BUILDING">slaughterhouse</span> like sheep. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">How do you fight machine guns and submachine guns with your bare hands? </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I'd like, I'd like them to tell me how this can be when you're surrounded by hundreds of storm troopers with heavy weapons, and you stand there naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Men, women and children in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">How do you expect to fight back? </span><span class="sentence" id="426">That's a very, very foolish statement. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">They did not go willingly I assure you. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">That's a very, very foolish thing to say, and I get very emotional about that, when somebody says that thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They stand in that <span class="DLF">yard</span> , naked men, women, and children, surrounded by machine guns and submachine guns, and they, people expect them to fight back? </span><span class="sentence" id="430">You don't have the strength to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">You don't have the emotion to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">You are scared stiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Believe me, I know what I'm talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Those people who make that kind of a statement, they have never been in a situation like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Ob-ob-obviously otherwise they wouldn't say anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">You can't fight that. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Whether they wanted to or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But the fight should have started before, when the world knew from 1932 that antisemitism became very, very strong and, and ultimately they must have known or should have known what will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Nobody came to our aid, nobody helped the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">They help everybody else, but the Jews, they're very expendable, they don't mean nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">We had been crossing through----------------5,000 years, and nobody ever came to our help. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And those days, certainly, not, the whole world stood by and, I can't believe for a moment, well, I have to make another statement that just came back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">When the St. Louis, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , the St. Louis, and came into Miami Harbor with 856 men, women and children aboard, and our beloved President Roosevelt sent them back to certain death, back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">What's the excuse for that? </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I mean the president couldn't invoke his executive to aid, to save 856 lives? </span><span class="sentence" id="446">856 lives! </span><span class="sentence" id="447">In this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> of then 132 million people. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And they sent them back to certain death. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And I know people come and ask me why we didn't fight back. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">One thing you said was what a waste of the Nazis did on extermination. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">What a what they did on? </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Waste, they wasted, they spent so much effort and intelligence and effort on... Yes, they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Well, that was the plan after the Wannsee Conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">Prior to that, I don't believe, uh, I don't believe, I'm not sure, I don't believe that it was in the Nazi doctrine to eliminate the Jews as arace. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">I do believe that they wanted them to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">They didn't want the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but I don't think the killing was part of their philosophy at the time, that came later. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So as long, like in my case for instance, and many, many others, many, many others, I'm certainly not unique in any way, uh (coughs), excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">At that time, as I said before, if they wanted you to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , they did let you out. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And many people went to, all over the world, they went to, I have cousins that went to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> because they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> else to live, or nobody wanted them, <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> didn't want them, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> didn't want them, nobody wanted them. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Because we're Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Eh, nobody wants the Jews, they're filth. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">It's a terrible thing, but the world is to blame for that, not one govt. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I don't believe that the killing was part of their original plan, that came afterwards, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">No, no way of proving it, it's just my opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">What happened to your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And, do you want to talk about other members of your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">As I said before, my parents were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">This was my stepfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">My first, oh yeah, let me give you my life story. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">My real father I never knew, so I'm the subject of twice-broken <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , as actually, it didn't turn out too bad really. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">My real father I never knew, he left my mother with 3 children and she never heard from him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I was then 2 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">I never saw him in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I don't what he did, I don't know anything about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">All I know is his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">My mother remarried when I was 7 years old, and there was specific that they did not stay together. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">They separated when I was, it was after my <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> , my bar mitzvah, I'd say I was about 15 years old, so it must have been somewhere around 1925 or so, they separated, and I hadn't seen my father ever in the meantime, except at the time when I got into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> when I met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">MY mother was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">She was shot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I know this from 2 sources. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">First from the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Many years ago we made an inquiry from the --------------, actually, not the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And I also have a cousin who now lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I'm not sure that he's still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">He was an electrician and he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> also and he saw my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">He wasn't killed because he was useful, he was an electrician by trade, so he, he stayed alive, and eventually wound up in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Was married and had children, but I don't know anything about him, but my mother was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> in 1942 I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">My sister was married, had 2 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">She was killed by bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">They found her body and they got her the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">With her husband and her son. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">She also had a daughter that by now must be in her 50s, I would imagine, like my children, or maybe a little bit older, but, went somewhere into the <span class="REGION">farming area</span> , but I don't know anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">When we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> in 1982, incidentally, it's very interesting, we were invited by the German government all expenses paid, including spending money every day, to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">At first, I didn't want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I said, "I don't want any part of this." </span><span class="sentence" id="499">We were in, well, let me go back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">We were in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> in 1972. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And while we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Just for one day, my wife wanted to see my mother's grave, and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And I cracked up totally . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Everything came back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I remember, I wanted take a -----------, we got into the <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> , never forget it, I was terrible, I was terrible, not uh the situation, I was terrible, and the TV wasn't, I didn't know how to put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">TV</span> on, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> , and some German guy you know, came in and put it on, and he said, "Well, you Americans, you don't know anything." </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I threw him out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and I became almost wild. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Couldn't stand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">We only stayed that one day, so when this 10 years later, when we got the invitation to come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I didn't want to go, I said to my wife, "I, I, I, I'm not going to go, I get sick and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Then I reconsidered as time went on, I said, "You know, the hell with, we can take side trips, we can go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , we can go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , we can go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">They paid all expenses. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">The lady that was in charge, I must say, we stayed in a very fine <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">The lady that was in charge was a very, very nice lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">You could really see that she felt what we went through, and that, I mean, the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> had at one time, I don't know, I think 60,000 Jews or something like that, was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , 3 million people, we had about 60,000 Jews, there was nothing left, and all the big <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> that used to be owned by Jewish people are now, have now been taken over by the Nazi party those days, and eventually probably through generation their father, grandfather now owns it or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And this lady felt very sorry for us, she, they, I asked her, "What's the purpose of inviting us? </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Do you expect anyone to change his mind to come back to live here after living in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for 50 years?" </span><span class="sentence" id="516">She says, "No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">That's not really the purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">It is perhaps, to ease our conscience a bit." </span><span class="sentence" id="519">That was her statement. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">We stayed there for I think 10 days, it was very nice, really very nice, the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> is beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">It was 75% destroyed, and after war, through the Marshall Plan, naturally American money, we built it up again into beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , it really is a very beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I asked everything I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Thank You. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">We have to do one other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">We have to, actually we can't do it till the coffee stops perking, probably, thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Your welcome. [</span><span class="sentence" id="529">hope [.. It was very...
