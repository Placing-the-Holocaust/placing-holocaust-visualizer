<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  Well, we settled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> 
QUESTION:  Before you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , what were your expectations of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Well, we had a lot of the idea of the — from the movies, you know, and from the news — there was a newsreel late in one of the movies, so you got the idea of the big <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , and the — and the beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and all of those <span class="DLF">skies</span> — what do you call them? </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Skyscrapers, and you know, like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  What surprised you about life in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> when you first arrived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Well, one of the things that was very su-surprising when I started to read, that you didn’t judge the people by their profession and by what they did for humanity, but with a price tag. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">It seemed that at — the man, 200,000 dollar man. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">You know, that just was very — the people who did so much for humanity or for their <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , had an un — a name tag. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And I see now, I would have — where I live in the <span class="BUILDING">retirement home</span> , many men who are here and they had big positions, but since that price tag is up, they don’t feel very comfortable, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="18">They feel very depressed and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So, that — that’s something for your whole life, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  When you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , who did you come with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  Icame with my husband and a two year old little girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  How did you support yourselves when you first came? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">July 21, 1998
ANSWER:  Well, I really couldn’t support myself because I knew very little English, like please and thank you, good morning and some [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My husband, who was a physician and knew English and some other languages, got a job in <span class="BUILDING">Casualty Hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> driving the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> , and he got 50 dollars a month and <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So with 50 dollars a month my little girl and I stayed an <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> where he paid 12 dollar a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So that’s — because we could not — the only thing we could take with us was eight dollars per person. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">We had 24 dollars with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So that th — took a long time til we were able to — even to move into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and s — and use kitchen facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But you know, we — it somehow, with this Holocaust survivors, I think most of us did not expect that the government or different <span class="NPIP">places</span> will take care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So it was a very difficult time and my little girl and I went to <span class="BUILDING">Americanization school</span> to learn English. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And we met a lot of other refugees and came through <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> with some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And little by little we got to know some of the physicians and we were 1n-invited a lot, and it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">If you don’t — if you don’t — can’t reciprocate, you feel rather badly about. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And we came to visit one of the doctors, and the doctor’s wife said, oh, go up the <span class="DLF">steps</span> , on the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> you put your coat on, and the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">So I looked at myself, I said, what’s wrong with me, you know, is my petticoat hanging out, how do I look? </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But sh — sh —I didn't realize that people want to make you comfortable, as you know where the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> is, or where you can put your coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Th-This is some July 21, 1998 of the things which are not done in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , or — or in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> in a certain class, you know, so — so there were many, many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">It took a long time to be comfortable, to ask somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Now I will ask, oh, you have a lovely bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">If you’re finished with it, you don’t it, give it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Or I go — I dr —I dro — drove by, and — some friend, three in the afternoon and I was hungry and I would visit a friend and I s— and I-—I said, Jean, I’m so hungry, what do you have in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="42">But I had a Visa, I could si— and I had some dollar bills, and I could buy something, but it — it — it was different now, that I could ask people to do or give me something. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But when we first came it was very depressing to have to ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We went in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to try to get sponsors for some family in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and it was in August, in September, it was very, very hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And when we walked into somebody’s and they offered a glass of water, as you did right now, we said no thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We didn’t even want to accept a glass of water, we felt so — s-so bad about ourself that we couldn’t [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So it was very wonderful that so many people gave affidavits. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">They didn't even know the family, or they didn’t — they had the s-same name or something, you know, and — and it was really wonderful the way, particularly the very poor Jews in — the poorer class, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Of course, they had to have a certain income, or a t-tax return to show that they would be able to — to support or — or help — help the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So it was a very di-difficult time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  Did somebody help you and your husband and child come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">July 21, 1998
ANSWER:  Not really, because my husband was registered at the — at — at the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> as a student to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with his professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So he was on the — well, we had, or my husband had family here in — in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">But we — we had a certain pride, you know, and just to take or ask me for something, it’s very difficult.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  When you came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , did people ask you about what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">The pi — the peop — some knew <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> from — from visiting there or from movies and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">People were not so — so interested in — in what had happened, and a — it was very little known, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Even we didn’t know too much about. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We were very fortunate to leave — Hitler marched in on the 13" of March, and we were very fortunate to leave the beginning of July, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So — but my husband had, as a physician, really terrible experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">He could not treat Jewish people at all, or — or in — not — he couldn’t, not Jewish, Gentile people, but Jewish people he could treat. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And he would get phone calls from the family that the husband was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">On — on the following week she received a — at — not a fa — didn’t have faxes that time, a telegram that her husband had died on pneumonia and they have — she would get the ashes back. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So he knew all these and he was very, very depressed, but it was very difficult for him to get ready to leave, much more somehow than it was for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">You know, and I felt for a longest, longest time until we had the first interview that July 21, 1998 you did, I felt very guilty that I, my family, we were able to escape and — here, and I was able, you know, the education that I — that I have to make a success, and so did my husband here, and here my family and — and friends lost their — their life, and — and so I —I felt very, very guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But now, since that — it has changed my attitude since that interview and also I did not realize that I — that I am considered a Holocaust survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I didn’t — never, never occurred to me to be in the same category. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But now I feel that I have a voice, I can do something and I’m very fortunate that I have that Montessori education, or early childhood education that I was doing so much in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , was very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I got the gold medal for my work in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for the — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montessori</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I got [indecipherable] what do you call it, gold medal from the — from the embas — from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I got my citizenship back, and I have a voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Being angry, it — 1t does not help. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So I feel now that since the — all my writing, I have written about 18 — not — not high class and not people who made the best seller list, but they helped the people, the poor people that I worked in <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> to write and be able to vo — to vote.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  I’m going to ask you to pause because you’re running a little bit ahead of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I — I would like you to tell me how you began your professional career, and I’d like you to explain about your background with Montessori. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I-I would like you to take your time and do that very slowly, from the beginning, please. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">July 21, 1998
ANSWER:  Well, w-w — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , you know, after the first World War, we began to ask ourselves, what is wrong with education, what has to be done? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And we were young people and so we wanted to change the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">So Montessori was brought, she was a physician from <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and she brought the Montessori method to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So we all ran to these lectures and got a — a book that sh — the first book she wrote and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And you had, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> you had to do first your exam as a kindergarten teacher, you know, and then you could specialize in [indecipherable] in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montessori</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So I took the — the training, then when I got married, I opened up a <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , and I — cause I had the middle or the upper middle class children. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I did not have the poor — the poor ones as I really had here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So na — when I first came, it took a long time til I learned enough English to take some of the tests that were necessary to establish myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And at that time was the English word against the English [indecipherable] that’s what the — some of — of the newcomers have to learn, you know, that you have to know the language in order to be political active or — or — or — or have a job and [indecipherable] thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So first I got different jobs in special education, because at that time in the early sh — the special education was on the lower bottom of the education. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So — so when I applied they were happy to — to get me to take care of the special class children. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And then they were very surprised the big success, because I was bootlegging Montessori. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I made a lot of material, I use that method of Montessori, and so the supervisor, she used July 21, 1998 to bring teachers or students to observe in my — in my classes and so on, to see what I’m doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Can you explain what 1s different about the Montessori program that you were initiating, as opposed to what was going on in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  For one thing, I did not initiate. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Montessori was here in the early — 1913 she wa — she was here, and there were <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and by 1918 when the war — when the first World War start, these <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> were all closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Montessori approach 1s entirely different, it’s very difficult to explain on — on a few minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  If you could just give a little bit of an idea for someone who does not know about Montessori.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">For one thing, it’s a different layout of a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Children are — are not expected because they’re six years old that they be reading, or three years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">We don’t — we — in aclassroom we have children from three to six, for instance, because a three year old one might be able to read, or a four year old one, but unable to kick a ball or something than a six year one. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So they’re — it’s a such — like in a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">We do a different classroom arrangement. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So we don’t have this is the class two years old, or four year one, we have them — we have now infants’ classes too, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So this is one of the things. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And also that th-there are certain rules and — and regulations in a <span class="BUILDING">Montessori classroom</span> and people in th — it has to work like a — like a society. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">You can — I mean, you have to show them, for instance, how July 21, 1998 to open a <span class="DLF">door</span> and close a <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">How to lift a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and put it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And how — and if you play with something, that y — I cannot come and say, this I want to play now with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So, he learns that he has to ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We have little rugs for the children, and they put their toys on that rug, and this is his <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So they have to learn territorial rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It’s laid out the way, like a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> with the books and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">You just can’t take out a book and then, oh, I want to read the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We have to return it to there, and th-th-then next child can. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So that the — he learns in — the way a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> and the way the whole thing is handled, he learns the rules for society. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So, th-this is a very im — important, and the different expectations for the parents too, to — to understand that, you know”? </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And the teacher is not called a teacher, she is a directress, she directs activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">She doesn’t sit at her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and the children come in, she has to be like a hostess, stand at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , greet the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And as she greets them, says Esther, you have a lovely dress and your hair is done so nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Oh, and you have such a doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And Esther says, oh my grandma came and she brought me that doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So you know from that, that the child will want to walk around the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> , show the doll to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">She doesn’t want to disturb. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And then there comes Jim, and Jim is so sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So he said, you know, teach — some didn’t know, you know, very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">He said, you know, the police came and — and took my ha — my father to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Then you know that this child needs help, somebody to help him to deal with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And so that your aid spends a lot of time because otherwise he’s gonna run July 21, 1998 around, disturbing and knocking things over [indecipherable] knocking things over. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">He — somehow he has to deal with it, but then you assign somebody to help him, hold his hand, take him around and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So that Montessori said like a hostess. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">If she greets the people at the <span class="DLF">door</span> and says, oh, Mrs. Finder, you have a lovely dress today, and — and then you tell [indecipherable] or your husband to go and get yourself a drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">You don’t talk to her the rest of your party, but she will come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she says, you know, Mrs. Finder saw what a beautiful dress I had, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So the same way children know they — they were recognized, and that you knew dealing with their problems or — and also, this teaches sort of manners to the children, to greet people in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Some people talking — were critical when I talked at one of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , I had some black students, teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And he said, oh yes, you come from a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , ki-kings and queens and you shake hands and you do all these nice things. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">But it’s a— a very important thing to be nice, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And so we do a lot training and what you call practical life. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And under that comes also the manners and behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And what is father of the cons — of the — the president, the first president, we had? </span><span class="sentence" id="139">George Washington. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">When he was 15 years old, he wrote a book on manners that is — can be had. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Now, we have — “The Washington Post” has a columnist and she wrote just recently a very great book on manners, the ya — and once I said, like lubrication of your wheels. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">At that time very July 21, 1998 few people have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But so she had a different — so these are some of the things that were — we were teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It’s very difficult to do it, and you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Thank you for — for sharing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">When you first were working and — and showing people the Montessori method, what difficulties did you have explaining or trying to initiate or introduce the Americans that you were meeting to this new way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  The first time when I was called to <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  When was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  That was in the, I think, early 60s or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And it was the War on Poverty, which [indecipherable] I don’t know, so we can — politically th-the time ca [indecipherable] exception. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">So I went to <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> to work with poor mothers and — and poor children. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">The — most of the southerners are Baptists, so — and so we had — the <span class="BUILDING">daycare centers</span> that we opened for the War on Poverty was in <span class="BUILDING">Baptist churches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We could not bring kindergarten teachers in, or — because they don’t want to have jobs and such. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So we t-tried to train the people who lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naches</span> , <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> , was my first assignment, and at that time, Governor Bell did not — he was the governor of <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> and he did not want the — the money assigned for the president to use it. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We came under a different, other th-thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And it was very, very difficult to — to teach these mothers how they could read themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I had to teach the mothers reading and writing and show them on a July 21, 1998 somewhat basically they could — I did not know that I’m all of a sudden a political worker because I helped these mothers, and some of their husbands would come in too, to learn to read and write so they could do the — an-and johns — not Johnson, the Kennedys used to come on weekends and help. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So these people were able to go to the <span class="DLF">polls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And I worked with Charles Evers, who was the first black mayor to be elected in <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And was — so I became a political worker without realizing what just — I didn’t know that teaching somebody to read and write is — is a very big thing that you’re giving. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And ma — my motto 1s the word against the weapon. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">If we will teach people to read and write, then — then they don’t need a weapon to — to get some of the things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  I wanted to know how you got involved with what became what you just said, a political issue, but I — I would like you back up just a little bit and — and go back to the late 40s, and the 50s, when — when there are a lot of things happening, not just in your life, but in — in this society here, and news was coming out in Europe about what had happened during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Can we go back for a little while and then come — we'll return to the 60s in — in a few minutes, but can we go back to the postwar period, the immediate postwar period, 1945, and can you tell me what was going on in your life in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as news of what happened to the Jews in Europe became public here? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">July 21, 1998

<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Approximately when was that? </span><span class="sentence" id="173">You said some of the women had their — their husbands had been killed in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">When did you start some of these training programs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  With what program?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  The — the Montessori training.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">ANSWER:  Well, I really couldn’t tell you exactly the — the years, but anyway it — it — really, when the Sputnik came out in <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> began to ask themselves, what is wrong with our education, that the Soviet take us over? </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So, they looked and they | — and since Montessori was the first woman who was asked to come to the — when the war was over in 1918, to the first conference in peace, and she wrote a little July 21, 1998 booklet, Peace and Education, and she was very concerned about the peace, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So we looked — and then I went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for awhile to take a — a training course, and I went to different <span class="NPIP">places</span> in — in — in Europe, you know, for retraining. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">In the beginning we got a lot of teachers from <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , because Montessori was, for 10 years she was in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , because she was Italian citizen and she would not follow — what was the name in — I forgot his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">What? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Yeah, mo — and then she went to — to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , and then she had — she would not follow [indecipherable] the directions of, what was his name [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So — so we — so finally she went to <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , because when the war broke out the — as an Italian citizen she had — she was for 10 years in <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , and she became a f-friend with Rabindra Tagore, the first who got the N-Nobel prize [indecipherable] Indian, he wrote books and poetry and he was very much involved in peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And also the Indira Gandhi, with Gandhi. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">He didn't — the two of them were not — Gandhi and Montessori were historically living the same time, but also they shared the whole idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">He was for non-violence for adults and she non-violence for children. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">At that time, as we see and hear it now in the newspapers and radio, the children were just suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Perhaps not as much, but they were — they — and when they were eight years old they went to <span class="DLF">mines</span> to work and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So, you see, she was very, very involved in — in — in peace movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And so, this is very important for us in — and to do this, and that’s why I am so happy that my materials and all that is going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , yet, July 21, 1998 w-we — we paid a [indecipherable] we’ll be able to do something towards peace, and also that the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , they realize here is a Holocaust survivor and what he did with that method, you know, they will know something, cause a lot of materials and stuff, I’m working with these Holocaust interns at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , they’re from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">It’s the fourth one or fifth one that I am working, we worked on different things, with the Montessori method and others, how it can be. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So that I feel now that, of the end of my life, I feel, as Montessori said, in the service of the child, that that will go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And, but it also — it will be a separate <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where all the materials and books are being — and films and [indecipherable] si — si — many books, because textbooks are so much written for the upper middle class. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Or they are tested on the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , on the professor’s children. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But there aren’t books and materials for the children who don’t have that background and don’t go to the <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> and all that business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="196">QUESTION:  You just gave me a lot of information, let me just clarify a few points. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">You made reference to your — your books being collected in a university setting. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Can you please clarify what that is all about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  Well, I talked all the time with the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> and with the people from — these interns, the importance of — of education and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">So, I don’t know how it came about, but I — not only that I have my books, but I have 200 books, thi — this — that’s written by other writers and also Montessori was not the discoverer of her method, July 21, 1998 there were two French doctors before her. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And I went — and she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , it’s funny, I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , too, to — at the same — later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And — and I got th-the materials on th-these doctors wrote. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I have Montessori books ’m —?’</span><span class="sentence" id="204">m-—I’m—I taught a class in — 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , so I have a book on — Montessori book in Japanese. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I have the Madonna painted on a silk. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">The Madonna 1s a Japanese, and the holy child she’s holding looks like a Japanese too, and so 1t shows you how universal that method. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We — I lectured in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So you see, this is a method that has some technical ways to teach peace, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  And where are your books being collected for public access?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  The books — the books are here, and I got — for instance I got an — this is Elisabeth who you read about, Gehrer. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">She is the mi — Minister of Education in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">We [indecipherable] have a librarian, a young librarian from <span class="BUILDING">Catholic University</span> and he comes and he has registered — we sent already 14 cartons of books to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , films and different materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> ships this stuff, but it’s packed in my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and the different — I hope to get some volunteers to help, because I have videos and I have a lot of material. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">It’s not only my books, but —and also, there are other books that teachers need to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Now this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that they’re opening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , it’s not gonna be — people cannot borrow these books, it’s they can go and read it there, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And so I hope, you know, that this — this Holocaust — and I’m so happy that, because there’s a — I don’t know if the plans was July 21, 1998 going through to have a — stones with the names on of the survi — of the Holocaust victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">QUESTION:  We have to pause so I can flip the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Just one moment.

<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  No, it’s gonna be in th — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> — | don’t think we have any private <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">This is [indecipherable] which is part of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , people in early childhood education. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And they have different <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> , but mine is gonna be a special <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and it will have my collection in there, but it’s only people can do research there, but they cannot borrow any of the books and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  When do you think that this collection will be assembled and open to the public?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  Well, it’s — it’s hard to say that, and they would like to, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> the Dr. [indecipherable] is in charge of this particular program, the director. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">He would like maybe by September to — but it’s very difficult to get it all shipped and packed and — and also that you have to have lists, and you can’t just go on, and — so I have July 21, 1998 librarian and they sorting, you know, the unpublished papers and books and — and magazines and th-the different speeches that I have given, or other people, you know, that deal with Montessori. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So, it’s ga — quite a lot of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I don’t ever have any <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> now to live in my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , that’s [indecipherable] I’m really working on the —
QUESTION:  How did this project of, you know, with your collection being sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , how did this develop? </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Where did it begin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Two year ago, a—a professor and — and journalist and so on from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Graz</span> , you know, in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , came, she — to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Library of Congress</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And she had heard me speak, and when — when the biography was published and I was there to promote it. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">She heard me speak, but she could not come up to — there were so many people in <span class="DLF">line</span> , she had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So when she came for research she called me, and she would like to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So I invited her for lunch, and we became friend, and she was the one who sort of said, lis — it would be a good idea 1f you would get to know a-and get your material to know in v — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So she sort of started, and I was thinking about it, but I really did not realize it’s gonna be such a big project. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So, let’s see. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Last year, the — the <span class="BUILDING">Austrian embassy</span> gave me the — the gold medal for the work that I did because I worked a lot with these Holocaust interns, took them to some of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish places</span> , I had them for Jewish holidays because they have to learn to know how we’re celebrating them. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And also, I — on all — on all July 21, 1998 the holidays, I — I invite them here to a little meal, my family and friends, and then I invite one or two with — of the Holocaust, or non-Jewish people to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And I don’t want the people to bring me flowers or candy. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Everybody has to write something about that holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">So, even these Holocaust survivors have written very interesting things, and I’ve taken them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Temple Sinai</span> to some — so the-they learning a lot of — of Jewish life, to — and to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And [indecipherable] in my family I have a lot, and two of my granddaughters are married to non-Jews too, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So I’m very interested of this understanding, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So, I don’t know, cause a lot of people come, when they come to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , they come to visit me too, and I — I lived in different things [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But anyway, I don’t know exactly, but all of a sudden th — told the — one of the attaches that I think maybe I have so many books, perhaps they would be interested in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So he asked me, and he made sort of a temporary list and send it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And they were very happy, and so they have already 14 boxes, and that’s just with books and then films, and videos and I have hundreds of beautiful photography of the poor people in <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> and in <span class="REGION">New England</span> , and different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and it — it opens the world to the people here and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> too, because they — they only think <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is you know, the — the rich <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you know, it — on the <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span> , or <span class="DLF">Madison Avenue</span> , whatever they see. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So that — I’m taking that movie attitude away from other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So we started, and I looked for July 21, 1998 somebody to help with the packing, and I got this young librarian at <span class="BUILDING">Catholic University</span> who is very interested, and when he’s off he comes and works a few hours and packs a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And then the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> ships it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  I'd like to go back to your work in the War on Poverty, when you went in the 1960s to <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">How did it happen that you got involved with this particular program, and left your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and did this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  Well, I — a lot of people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Montessori</span> knew me and some people got involved in — in these different issues and — in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And I got a phone call one day, would I come to <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> and introduce a little bit of <span class="BUILDING">Montessori</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So I went down, and at that time in <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> there were different [indecipherable] Montessori, some people were from other <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> with specialties in — in — in their <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So, what — we were hired by the, I th-think one of the Kennedy’s brother-in-law, I don’t know, he was in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Anyway, we were paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So we got to <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> , and my husband, and we felt this is an opportunity to repay something to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naches</span> , <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> , I — I — one of the in — newspapers came down for an interview, one of the Catholic paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And — a-and in there I didn't even remember, but in there I had said I felt when in <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> that I’m back in — under Hitler, you know, the way things were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And then to come to my hats. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I wore hats because I can’t always comb my hair so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So I wore hats, and I have different hats. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And the Ku Klux Klan was very much behind July 21, 1998 me, they didn't want us to come in to teach the blacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">But I heard from somebody who was friends with the Ku Klux Klan too, said we can’t take — we don’t — Hitler didn’t want that little Jewish woman, we can’t do it either, because everybody knows her by her hats. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So that was a — that sort of saved me from being killed by the <span class="BUILDING">klan</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  And every time I’ve seen you, you’ve had a different hat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So people, some people when they go on a trip, my grandchildren or something, they bring me — I have chapeaux from all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And there is a —a <span class="NPIP">place</span> here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , they have only — a— a woman has a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> only with hats. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I shouldn’t nor — need to go there, and see what I don’t have. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">S-So — but I didn’t stay the whole time, you see, in <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> , I did work and to train them, and I would fly back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , then go down again for a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And so it wasn’t that I continuously stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">But you see, my teaching and — and the politic was — was one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Because like I worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naches</span> with the poor people who didn't know how to read, an-and — and Charles Evers, he was — he was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naches</span> too, and he was running for an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So he — sometimes I was up here with him, you know, on — when he — when he was — spoke somewhere, or we have catfish, or [indecipherable] and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So that — you know, so I — I appeared and I was some help, you know, the [indecipherable] thing, and he was elected not because just of me [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">But I was then at the — what’s the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , the July 21, 1998 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">capital city</span> , when he was elected. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">But we did not — our checks came from a different group, not from — from the state of Mississippi, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So many, many things I somehow adopted that Montessori method and I have to rewrite a lot to understand their backgrounds and their needs and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And it was very difficult in the beginning because these mothers wouldn't sleep or clean up. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">They said, oh don’t I know that they don’t have to do these slave type work? </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And I said, you know, but still, you know, we have to clean up. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And then I called the — here the national gallery of art and ask the cur — one of the curators in education, could he send me some paintings that glorify work? </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And so we hung it in the different <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span> , and so they — the “Girl with a Broom” by Rembrandt, they realized now the — somehow, without having ever been to a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , they knew that paintings are something very precious. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And — and [indecipherable] and different paintings and we had it in the <span class="BUILDING">classrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And 1-it — during that time, War on Poverty, they were, you know, the se-senators and congressmen and people would come to <span class="REGION">Mississippi</span> and they would come to visit these <span class="BUILDING">centers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And — and we — I taught them the names of these paintings and — on the — and so when these pa — people came, and these pro-professors and so, and painting, and — and she could say, oh this is, the name of the painting, say something. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">All of a sudden that little black woman without any art education was at the same level as the senator or the July 21, 1998 [indecipherable] and she knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So the arts plays a stellar role too, in the many things that I have done in the art.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION:  When you said they sent you paintings, they sent you what, copies? </span><span class="sentence" id="296">What — did they send you posters? </span><span class="sentence" id="297">What did they send you actually, when you requested this for this — for the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> ?</span></p>

Mrs. Schroeder came, and she is a journalist and so is her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And she came to the German club and said, I know I don’t July 21, 1998 need to learn German, however I want to know what makes you guys get together and speak German, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And somehow, after a year or so she was there — she asks her husband, and she asked me did I want to do a book, because from what I was saying at the <span class="BUILDING">club</span> , or somehow she thought that I have — we — I had a story to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So it was a — quite a decision, and also you know, I did not — I hadn’t planned, you know, and — and a lot of dates and stuff like you are asking me. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I’m a— mathematics wasn’t my strong forte. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">So, 1t was v-very difficult, but as a journalist, I mean like he went to — they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> when they were doing the — and they found the <span class="BUILDING">coffee shop</span> where I went to, and they found the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> I went to, and they brought photographs and — and they got 1-1in — <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> pu-published every year, every month what’s happening and every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So he found the 1905, what in July, had happened, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And there were similar things being —

an interview on — in some newspapers, so — we could establish some days where I went or what I did, you know, from the newspaper clippings. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">But this — my memory 1s not so — so good any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">In particular for dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">But, as I say, what — they were able, you know, to search through newspapers, and si — and there are some books and there’s a chapter or something about me said in — in there, on the War on Poverty people who wrote books, so in several books was something about me or July 21, 1998 my work, you know, so — so that’s how it came. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">It took a long time, and — but unfortunately it isn’t translated into English yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">That bothers my grandchildren because they never learned any German because my daughter was so — she would not want to have her children on Hitler’s language. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So — so the — course there’s not enough on Montessori in there, and — well, you can’t di — you know, write so much when you live a long life as I did, and — but I was so fortunate as a title, it — the book, I was very lucky that what I did, 1t was a success, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And had some — everybody lives a life and has some sad things, but c’est la vie, and it doesn’t have to — just to sit and — and feel sorry for oneself, that I lost my daughter and I had to take care of my grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">But I’m very lucky, they all did not go on drugs, they finished their education, they are married, they have children and they are working and I can be very happy with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And that my work that I did is successful — was very successful in that it’s a — a [indecipherable] and we’ll find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I feel in a way it will constantly remind people when they go there to visit, that this Jewish woman was a Holocaust — what the <span class="INT_SPACE">Holocaust room</span> , even if they will not have everybody’s name, but somehow I feel with the videos and with th-the — everything is going to be there, that it will be some — 1n paying something back that I did not suffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">But I feel it — that the work that I have done that is being — being used, it will tell the story of these people that I did not know and that had to suffer and — and die such a terrible death. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">So I feel that really I have to be grateful July 21, 1998 particular to Spielberg that his first video that made me feel I have some <span class="NPIP">spot</span> in that history and I have done something with my life, and that I have in some way, is — 1s — I wanted to dedicate this memorial to these people that — that I don’t know, and some names I know. </span><span
