<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Where were you born, and when?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Leo, tell me about your childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I want to know about your family first.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Well, my family, uh, was...I had, uh...two brothers and a sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My father owned a very small <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> for supplies, uh, shoemaker supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">We were not considered on the poverty level, but, uh, we were comfortable before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">private Jewish school</span> , because my parents believed in, uh, a Jewish education--but secular, not religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">We were never strictly religious; but I would call ourselves traditional Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">When the war broke out, uh, I was eighteen years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Let's talk a little bit more before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I want to know something.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  Tell me about...what was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> like, pre-Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Well, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial city</span> , about the second largest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">It was...it had a large Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I'd say about a hundred and seventy-five thousand Jews used to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> [NB: in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Uh, most of the Jews were concentrated in uh...in one <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">It was voluntarily, because they...they like just to live.... It was just, I would call it, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">voluntary ghetto</span> ; because they like to, to stick to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">They...they had a cultural life. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">There were three <span class="BUILDING">Jewish theaters</span> , three daily newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">It was a <span class="BUILDING">publishing house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">It was <span class="BUILDING">Jewish schools</span> , which I attended one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">It was also a very active religious life and a political life. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Uh, it was swarming with the unions and, uh, political parties. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">It was really a bustling Jewish life, in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">A lot...most of the Jews were in <span class="BUILDING">textile industry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Uh, many of them, uh, used to take out work from the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , and they did it at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ; and by the end of the week they'd put it back together and they'd send it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">It was those...uh weavers, hand weavers, mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">It was a large industry in...in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">After I finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you know, for a Jewish young kid, it was uh.... In, 1n our class, I could not afford any higher education. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I went to learn a trade, as an apprentice. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">What...[some (ph)] went as weavers, tailors, shoemakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Well, I choose to be a tailor; and for a few years I worked as an apprentice even without getting paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Just for the benefit to learn the trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And later on, I start to make a little money. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And then come the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">War broke out, I was about eighteen years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Tell me what happened the day the war broke out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Well, I remember...to, to talk about the outbreak of war, we have to go back a...a few weeks before. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It was a war situation--like a war fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We felt in our bones that war, war is coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">They dig <span class="DLF">trenches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">They took away the young people to the...to the army; and we, we knew for sure that war is going to break out any...any day. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We were preparing for war. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We know. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">It's nothing we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We uh...we heard in the radio--for example, in our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> it was two radios, and people were getting together to listen to the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">It was not like uh we know today, that every family has a radio or TV. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">It was one radio in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and it was enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">This, this was our contact with the world; and we heard the the speeches from...from Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">We, we heard the...the speeches from Polish officials, and we know that any day we're going to be 1n the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And sure enough...I remember like today. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">It was Friday morning, September the Ist. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">We heard that this is war. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And uh the same day we, we, we heard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> already; and three days later--it was the 3rd of September--it came uh an order over the radio that all young people should move, get away in...towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , to the east. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Because the Germans are approaching, they will need us to go into the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And we, we...we packed our few things and we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I left my mother and...and my sister behind; and uh the men--even my, mine ten year old brother--what also we were going to...towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Like the order said. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">We found out later that this was a German provocation. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">The...the voice on the radio was not from the Polish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It was from the German government, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Uh the Germans made...tricked us; and they want to jam the <span class="DLF">roads</span> so the Polish Army would have difficulties to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And sure enough...when we came on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , we saw what's happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">The, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">The the the the the troops couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Everything, every <span class="DLF">road</span> was jammed with refugees, with people going towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">On the way--it was not far away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , just uh several kilometers--<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> start to bomb us. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We...and many of those refugees were killed, right there on the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">In a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near... outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , [Bierzyn (ph)], it was like one huge <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> ... refugees [ (ph)] laying all over the <span class="DLF">fields</span> --uh, injured, dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And this was our first day actually that we experienced the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And uh whatever we took with us, uh we had just enough food for a day or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Soon we found out, little by little, actually there is no sense of running anymore; because with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German planes</span> controlled the <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">They controlled the <span class="DLF">skies</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">It was no defense whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Even the Polish army was disorganized. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">They could not understand where they had...they lost communication with each other, and we decided--uh, I mean, me, my...my brother, my father--that there's no point in running. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Maybe we should return back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> , to...to our family, to the mother that we.... And after another day, uh we decided there's no point in in running any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And we started to...to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">On the way back, we met already the...the Polish Army like uh uh...like they would quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">There's no point. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And we came back...this was, uh...we came back by Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">It was...actually it was a Fri...the following Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">After a week, we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And the same uh evening, the German, uh, patrols already came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ; and it was a Saturday when they marched in... into...to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">At that day, we all stood and watched. </span><span class="sentence" id="92"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> also had a large German ethnic population, and immediately they came out and start to throw flowers and candy at them, to welcome them, finally, uh...like they would be liberated by the German army. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">For us Jews, the nightmare started that day; because, uh, here and there we saw already Jewish people were beating [NB: beaten] up. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And uh even our Polish neighbors took advantage of the, you know, the long antisemitic feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They had a chance now to display, because nobody would protect any Jew anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And uh, religious Jews were caught in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and beards were shaved off. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Uh, some beards were teared out from the faces, to the point that blood came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And Jews were caught in the <span class="DLF">street</span> like uh dogs, and taken to work uh in doing all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Every German had the right to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">The civilian German population, the ethnic Germans, uh immediately they...they took out of the swastika armbands and they put on; and they became the masters of the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Uh Jews used to own in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They...everything was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And uh they they also threw out Jews from <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , better looking <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Immediately every German had the right to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">He just came in and said, "Get out!" </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And they took over and it...all the rights were taken away immediately, the first day the German troops entered the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">A Jew had no right whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And uh at...by us, we...after a few weeks uh official Germans ca...officers, they came into our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , to our...even to the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , the big <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> that we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And they gave us five minutes to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , to leave our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ; and my mother said, "Where should we go?" </span><span class="sentence" id="110">He said, "You should...." It seems that he understood that question. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Uh he said, "I would suggest that you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ba_uty</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="112"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ba_uty</span> was a...a section, a very poor, it were the slum section of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">He visualized that this is going to be the <span class="REGION">area</span> for Jews to live, where Jews would be forced to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Uh so my mother start packing. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">He said, "You don't have to pack. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">You just take uh the...your, your coat, and you...you take just the bread, the food that you have. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And you leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Otherwise you will be thrown out." </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So my mother said, "But uh we...we have a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I have to take a few things. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">My little kid, you know, he'll needs clothes." </span><span class="sentence" id="122">He said, "Well, if you stay and talking, what there's now you got only three minutes time." </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So my mother run to the...to the...to the <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> , you know, and she start uh to pack. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And then he saw that there was a fur coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">He said, "No, this you're going to leave." </span><span class="sentence" id="126">He didn't let her take. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So we took just a few things. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">My father took uh a box of tools; so he went over and checked the box of the tools, and see if there is not anything uh is not hidden under there. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And so when we were about to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...you see, my mother stood there by the...by the <span class="DLF">door</span> and looked around our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And then he said that she should take off the pearls that she wore. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So she took off the pearls and throwed away on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And then he made her pick it up from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and put it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> ; so she took the...the pearls from the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and just throw it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And we walked out from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and here we stay on the <span class="DLF">street</span> with no <span class="NPIP">place</span> where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So we start walking to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ba_uty</span> , to that section. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And there already was some kind of Jewish organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">They call it the [Geminde (ph)], the [Gemeinde (ph)]; and they took all the refugees from--because they knew that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> are coming to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> --and they gave us some kind of a <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And we did get an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> through the Jewish Council in that, in that section. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We did get another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">It was a one- room...we did not have a big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">It was two, two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> ; but here we got <span class="INT_SPACE">one room apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And please, we were so lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Everybody envied us that we still had a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over our head. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And we start...we made that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ; and later on, a few months later, this was the official section for Jews to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And Jews were ordered from all of the sections in in the in the part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where we used to live, to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">When we...we were a regular...thrown out actually from one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ; but then all the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> were ordered to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And it was like an exodus, you know--like another war, where you could see through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to the, to the...to the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , storming people with their belongings, whole families. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">They took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> and make uh little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">They took everything they could and load it up on those uh <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriages</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , and it's on backs; and they stormed into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And that's how the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">It was a very small part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , mostly <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And that's how a hundred and seventy-five thousand people were crowded 1n, in that uh.... <span class="INT_SPACE">Rooms</span> had to be shared for families. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We, we were fortunate enough to have our own <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We didn't have to share with nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">It was that time uh...my, my father--I forgot to tell you-my father at that time took some of the belongings and...and went to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where his his sister lived and.... Just to put it away there. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And by that time the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed, and you could not come back; and he was separated from us all through the war and we never saw him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Uh my brother decided, one brother of mine that's younger, decided that uh he will try his luck and go to that part of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> ...that <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> occupied, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> by the name of "<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bia_ystok</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Well, actually he told me to come with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So I just couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">My father was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And he...he went away because he had arrangement with some friends; and he tried to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bia_ystok</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Now there was my mother, and a kid brother only ten years old, and...and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I just did not have the heart to leave them. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And I decided to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And by May the Ist, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was...was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And was like...like a big <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> , <span class="DLF">barbed wires</span> around, armed guards every few feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And this was our...our life, that time--1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">How did we live? </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Everybody still had some, you know, money. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And there is, there was some food to buy here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">But we could see the writing on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , what's going to happen next month, and a month later. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">The Jewish Council that was formed came up with an idea that we should organize <span class="BUILDING">shops</span> and work; and this was the... the plan that the the elders of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> uh came up to the German peo...to the German authorities: that we have tremendous resources in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We got shoemakers--experts. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">We got tailors. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">We got weavers. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We got such good craftsmen that maybe we can interest German industrialists to use, to make use out of those talents. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And they did, for their...for their own reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">This, for them...a chance to have a big bureaucracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">They wouldn't have to go to the Front. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They employed a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">It's still better to guard Jews than to go to the Front. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And uh and this was going on for...until 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But conditions were worsening with every month, because it was less and less and less food. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">You see, we understood that the German people...the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was designed, actually, to starve the people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Uh if the if the war would last another ' According to Hilberg, the order to close the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was issued May 10, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">See Hilberg, The Destruction of the European Jews, vol. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">1, p. 223. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">ten years, they would liquidate the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> without firing one shot; because the statistics showed that every month more people died and died. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Uh from families that used to be five people, there are only three; because people were dying out...and getting sicker...and getting smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And we could see they emaciated up to nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">People start to look like skeletons. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And it came to a point that people couldn't even work; and the work was (cough) compulsory. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We have to go work. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">If you miss a day of work, you get less food; because the, the, the <span class="BUILDING">place of work</span> provided one soup a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So if you didn't go to work, you get one soup less. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">You have to just make with that little food that you got from the monthly rations.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">When we get up in the morning, all four of us, we had to prepare for work. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I start off with...with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">My mother worked at a...at the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they used to, to, to... fuel, to distribute the fuel for the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">It's a.... So she had to go to work in order to get that pot of soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">My sister went to work in a...in a...a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they used to make shoes out of straw; used for the German army on the front, so when they stood guard they shouldn't freeze their feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So those big shoes she used to make out of straw. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">My little brother worked in uh one of the <span class="BUILDING">tailor shops</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> ; he was a runner. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And I went to work as a tailor in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> for uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">When we came to work 1n the morning, we start...we started uh by...by the machines, of course, and we were making the German uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But uh the minute I sat down, un...until we finish, that's all it was in my mind at that time is twelve o'clock when we will go, we'll have a break and we'll get something to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Because I was constantly hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">The...the hunger didn't leave me, because the little food that we had at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> uh in, in the morning--it was one piece of bread that I ate in the morning, and the se...the other piece I took with me to have it in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And I...I kept it in my pocket, or I kept it in in the pot that I took with me for the...for the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Everybody had a little pot with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And we could not wait; and this was everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">The whole day, it was in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">In the meantime, work has to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">It was strictly controlled. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And twelve o'clock, the minute we have the break we have to... everybody was running for the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">This was the major event in the...in the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">After work, we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Uh if it was summer, it was bearable. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">In the wintertime, it was no fuel. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">It was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Uh, most of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> was gone already because we break, broke it up and burned it just to keep warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And the minute we were ready with that little supper that we had from the...we, we finished it all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And then we went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , to...even just to keep warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Uh, and this...when it...most of the time uh, we stood [NB: stayed] in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">The summertime, when it was warm, we used to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">We also had to go to stay in <span class="DLF">line</span> for the rations to...to get. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And sometimes uh the staying in <span class="DLF">line</span> meant hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And me being the...the man of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it was up to me; because I would not have my mother standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> , or my sister or my little brother, but it...1t was up to me to...to bring in the food from the rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And uh it was very little left for social life. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Me being eighteen, nineteen year old--for some people this is the golden age. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Uh, I spent my eighteen and nineteen and twenty years in...in the ghetto of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Always hungry, always tired, uh overworked, and with no hope for the...for the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I didn't see any hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Later, after a few years, I got involved in...1n, in some educational project. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We started to...to write. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I particular was interested in writing something about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And I developed some... people say that I did develop some talent for poetry, which later on it was used by some Jewish dramatists like [Jonah Stogow (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I was also at one time involved in teaching Yiddish, because I was a student of the <span class="BUILDING">Yiddish school</span> in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , of the [Medem (ph)] school. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And we taught. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">It was...this was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">It was not allowed to teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">My students were not the children, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">It was young uh girls--uh, at the age of fifteen, sixteen-- who were interested in knowing, because before the war they went to <span class="BUILDING">Polish school</span> and Yiddish was strange to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they got that chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">They considered this part of the social life; and also beneficially, because they learned a language. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And to me, it was very rewarding, very satisfactory for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And for the...for a few years, actually, I did that kind of teaching in Yiddish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  You told me before about a particular man in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> who was particularly cruel. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Would you tell us about it and tell us the name you knew him by?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Uh it was one German guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">He took some pleasure in abusing people physically. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">It was a part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where you used to cross from one...from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> to the other, under guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And this man many times stood there at those <span class="DLF">gates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And uh if he didn't like somebody, or he went too fast, or he didn't take off his hat in the right way, or he'd walked too slow, he went over to him (cough) and he punched him several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And that's how (cough) he got the name of "The Boxer," because he used to box people. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I looked at that man several times, and somehow he registered in mine brain. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">At one time-- it was in 1942, before that action that we used to call the "Sperre" [Translation: "Closing," "Closure" (Ger)]|, that we were ordered for eight days not to leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they selected all the people that got too weak to work anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The children--it were illegal to have children in...in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">The sick, the olderly [NB: elderly], that they considered useless people. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">But that...before this action actually started, they...they...all of a sudden, they attacked the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">They came in like a surprise, and they surrounded the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And like wildfire the news spread that the Germans surrounded the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> on <span class="DLF">Lagowniecka Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Before the war, this used to be the ...the....also a "ambulance"--like social...<span class="BUILDING">social medicine station</span> [NB: perhaps "ambulatorium" (Pol), an outpatient facility of a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="271"><span class="BUILDING">Kasa Chorych</span> [NB: former National Health Service]. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And we run over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">It so happened that one of my friends was a patient at that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ; because he had an attack, they took him to that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And when I heard, the first name that came to my mind, "Oh, my God, Josek Feldman is in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> !" </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And I run over and stood there. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I still had an hour before going to work, so I stood there for the hour and watched. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">What I saw, it's hard to describe, even. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Wagons standing below the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and nurses bringing out the patients and put them on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Uh some patients going on themselves; like uh I saw them, they're going to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And then I saw from the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , they opened the <span class="DLF">window</span> and people were throwing out sick people into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And who is there conducting the whole operation? </span><span class="sentence" id="282">That "Boxer"! </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Well, after the war at one time I read in the paper that somebody is looking for me, that the the.... It was to the Jewish World Congress that were looking for me as a witness for that "Boxer." </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Of course, I immediately replied; and I was called to the German Consul in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> and I was told that somebody gave my name that I know what happened in that...1n that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I said, "I certainly do." </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I still don't know until today who gave my name; but I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I testified against that "Boxer," which I found out that his real name is "Krisom" because that's how they referred to him, "Herr Krisom." </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And I was asked by the prosecutor to...to tell what I know about him; and I told them the story about that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , what's happened in that...in that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Uh, his lawyer asked me a question, if I know for sure that the people were thrown out from the <span class="DLF">windows</span> into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">He said how do I know for sure they were thrown out? </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Maybe they jumped out, out of fear, when they saw the troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">They jumped out by themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">So my question to him was, "How about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="293">People on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And also: belongings, packages, suitcases, bottles. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Altogether were thrown out into the.... And then another question was put to me: "Weren't you afraid to stay there and watch all this, with all the Germans around--with that 'Boxer,' that you call him, around? </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Weren't you afraid to stand there? </span><span class="sentence" id="297">You told me that he used to beat up people he didn't like." </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So I told them that I think that they wanted us to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">If they wouldn't want us to stay there, they would chase us away. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">They want us to stay and observe all that fear, all that cruelty, that I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Then the only defense was, from the lawyer in that same, that I mistake him for somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">They never denied that such action happened there by the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">The only defense was: maybe it was somebody else, not him. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And sure enough, this was forty years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I said, "Looking at that man I don't know if this is the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I only know the 'Boxer.' </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And if he was the 'Boxer,' he was the man." </span><span class="sentence" id="308">They showed me pictures from the past. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I recognized him immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And then they showed me different kind of hats that he wore, and I picked his uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I picked his cap that he wore, and it was established that he was the one. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And then the defense went--not referring to me, but referring to the prosecutor--that it was a cruel war and every man in the war had to follow the orders, and this was the orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">But I establish one point: that that action...that this man, Herr Krisom--or that one that we called "The Boxer"--was in charge of that operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  When and where was this trial?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  The trial was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bochum</span> (Westphalia), <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">It was outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="317">It was in 1978. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I don't recall the exact date.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Let's go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">QUESTION:  Are there any other stories or incidents that you remember from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> that are important that you want to tell us?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">ANSWER:  Well, the most important is during the liquidation when we were running from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , we were trying to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , not to go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Because to go away to nowhere, to a unknown <span class="NPIP">destination</span> , it's frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">We don't know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">They...
QUESTION:  Tell us...excuse me, what...what happened leading up to the liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so we know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">The the people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was taken out constantly...five hundred, six hundred, thousand, and they...we were told that they going to be resettled in a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">That they need--for example, at one time they need strong people, so they took all the strong men and they put them to work, and they send them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">For a while, their families used to get a letter or two--even money paid by the by the Jewish Council in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto--</span> to make us believe they're working someplace else, and that's is the pay the family is getting. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But after a while, it stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">There were no more letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">No more money. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We didn't hear about them; like they were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And a few months later another resettlement program. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">They took away other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">They need another five hundred, or six hundred, or...or a thousand. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">It was little by little. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was getting smaller and smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">The population dying, and putting...and sending away. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Until it came to a point that everybody, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , is being liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And everybody was going away. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And ...and this was the the time that we tried, we tried very hard to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">We hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">We built even uh <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> underneath, uh underneath <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">We...we kept on running; because uh it looked like uh the minute we leave the the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from there, that there's no <span class="NPIP">place</span> left for a Jew to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">They even promised us that that we were going away we can take our tools. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We can take machinery with us to establish ourself in the new <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">But the question was: What is wrong with this <span class="NPIP">place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Why, why do we have to be a new <span class="NPIP">place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Our...this is not <span class="NPIP">paradise</span> that we are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">They promised us a huge amount of food at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Everybody will receive a whole loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">This was a treasure. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">It was like a bait. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">But still we were...we would like to stay in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , because one precious thing was left to us--the family was together. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And this we felt, it's going to be...the minute we go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we're going to be separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">The men probably will go to work someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">We did not imagine anything worse than that, that probably the men will work in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">The women will work in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and the...the youngsters will work someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">This alone was frightening for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And it came to a point uh that they used to hunt there from <span class="DLF">street</span> to <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And transport was formed every day, and going to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and sent away. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">People among us working at those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , they told us what is going on at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and how the people are packed 1n those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Unhuman conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And the question was: if we were sent to work, to do some work, and that's how you transport people going to work?
