<p>ANSWER: None</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And where were you born and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I was born June the 10", 1929 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Speyer</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Let’s talk a little bit about your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Tell me about your parents and their background, how long they had been there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  My father was one of the religious leaders in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , he was also the cantor cum rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">He was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My mother was a -- a young woman who married -- in her day, who could -- never had a career, of course, she married from her mother’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , married my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">He had been married before, he was a young widower, as a matter of fact, when she married him. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">She -- how they met I never knew because there was some romantic story that she had gone to visit a friend and he met her and he fell in love with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I don’t know, I’m sure that’s about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Probably a blind date. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Anyway, they married, they had one child, who died. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My sister died when she was 10 years old, which was a devastating event for my January 4, 2002 parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And, as a matter of fact, if it had not been for the death of my sister, I probably -- my brother and I would not have been born -- we were twins. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So in considering my father and his philosophy, he -- it had to be somewhat ironic for him to have lost a child and then have twins born. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">At any rate, that’s how we arrived, and I think we had a n -- very nice life, a very nice <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Stable. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I mean, I felt no anxiety or fear, at least not until I was about five years old, when it became more difficult to be a Jew in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and | think that’s an old story. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And the children, I think, more than the adults, began to react to my brother and I as Jews, even though there were still children who were not Jewish, Christian children who would play with us, because there was a <span class="DLF">park</span> in front of our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I had Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I was a child that had -- my brother and I -- more m-me, because my brother was very well behaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I always had the feeling that I had to be very well behaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I was a special child because of my father and certain conduct was expected of me, so that was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">It was a very religious home. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My father was a relig -- 1-1-in -- in the sense that it was strictly Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My mother was, I think -- I don’t know how sh -- exactly what her beliefs were, but certainly she -- she upheld whatever my father wanted to do in a -- in -- in the marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">She was a very nervous woman because of my sister’s death. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I think that was a terrible trauma for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So when I think of what ultimately happened to my mother, it’s unbearable to think that this woman who had January 4, 2002- ended up her life the way it eventually did. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And that I find probably the most unforgivable thing about this whole situation that happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And let me say now, at the outset, that what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , while it was unique in the history of the world, notwithstanding great sieges, great battles and great suffering among other peoples of the world, I have come to the conclusions after many, many years of thinking about it, that whatever happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> could happen anyplace, given certain economic and cultural events, and that it is singularly inappropriate for -- for people to be smug and say well, you know, this is -- these are the people that were able to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I think all peoples are capable of doing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  What were your parents’ names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  My mother’s name was Anna Rosenthal Greenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">She was born Irena Bayata, but they called her Anna. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">My father was Benjamin Greenberg and they called him Benno Greenberg.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  And -- and your brother’s name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  My -- my brother’s name was Heinz and he was my twin and he now lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> and he’s a grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So I mean, you know, it’s wonderful, when you think about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  And tell me a little bit about your late sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">What was her name and what did she die of? </span><span class="sentence" id="41">January 4, 2002</p>
<p>ANSWER:  My -- my sister’s name was Margot and she was absolutely exquisite, I have a picture of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">She was angelic. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Not only because she died, because people become angelic after they’re dead, but from -- everybody said that she was just a sweet and gentle child. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And her death not only devastated my parents, but I think my mother’s brothers, her uncles and my -- my grandmother, and I think that -- she was really beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I mean, she looked like the Rosenthals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Wha-What did she die of?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Diphtheria. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">She was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">They had sent her to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to reco -- recuperate, and I think from what now that -- I was in the <span class="DLF">medical field</span> a little bit for- for a long time, she -- I think they must have given her digitalis to strengthen the heart, and I think they o -- overdosed and I think it killed her. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">She was only 10 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">So I think that’s precisely what happened, although, you know, it was so long ago, I mean, was 1928, so it’s difficult to -- but they did bring back the body from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> -- it had to be a -- a frightful event for my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And -- but as I said, you know, my childhood was pretty normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I was -- after the -- do you want to hear this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  Well, let me ask you a little bit more before we get to the --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  -- the -- to the -- the 30’s -- https://collections.ushmm.org January 4, 2002</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">It was a very nice <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , you know, each <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was individual, had land around it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  You were right in the center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I would have thought it was more -- it was not a big -- I mean Speyer is -- 1S -- it was a fairly well known <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , it had a very famous <span class="BUILDING">cathedral</span> and it had the Speyer Diet..there was something with Luther that was there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I think it was more toward the outskirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">It was a very residential area and there were lots of Jews living in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">There were some Christians too, but they would have been across the <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And there was a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">church</span> not too far from us and then there were a cluster of <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> there, too, that I think belonged to Christian families. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But where I lived, our neighbors were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">The interesting thing was that maybe 20 yards from us, around the corner, was what is known as a -- it was like, not <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> for soldiers, but like a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that housed soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">You know, army soldiers, not SS or Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And that was very -- that was strange, because 1-it -- right in -- in this <span class="REGION">area</span> they had what is called a -- a -- I don’t remember what it was called in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- in https://collections.ushmm.org January 4, 2002 German, but they had soldiers living there, training, being trained there. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So I used to watch them when I was little, and we -- they were very friendly then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  You had mentioned extended family. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Did you have quite a bit of relatives, cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  [had a grandmother who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gimbsheim</span> , where my mother was -- where my mother was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">My mother had two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">One was a bachelor all his life and came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in the late 30’s, 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And she also had a younger brother who was married and I had one cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And then there were various assorted second cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">My mother -- my grandmother was widowed when she was like, in her late 20’s, from -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And -- but she had a brother who came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Now, I have family that live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wichita</span> , <span class="REGION">Kansas</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So, I mean, you know, it’s the old story about emigration and -- and -- and families and intermarriages and -- and -- but we -- we -- it was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I -- I -- it was a nice -- it was- it was a nice -- it was a nice life for a child and certainly it had to be for my parents, you know, because they had a position in the community and -- and that wa- that was --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  You said your father was a cantor, was that his full time work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Work, yeah, plus he was educating all the young -- youngsters. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He also educ -- you know, he also had classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He also trained all the boys for their Bar Mitzvahs,January 4, 2002 plus he had <span class="BUILDING">Sunday School</span> , that he ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So that’s why I’m sa -- once -- th-that’s why I said initially, my problem was that I always had to be on such good behavior, because of him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  How would you describe yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Were you an independent child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  I think the word brat would probably come to mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Well, I -- I think the one thing I -- that I learned and that I love, and I think that made it much easier to cope with me is I loved to read. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And once I discovered books, I think I was easier to cope with. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Before that, I -- I didn’t understand what I did that made it -- made me always get into trouble, but I did, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And my mother would say, Margit, please stand up, Margit, please sit still. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">You know, the usual things, you know, that children do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  Were your parents Zionists?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  My father I am su -- I didn’t understand what Zionism was, but certainly he believed in the state of 1 -- of 1 -- not -- at-at -- <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , absolutely, because I heard him talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They were firm believers that Jews had to have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And he was very, very much aware of what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because he told my -- my mother’s brothers both to get out, and they listened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">He could not leave, they would not let him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  We’ll talk about that also in a little while -- January 4, 2002</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, sure.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I read, I played. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But I would think that reading was my great passion, always and still is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  What about sports?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  I wasn’t very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I mean, let me put it to you this way, when they would choose people to play, after everybody else was chosen they’d say, well, we’ll take her, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="115">That was the final choice, nobody really wanted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But I -- it didn’t bother me because I-I loved it, even though I was so bad at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I mean, I played badly, but I loved doing it and I was always thrilled when they even would include me. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So that was -- sports was not my forte, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  Did you have a special relationship with your twin brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  Y-Y -- no. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Yes and no, we fought a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Oh, I did te -- take violin and all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You know that my father was very musical and had a wonderful voice and he played like umpteen instruments, well. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So I learned how to play the violin badly,January 4, 2002 because I really wanted to play the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , but my brother got the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , per usual, he got everything, you know -- know the old ch -- my brother was a -- is and was a very gentle, sweet boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I was really the monster. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I mean, h-he -- it wa -- it -- definitely role reversal there somewhere, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But yeah, we got along fairly well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  Well, in the beginning we went to a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> -- I mean, public -- sort of <span class="BUILDING">private public school</span> , like they have in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">It wasn't a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> like they have here, it was a small <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">But then eventually, when things were very bad, we had a tutor that came from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and taught all the Jewish children in -- in -- in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Speyer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">He came every -- every day.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Did you have any non-Jewish friends --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  Oh yes, I had always Christian friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">As a matter of fact, I got a letter not too long ago from one of them, and I should -- I se -- I’1l send you -- and she goes to my sister’s <span class="DLF">grave</span> and she makes sure that it’s still taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So I mean, she -- yeah, I did, and I loved them. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And they still played with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I mean, some of -- some -- I mean, my mother, for example, sent me to a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> to learn how to knit and embroider because she and her -- my grandmother threw up their hands, they couldn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And they sent me to the nuns, and I learned how to knit and I learned how to embroider. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I had a nun there who would sit there and tell me wonderful stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And it was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I was a Jewish child. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I was the child of a -- a -- Dr. Greenberg and nobody ever thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I also had a laundress who came -- we had a laundress who brought laundry back -- back and forth every week. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I went to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I had ham sandwiches, and I -- my father found out, he was a little excited, but I was never very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So, I mean I -- those are the kind of things you said how I got in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I knew I shouldn’t during Passover eat bread, let aloneJanuary 4, 2002 cold cuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So I mean, that’s the kind of troubles I was always in. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But it was, as I said, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I mean, I loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I would go with my -- I would go to the nuns and they would teach me. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So there was a lot of interaction between a non-Jewish community and our family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  And favorite holidays that you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Anything that stays out in your mind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, I remembered -- I always liked the holidays, I did not like Passover, ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I hated the Seder, I thought it was endless. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I wanted to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">But I liked Rosh Hashanah, I loved Yom Kippur, because I was allowed to eat lunch, and then I loved breaking fast, because they used to make something called Pergelfleisch. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I don’t know if you know what that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It’s -- it sounds horrific, it’s called pickled beef, but it is the most wonderful thing in the world, nobody’s ever makes it, nobody knows how to make it in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And I looked forward to that and having bread and I like the -- I like Saturday night dinners, except Swiss cheese. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">My father once said to me why -- why do you -- Margit, why do you hate Swiss? </span><span class="sentence" id="173">He s -- I said, I only like the <span class="DLF">holes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Now those are the kind of things that did not endear me to my mother.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  German. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">A little French, but mostly German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">QUESTION:  And why French?January 4, 2002</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Because my mother liked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">But I mean, we’re talking about phrases like n’est-ce pas, or you know, comme il faut, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We’re not speaking -- I me- | mean, I’m not talking about real, real conversational French.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  Well now let’s begin -- when did you first hear of a man named Hitler? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I mean, you were born in 1929, so when did you first hear --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I think when I was five -- five, six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">It’s when -- when I first saw the uniforms and I saw marching through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and then --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What -- what do these uniforms mean to a five year old?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  Oh yeah, yeah, I -- it was, but again, 1t was much worse after Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">After Kristallnacht it became flagrant. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And then -- let me say that at the time, you a- also -- after -- even after Kristallnacht, there were still people who did not, in any way, react to us in a negative way, who became overtly anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">The people who were really anti-Semitic were always anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Now the children were the surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">The children who became so -- who became, you know, really taunted us and began -- made life so difficult for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Those are the ones -- the mu -- most of theJanuary 4, 2002 u -- most of the Christians ignored it, ignored us. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">They might not have been friendly, but they were not overtly -- they were not overtly cruel or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">It was the children more than anything else, and some of the teachers.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  When -- when did this happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Was it before Kristallnacht?January 4, 2002</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah, it happened before Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Maybe -- I’m trying to think, was it before? </span><span class="sentence" id="233">No, I think it happened after. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">There were things that were happening before, but after Kristallnacht it all came together. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">It became a -- it became now a government directed persecution and I think it became -- and -- and -- and now the rhetoric was geared up so high. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I mean, you know, we -- we -- the -- the -- the -- the- the vendetta against Jew -- Jews, and the fine -- resolution became now a par -- a -a--a--anaim, a political aim. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And it became -- and I think -- you give people enough propaganda and you tell them and you repeat something enough, even they wa -- they want to believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">If they have any dis -- I mean, today in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , if you have a minority that somebody dislikes, if you give them enough power and justification to react to that minority, they will do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And Hitler gave people the right to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">He gave those children the right to hurt us. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And he gave those people the right to burn down the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> and to arrest people and to murder them, and let the oth -- and let -- and let them -- and let the -- the people stand by passively and allow it to happen, because he made them feel that this was okay, that they -- he was absolutely getting rid of an -- of a world evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">That he was destroying a hydra-headed monster called a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So it -- that was permissible.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  And how did they handle it?January 4, 2002</p>
<p>ANSWER:  They themselves didn’t know how -- what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">My father only knew one thing, that we had to leave, that it was done, that we had to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">That -- but he couldn’t, he could not get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">They -- he was refused the visas, he was considered a political prisoner and he couldn -- but he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I mean, he urged my cousins, he urged my uncles, he urged everybody to go, they all left. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">They all went. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">They went. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">He knew that there was no survival.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  Prec-Preceding November ’38, was his work at the nu -- at the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> affected at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  No, that continued. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And I'll tell you something else that was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">One of the priests tried to -- wa -- on -- during Kristallnacht woke him up to tell him the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was burning, they ran down and saved the Torah. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I mean, you know ya -- I mean, the -- 1-in all -- in the midst of absolute evil -- and I use that word in its true sense, there are people who took an interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I remember walking with my mother while my father was in the -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and I met one of my nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I had -- was noJanuary 4, 2002 longer going there, you know, because I think it was difficult for them, they couldn’t- | mean, anybody who had anything to do with a Jew was at risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So I remember she bent down, she kissed me, and I had this overwhelming feeling of sadness, because sh-she ha -- the tear rolled down her cheek. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So I mean she -- they all -- we all knew, I mean everybody knew that we were condemned. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Nobody knew about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">My father knew <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> existed and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> existed, but nobody understood what the ultimate plan was. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I mean, nobody could -- would have believed it, except that my father knew that the ultimate plan was to kill everybody, and he wanted his family out. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Now, I think my mother -- and this is something I’m not sure about, but I do believe from what I remember as a child, that my mother could have left, and she refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">She stayed with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So I -- you know, I think she could have gone with her brothers, because they were leaving, and my grandmother could have gone too, and they chose not to go, they chose to stay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  Could she have taken you too, the two of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  Probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">But for some reason she wanted -- she didn’t do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">She didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">She condemned herself, effectively, to death, and probably us too, although I don’t think she really believed they would kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I don’t think any mother believes that her children are going to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">But I think she could have gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And that -- for knowing my mother as I know her, it -- as I remember her, it -- it -- she was such aJanuary 4, 2002 delicate, as I said, nervous woman, for her to have made that decision had to take enormous courage. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I mean, for her to know that she was going to stay in this horrible <span class="NPIP">place</span> where, you know, when everybody else was starting to go, you know, I think it had to take enormous strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I don’t know if I could have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I don’t know if I wouldn’t have said, I -- I’m sorry, I -- I’m taking my children, I’m running. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I think it takes a very strange love, belief, confidence in your mate, or not being willing to leave him, you know, to -- to face it by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I -- I -- he -- she did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I think that- that -- that’s one of the remarkable things about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</p>

Let’s now talk about Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">What are your memories of that specific time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  I think it was probably one of the major traumas in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">First of all there was the burning of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , which while I -- I must say, being a little brat, as I said, or a child, for one glorious moment I said, oh thank God, I don’t have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">But then I -- then even -- e-even I understood that this was not a good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">But then they came to arrest my father.</span><span class="sentence" id="308">January 4, 2002</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Wer-Were you awake at night? </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Whe-When did you first become aware what was happening?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="312">QUESTION:  This is in the middle of the night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And then when he came back at five o’clock that morning, I heard again, a lot of noise, and I ran downstairs and I -- I mean, I don’t think they had gone to sleep, I mean, nobody did. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I mean, my father was still dressed, and he had burned his hand, and I think he had -- was wearing like a bandage on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And the SS had come in and they were arresting him. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And my mother -- this is -- and my mother was hysterical, everybody was hysterical and I started to become hysterical because I didn’t understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I must say the SS again, this is the contradiction in human beings, when they saw me and my brother, they tried to reassure me. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">They said, itll be all right, your father will be all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And of course they were very polite. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I mean, there was nothing of the sturm and drung kind of thing that you see in the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">They were very calm, very icy, very -- you know, waited for him to get hi -- you know, put his coat on and everything, and he was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Now, once that happened my mother did everything to get him out, once we found out where he was, how -- the January 4, 2002 police kind of told her where he was, or somebody told her. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">My grandmother and my uncle all tried everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And I'll tell you a story that sounds like something out of a movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">My mother took -- told me to get dressed one afternoon, and I -- were t - |-I was dressed, and she took me by the hand, and she had her pocketbook, and in her -- and er -- and she was holding a little chamois bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And I’Il never forget the -- and I remembered what she wore. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">She wore a -- she had a magnificent blue coat with a blue fox collar and she wore that coat with a matching blue dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And we went to the police, and we sat <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and waited, and I had no idea and for once I was very quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And then she -- they told her to come in and we sat in front of this man and he wore a black uniform with the SS -- I mean, the swastika on his arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And my mother said to -- they were talking and then she opened this little bag and she too -- put all her jewelry on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and she said, you may have it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">She said, I would like you to have it, she says, if you can get me -- if my husband come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And I'll never forget what this man said, he looked at -- my mother was a very pretty woman, and he too-took her -- the jewelry and he put it back in the bag and he handed it to her -- of course it was all gone eventually anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And he says, I cannot take it, he says, but I will -- and I ca -- he says, I will try to do what I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and about three days later I heard footsteps coming down the <span class="DLF">street</span> toward our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I knew it was my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I woke up the whole January 4, 2002 <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I start screaming, I said, Papa’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , Papi’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And everybody says no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">My mother says, what? </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I said, he’s coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And sure enough, the <span class="DLF">door</span> rang -- there was a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , we all flew, and there was my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">He had taken -- he -- as he left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , he had given his jacket, his overcoat, everything he had to the prisoners that were left, that would never come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And he had a white- he wore his white shirt, he was very thin. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">My -- my -- my mother, of course, wept. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">We put him into -- he went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I remember during the morning -- this was very early in the morning, was maybe 5:30 - six o’clock in the morning -- everything in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> happens either in the middle of the night or early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">That seemed to be their best time, you know, like the vampires, you know, do well at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Anyway, I remember tiptoeing into his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to make sure that he was there, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And I remember he looked at me, he says, Margit? </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I said, are you all right? </span><span class="sentence" id="352">He says yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Of course he wasn’t, because he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">You see, my father then knew that ultimately it was all downhill from then. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I mean, you know, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , everything had stopped, the tutors came. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">They were -- the families were trying to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Of course, the families that ended up going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gerthe</span> with us, stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">They did not get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And I still -- of course, and there were still a lot of people who really believed that this was some kind of nightmare, that something was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">But then the united -- I mean, <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> went to war. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">January 4, 2002</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  Did he tell you anything about what happened while he was there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  He said it was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">He says there were a lot of people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">He said there were a lot of young men there. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And he also said that that time that they were not getting out, that these were people that -- I don’t think they had <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> then, but these were really prisoners -- not all Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I don’t think they were all Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">But he said the conditions were horrific. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">There was hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Of course he was so thin when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">There was already hunger, there was already a lack of food, there was lack of warmth, it was very, very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">That’s why he left all his clothing, as much as he could. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">The conditions were very bad and obviously he knew, he sensed that they were gearing up for something very big. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And he also found out that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was just one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="377">There was also <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And he was -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsen-Belsen</span> wasn’t there yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">But he was -- he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">He had heard from what -- he -- he told my uncle, who had come to visit him right before he left -- he left for -- for -- for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">That’s why I know that my mother could have probably gone because my uncle came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to see his sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And -- January 4, 2002</p>

<p>QUESTION:  So these are Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="861">January 4, 2002</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Mm. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">So in some way they collabord way -- collaborated with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Now my question has always been, in what way? </span><span class="sentence" id="864">I mean, what did they get, how did they escape being interned? </span><span class="sentence" id="865">How did they escape going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="866">How did they survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I mean, it was like the French collaborators, you know, who -- who -- who- like, you know, who sold the -- themselves to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And this is what these people had to have -- have done, because they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">The Christians is another story, you know, but these were Jews.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Do you remember their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="884">ANSWER:  Yeah, that’s -- no, but Gunter Katz -- one of them was called -- was Lehrer, like te -- like teacher, and his name was Lehrer, but I don’t remember his wife’s name, but Gunter would remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">He absolutely would remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">And --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So these people had nothing to do with your being chosen to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="887">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I think that came from the -- I think that came from a much -- from an international kind of decision by the United States and other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and other countries. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">No, the people that took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> were probably -- I -- I mean, took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marjelier</span> were probably people who were sort of a liaison with all these different programs that had -- they were trying to get some of the children saved, and that we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marjelier</span> and I was very bewildered. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And I -- you know, when they said it was a <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> , of course, after I -- I read all these books, I expected Cinderella, you know, with a -- well, this was not the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I mean, this was a big, big <span class="NPIP">place</span> with a huge <span class="DLF">entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And very barren, very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">Not -- you know, it was set up to take care of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I mean, it was not set up to be a <span class="BUILDING">salon</span> or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And there were lots of children there already. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">We were just more. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">They had teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">They had -- they had ver -- they were very good to us, I mean, they were very nice to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">TheyJanuary 4, 2002 spoke French mostly, and that’s how I learned to s -- really speak French much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And they tried -- they tried to be really -- they really tried to educate us. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I think that was one of the big things, they wanted to continue our education and we did go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Now, they gave me a little plot of ground <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for me to plant my own vegetables. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">Well, that is the s -- I mean, I can not even grow a weed. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">So I was the only one that nothing ever grew for. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">They were -- they -- they were -- they were nice to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">I mean, there was not -- I mean they were not gushing and they were not affectionate at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">I think they were doing a job, and I think they were also aware of the fact that most of these children were going to be leaving, hopefully, and that new ones would be coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">When they finally -- now, there were children who were grieving terribly. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">There was a child that came whose mother died in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="910">She was an only child. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">She -- her mother -- she was in my -- she was in -- in - in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="912">QUESTION:  And the mother died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">ANSWER:  No, the mother died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but she was the only child of this mother who was either divorced or widowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">It was the most wrenching thing for that child to leave her mother and for that mother to let her child go. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I -- I mean, I -- I have children and I’m sure you do too. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">I keep thinking of handing my child up on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , 10 years old, or 11 years old, and in this little c-ca -- girl’s case, six years old, and January 4, 2002 saying goodbye and letting them go down a <span class="DLF">road</span> where you don’t know where they’re going. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I mean, my father said <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I don’t think he knew himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">The courage it had to take, and not to weep, and not to -- and to control yourself and not let the child see how s -- how anguished you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">This mother did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">This child looked like frozen, like a piece of glass when she sat down. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">She was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Black curls all over her head and she wore this little clean dress that her mother had saved for the occasion and she was sitting there and weeping, I me -- I me -- like a piece of stone with the tears just falling down her cheek. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And terrified, I mean terrified out of her mi-mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">She’d never been alone, she had never left her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And she -- she was so quiet, you know, she -- her mother had -- must have impressed on her -- she was not in our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , that she had to do this, she had to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And she had accepted it, but she didn't want to, you know, she kept saying -- and then that night she kept calling for her mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">I mean, she was a little child. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And th-the teachers would come out and they would talk to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">As I said, they were not overly affectionate, not doting. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">They couldn’t be. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I mean, there were so many children. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="957">ANSWER:  On the list of transports from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gurs</span> , and I have that here, and -- but I’m going to have to send you copies of all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Which means -- which is a horror to me, when I think that 1f my grandmother -- I have the death certificate for my grandmother from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and if my father did die before my mother left for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , that meant that my mother went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And that I find unendurable. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">I’m hoping that if they went, they went together. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">But 1 -- I don’t think so, I think my father did go to -- did die there and never got to go -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> -- and for him it’s a blessing and for my grandmother certainly it’s a blessing, she was a woman in her 70’s, so -- but for my mother I find it -- and I’m hoping that if -- you know, she did go, that there was somebody with her, that maybe the Alcons were still there, because Truda said her -- of course her parents died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="962">So maybe all the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Speyer</span> were still together then, you know.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="2063">QUESTION:  Sexual abuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="2064">121January 4, 2002</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah, there was. </span><span class="sentence" id="2065">There really was, and that’s something my children did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2066">I think I told Bonnie once a long, long time ago that sometimes things hap -- but I mean, it was limited, let’s put it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="2067">I mean, you know, but he certainly tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="2068">And except I was so frightened, I didn’t know, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="2069">And when I told Walter when we were married, he was going to go find him and kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2070">And you know, I said, that’s not an answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="2071">He says, how could he, you were 12 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="2072">I was, I was 12 years old, but I was, you know, starting to develop and -- and it wa -- it -- it happened when I came back from the <span class="BUILDING">convalescent home</span> , so I was already almost 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="2073">Because I went to the <span class="BUILDING">convalescent home</span> in 1942, and si -- and I was going to be 13 in June. </span><span class="sentence" id="2074">So, it happened around that time, and it didn’t happen, you know, very often. </span><span class="sentence" id="2075">But I just knew he fondled me and I didn’t understand that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2076">QUESTION:  Did -- did you report it to anybody?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2077">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2078">QUESTION:  Did you say anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2079">ANSWER:  I never told Mrs. Beser, whom I saw once a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="2080">I never told a soul. </span><span class="sentence" id="2081">And I did not tell a soul for years and I’m telling you for the first time, except maybe my daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="2082">I just never talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2083">It -- now, you know, now of course it’s wonderful cause girls can talk, but in those days, who would have believed me? </span><span class="sentence" id="2084">This was a very respectable man. </span><span class="sentence" id="2085">They would have thought I was making it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="2086">Nobody January 4, 2002 would have believed me and for years I wouldn’t say anything, I wouldn’t have said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="2087">Because of -- the chances are that somebody would have thought it was -- I was lying and I was -- I was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="2088">And as I said, he never really harmed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2089">L -- it -- when I told Walter, he believed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2090">I mean, Walter knew that I would never, never lie about something and I -- just there was no reason for me to. </span><span class="sentence" id="2091">Look, I had a t- | had a doctor once, and -- who became very famous, his name was Edgar Berman. </span><span class="sentence" id="2092">He wa -- became a famous surgeon, he took my tonsils out when I was 16 years old, and he was doing something with my -- on my boob, I thought it was part of the exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="2093">It wasn’t until I was married that I understood that this is not part of an exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="2094">But he was doing it, talking to me the whole time, never paid any attention, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="2095">And so I mean, wi -- girls, you know, I -- we don’t -- that -- that didn’t upset me at all because I thought it was -- I had been examined so much in my life and I had so much blood taken and so many EKGs taken and so much stuff, that I just thought it was something new for the tonsillectomy, that 1t was part of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2096">And it took me, when I was married, about three fo -- I never told Walter about that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="2097">I told him enough abou -- but I, you know, I think most young women have an unfortunate experience somewhere along in their lives before they are married, that somebody tries something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2098">So it is nothing unusual, nothing exceptional happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2099">It was not a rape, it was nothing brutal like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2100">It was just a guy who was, IJanuary 4, 2002 think maybe not -- I wouldn’t call -- certainly would not have called him a pedophile. </span><span class="sentence" id="2101">I just think he was -- I was a young woman growing into maturity and that wa -- and I was in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , probably, you know, running around in -- in a slip without thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="2102">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2103">Again, we tend to blame ourselves, there’s no excuse for his behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="2104">But that’s what happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2105">QUESTION:  Do you get reparations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2106">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="2107">I never knew I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="2108">No, because first of all, I didn’t have loss of -- I didn’t have loss of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="2109">The Germans -- the French are now paying for the loss of my par- mother going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , they’re willing to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2110">As I said, they’re giving 80,000 francs, which I haven’t gotten yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="2111">My brother did, but I haven’t yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2112">QUESTION:  What -- what about your father, the loss of your father, they don’t --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="2113">No, no, no, no, why would they do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="2114">They pay for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2115">There are no reparations from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2116"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> only did it for property, and I got something for my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> years and years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="2117">Probably I mishandled that -- my brother and I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="2118">But, you know, the thing is, they -- they did pay reparations, are you ready for this, to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> -- to these -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , is they sent <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Mercedes-Benz</span> , mer -- that -- I could never understand that, why did they do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="2119">As -- as an atonement for what they did?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="2126">QUESTION:  Wh-When they were younger and you hadn’t told them the whole story, what did you say to them when -- about not having grandparents? </span><span class="sentence" id="2127">How did you present it to them, before you told them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2128">ANSWER:  I told them that their grandparents were dead on Daddy’s and Mommy’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="2129">Both of them died in ur -- both died in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="2130">And then as they got older I told them that both their p -- all four of their grandparents died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> -- Walter’s did, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="2131">So, I said, this is what happened, and then they began to understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="2132">I mean, you know, they un -- my children are unusual in the sense they had four grandparents die in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2133">Walter’s parents died too, and so did mine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2134">QUESTION:  Have you been back to Europe at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2135">ANSWER:  I’ve never gone back to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="2136">When I stood dramatically with arms stretched out like Rose in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Titanic</span> saying, I’m leaving, remember this moment, I meant tt. </span><span class="sentence" id="2137">I was not going to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="2138">But I’m ready now. </span><span class="sentence" id="2139">Again, you know, it ta -- it took January 4, 2002 me -- I’m a little slow. </span><span class="sentence" id="2140">But I told the children that I’d be willing to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and see, and go back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , you know, and see something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2141">And I’d like them to see th -- first of all, from a thetic point of view, it’s the -- it’s a beautiful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and there’s no reason for them not to see it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2142">And thank God they don’t have those memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="2143">They’re gonna look at it -- they may look at it with some sorrow for me, but certainly from their point of view, it -- it -- wa -- wa -- there’s no -- there’s noth -- no anguish there for them, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="2144">I mean, they don’t know th -- they never knew their grandparents, so it’s fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="2145">I want them to see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2146">It’s- yeah, go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2147">QUESTION:  What -- this is some time ago, but what were your thoughts during the Eichmann trial?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2148">ANSWER:  That they couldn’t hang him high enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="2149">I mean, my feelings for mist -- well, the thing that impressed me about Eichmann is number one, the way they got him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2150">And my fervent regret that they never got Mengele. </span><span class="sentence" id="2151">But I also felt that he represents to me what I said again earlier, that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , under the right kind of Fuhrer could absolutely revert right back to 1932 without any question, because Eichmann was totally, totally unremorseful. </span><span class="sentence" id="2152">He was -- did not regret one thing that he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="2153">The only thing he regretted is that he was caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="2154">He had -- he -- he felt absolutely justified in what he did, which is the -- the horror of the whole thing, is -- 1s what I's -- wa -- January 4, 2002 you know, how can you do this to another human being, I asked? </span><span class="sentence" id="2155">Well, Eichmann thought that was absolutely justified. </span><span class="sentence" id="2156">That is what’s so terrifying. </span><span class="sentence" id="2157">Not that these people did things that were aga -- went against the grain. </span><span class="sentence" id="2158">These people did things that they felt were for the greater good of -- for all. </span><span class="sentence" id="2159">This was for the greater good of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2160">They were doing by the -- the -- the -- the -- the ends justified the means- or the means justified the ends, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="2161">The point was that they felt what they had done was the thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="2162">And that’s what’s frightening. </span><span class="sentence" id="2163">When people do things that go against them, somewhere they begin to break down. </span><span class="sentence" id="2164">Somewhere their conscience begins to catch up with them, but not if you really believe you’re doing the right thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2165">Then you just go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="2166">And Eichmann sat in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> in frozen, like glacial calm, because he was right and they -- his -- th-the people, his accusers, were wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="2167">He was convinced of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2168">And he went to his death believing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2169">So Iam convinced that if tomorrow morning a new regime -- I mean, look what the Germans have continued doing to the Turks. </span><span class="sentence" id="2170">I mean, whatever their doing to their -- to foreigners, it 1s there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2171">That absolute belief that somewhere along the way, they have achieved some kind of superiority. </span><span class="sentence" id="2172">And that everybody else is really just a notch beneath them.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="2215">ANSWER:  Well, the only other -- I don’t have another thought besides Braun. </span><span class="sentence" id="2216">The thing I think that I would like -- if anyone ever listens to this ramble, the only thing I would like them to n -- remember is that vigilance -- and I’m sure they’re going to hear this on every tape that is in -- in this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , that vigilance is something that Jews and all people need. </span><span class="sentence" id="2217">That human beings need to take care of each other, respect each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="2218">I’m not asking them to love each other, because that’s really hard to do, but at least have respect and trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="2219">If we have a sense of trust of each other, even if -- when https://collections.ushmm.org January 4, 2002 there’s betrayal, and there is bound to be betrayal between peoples, but if there 1s sufficient trust left, we can survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="2220">We can’t survive without it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2221">And I think this 1s the most difficult lessons for man to learn and he hasn’t learned it yet, we haven’t learned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2222">We have not learned it in this year of 2002, we are -- you know, the -- let me end up on a note ma -- of a man much wiser than I will ever be. </span><span class="sentence" id="2223">Thucydides wrote a book called “The Peloponnesian Wars.” </span><span class="sentence" id="2224">And the book was written, I would say, 1500 to 2000 B.C..
