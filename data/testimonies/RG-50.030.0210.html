<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you please state your name and your birthplace please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name 1s Richard R. Seibel retired Colonel in the United States Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born and raised, and still live, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Defiance</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was ordered to active duty from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Defiance</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> , in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I reported for active duty June the 9th.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Would you give us little information about your background and your childhood in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Defiance</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Well, I would say that my background 1s that of a normal school child, 1f you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I played, participated 1n all sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I lived with my father and mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My father was born and raised in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> when he was 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My mother is a native Ohioan from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Defiance</span> , her ancestors were some of the original settlers in <span class="REGION">Northwest Ohio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I spent my entire life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Defiance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I was the director of purchasing at a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Defiance</span> when I was ordered to active duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Do you have brothers and sisters?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Yes, I have two brothers, and they are both deceased now. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">In fact, they both died in the same week. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And so I had a funeral for each one of my brothers in the same week. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Prior to that I had another brother and sister but they were deceased when they were very young so that I never knew them. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">They were about 2 years old, I guess, when they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I spent my entire life...I joined the reserve unit and somebody said, "Why did you ever join the reserve?" </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And I said, "Well, I felt I owed an obligation to my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and my family and my God and that's the reason I was in there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="22">They said, "Yeah, but if you hadn't been in the reserve, you would have never been in combat and war two.” </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I said, "Well, that's beside the point.” </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I joined the Reserve, no prior military experience and I did it all by correspondence, if you will, and association with the Ohio National Guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And I recetved my commission as a Second Lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And that was in 1934. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And then I remained in the Reserve, which was nothing at that time, until I was ordered to active duty on June, the 9th, 1941, 6 months before Pearl Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I was then ordered to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Knox</span> , <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> , which was quite an experience, I can assure you, because it was the training center for all of the selective service people. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We trained all of these people for a period of 13 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Then comes Pearl Harbor, and the <span class="DLF">roof</span> fell in, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Things changed completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">All the guards that had been on duty in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> previously had only blank ammunition, and from that time on, they were issued ball ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">All civilian clothing was sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and the entire training was stepped up and it was changed from 13 weeks to 11 weeks because we were in a hurry, if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And that is when the entire military concept of training and combat and everything else changed, from that time on. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I was sent on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop train</span> shortly after Pearl Harbor, probably 2 weeks after that to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ord</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> , with, as I recall, about 250 trainees who were being deployed to the Pacific. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And the <span class="REGION">West Coast</span> , they were scared to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Believe you me, they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">They felt that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> were going to come in, but they never did, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And so that was the beginning of extensive training for combat in World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Shortly thereafter, I was ordered to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Poke</span> , <span class="REGION">Louisiana</span> , to a new division, the 11th Armored Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">We started training in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Poke</span> , <span class="REGION">Louisiana</span> , with all new troops and from thereon, we went to Louisiana maneuvers and from there we went to the <span class="DLF">desert</span> for desert training, and from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Ord</span> ...or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Cook</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> , and then from there overseas to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and from there to <span class="REGION">Continental Europe</span> to meet the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">That is briefly my background and our training in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was prior to crossing the <span class="DLF">channel</span> for combat, and we were ordered in the combat...we had crossed the <span class="DLF">Channel</span> and landed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cherbourg</span> , and we were supposed to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nancy</span> , to come up from the south, and that's when the ball changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And so we were immediately changed from going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nancy</span> to go through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Meuse River</span> to prepare the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Meuse</span> ...all the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Meuse River</span> for demolition. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We were not to contact the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">The Combat Command A on our left was supposed to probe, and not to meet them in any fire fight of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So we then crossed, and we went in through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neufchateau</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And it was shortly thereafter that we hit that Bulge head on and we got hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I don't mind telling you. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">But we had good people in our organization, well trained, and then we caught our breath, if you will, after that first engagement and continued on, and when through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luxemburg</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , into <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , a short distance and back out, and into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and that's when we wound up with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  When did you first arrive in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I don't know for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">01:08 It probably was the latter part of April of 45 because we were stopped, and it was May the 5th, when the <span class="DLF">restraining line</span> stopped us which 1s across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> from...we were across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">River</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , in the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> , which was Hitler's birthplace.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  What did you say...what caused your stop at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  The <span class="DLF">international restraining line</span> the agreement was made at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yalta</span> between Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt where they divided Europe which <span class="DLF">Berlin Wall</span> was a result, plus the occupation of all of <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">That, in my humble opinion...of course, that's all changed now, was that's the worst thing that even happened in Europe, was that <span class="DLF">international restraining line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">01:09:
QUESTION:  How did it come about that you came across the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  We sent a patrol out in a effort to keep in contact with the enemy or to contact the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And since we couldn't go any further than the <span class="DLF">restraining line</span> which was approximately a mile or so on the other side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> that's how we found it, because we were probing and that's about the best I can say is that in our attempt to keep contact with the enemy or contact the Russians, here was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  What happened after you came across the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  We had this patrol and the patrol leader called in by radio and said that we have across something that we are not sure what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">It's a big <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> of some kind, and there are people running all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I said, "Well, is there any combat or shooting of any kind?" </span><span class="sentence" id="64">He said, "No.” </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I said, "Well, you return. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Bring the patrol and come back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And they reported into the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and told me roughly what it was, and so I reinforced the patrol and I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And that is when I made a complete inspection and came back and reported into General Degar, our division commander and told him what it was, and it was shortly after that report that he said to me on the telephone, "Dick," he said , "You will return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> and take command.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  What did your patrol tell you they found?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Just a lot of people, lot of bodies, lot of people running around. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">There was no control of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">These people were strictly on their own and no one knew what was going on or what the situation was. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Really and truly. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They were like lost sheep.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  So you went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> yourself for the inspection. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">What did you see and what did you inspect?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, all of these dead bodies piled up, like cord wood if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Sick people, dying people, starved people. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And you take to an American such a sight as that, you can't imagine it. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Things like that don't happen, but they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And so we were actually and truly...the people that were with me, they were all dumbfounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And when we went back the second time, I went in and went into the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> and the Russian major who had been a prisoner in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="83">He was sitting behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and through an interpreter, I asked my interpreter to ask him what he was doing there? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And he said well, they were in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They were going to run it, and they had all ready established a tribunal for the death of certain people. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I said, "Will you please tell him that this is in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> , and that we are here and we are occupying the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and it's our responsibility and we're going to run it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And he still wouldn't leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So I (laughing) I pulled my pistol out and I reached across the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and I pointed it right in his face and through the interpreter I told him to tell that so and so that if he didn't get out of there, I was going to shoot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And he and his party left immediately. (</span><span class="sentence" id="90">Chuckle) And so that was our initial on the takeover of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">My interpreter who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ...he's a Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">His name 1s Primisol Dovias, and he remembers that to this very, very day 01:14: because he and I correspond rather frequently and he a short time ago was telling one of his Canadian friends about what had happened, and I had letter from this (laughing) Canadian relative to our takeover and Primisol's part of the takeover.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Did you inspect the physical surroundings?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  What were they?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  Terrible shape. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">The SS, when they left they disrupted the <span class="BUILDING">power plant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We had no lights, no power, no water, no sewage, no sanitation of any kind, and that is exactly what we found and we had to get that cleared up fast because of the health of the prisoners of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Not only that, but my own people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  What did you do to straighten it out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  I wouldn't allow any of my people to handle any of these bodies or clean up any of the feces that were around or anything of that nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I had all the prisoners do it, and I got one person from each nationality. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">There were 21 nations represented in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I got a representative from each <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> to pass on my wishes and desires, if you will, to the people of his own nationality so that they knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Now, I think it was the second day. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I'm not sure about this, but a fellow came in...one of my people came in and said, "You better come quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">There's trouble out in the main compound.” </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I went out and here's four bodies on the <span class="DLF">street</span> with their throats cut. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">There was fighting among people so there was only one thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We got everybody inside the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> by force with bayonets if you will to clear the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , to get <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We started at 8 o'clock in the morning and with a representative of each nationality, we segregated that entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> by nationality, got them...Germans altogether, the Russians together, the Poles together, the Czechs together, the Spaniards, the Italians, all of the <span class="REGION">Slavic countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">That stopped the political problems that we were having with the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because they were fighting among themselves, and so we put a stop to that real quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">We, fortunately or unfortunately, we segregated in <span class="BUILDING">internal prisons</span> inside the main compound all the Russians and all the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We would not let them associate with anybody else because they were troublemakers. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And so ...there was a Russian General came in into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and he asked me why I kept our Red brothers locked up. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And I said, "Well, General, ...by an interpreter.., of course, I said, "You tell your people when they learn how to act, then they can get out, but not before.” </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So that's some of the problems that we ran into which we never expected because we thought we were the great white liberators you know, and we're doing a tremendous job for these people, but it took them a long time to realize that we were there to help them, not to hurt them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  How many people did you have to administer in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  Eighteen thousand in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We gathered up about 700 bodies, which we had to bury. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We had no identification of any kind, and we buried them in the old <span class="DLF">Sports Platz</span> , which was the recreational area for the SS, playing soccer and baseball or whatever they played. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">The bodies, there were no identification on any of these people, and no one could identify any of them because some of them were in terrible condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So we buried them in a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> , about 700. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">We put a cross up over each <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Of course, they were buried without benefit of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span> or anything because we had to get rid of those bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And from that time on, anyone who died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> received a cross or a Star of David, with their names on it, and they were thoroughly and totally identified, but prior to that we couldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I would guess that there was something like 1300 people died while we were there, and they were all identified properly so that all records maintained their nationality and their name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  Did you bring in medical facilities?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  We brought in two <span class="BUILDING">field hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Huge installations! </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And anyone who had to be taken care of was assigned to these <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Our medical records show that we had hospitalized, while we were there, about 5,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And as soon as they were able to leave the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And that's what we did until until the bulk of the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Now when I left there and my people and I left, there was only about 3,000 or 3,500 people left. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And they...the bulk of those people didn't want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And there were quite a number of Jewish people left in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that did not wish to return to their homelands. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">In checking with these people, the older Jew wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">The younger Jews wanted to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , or to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And so those...I don't recall how many there were, but those were the ones that were left and the other people just didn't want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Period!</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Were these Jews that didn't want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or were these other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  Other people that just didn't want to go back to their homelands. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">A lot of them were afraid to go because of what had just happened and what they had been through. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Until it settled down. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Now I don't know...I do not know the results of the 3,500 people, but I know that I was told that they had in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , I think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced camp</span> for Jews, and all the Jews that were left in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp were</span> all sent to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced camp</span> in I believe it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">At least it was 1n <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Were there any special problems that related to the Jewish inmates particularly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I had no problems at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">In fact as I mentioned to you previously I did not recognize a Jew as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">He was a human being just like anybody else and therefore he was treated as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We did our dead level best for him to forget his past We put all of the Jewish population in with their own nationality because I didn't feel that they should be segregated like they had been previously and so mistreated, that we put them in with their own people, all the Germans, the Hungarians or whatever they might be, whatever their nationality. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They went in, but they didn't go in as Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  Did any of the Jewish population have any feeling about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  They did, but then they got over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I had a lot of pressure put on me from the Zionist organization from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> , why did I do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  And I told them very plainly why I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And but they couldn't quite understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And I said, "Well, may I say that you people have been persecuted for which I am very, very sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">But I don't want that to persist in this camp or have any feelings of persecution previously. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I want your people to be a part of the rest of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  You told me a little story about a Hungarian Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  Oh ..Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">A Hungarian came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">He spoke excellent English and he asked me, he said, "I want to ask you why the Jews are not kept by themselves in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And I told him, I said, "Well you people lived outside the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">compound</span> in <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , cold and you were treated very, very poorly.” </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And I said, "I don't want that to happen.” </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I said, "You are human beings just like anyone else," and I said, "What's your nationality?" </span><span class="sentence" id="170">He said, "I'm a Hungarian.” </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I said, "Therefore, you will be housed with the Hungarians, not with just Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Well, it took a little time for him to let that soak in. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I told him, I said, "Now, I want you to understand this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I said, "I'm from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States America</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And I said, "If you lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you would be an American.” </span><span class="sentence" id="176">In my book, you'd be just an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">You're not a Jew, because this is your religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Judaism is your religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">If you are in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you'd be an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Period!" </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Well, 1t took him a little while but he finally recognized my feelings and whether I was right or wrong, I stuck with it right down to the very end, and I would not change my position at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Even though a lot of pressure was put on me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  Were you aware of any dissention among the survivors in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> within each nationality?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">The politics that existed between the different nationalities was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I couldn't believe it and the rest of my staff, we couldn't understand why they were so-called fighting among themselves when they'd been under this horrible oppression, and here we thought we were doing them a good turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We were saving them from the horrible atrocities within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And it took us quite awhile to get that over, but finally ...finally they realized that the Americans were there to help them the very best they could possibly could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">QUESTION:  You said when you originally went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> you did an inspection. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Did you find any <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> supplies? </span><span class="sentence" id="191">What kind of food supplies did you find?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  Nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="193">We didn't find anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We found no supplies of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">No food. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Fortunately, they were able to lead us to the potato, or the Kartoffel storage and that's the first food that we had served...was weak potato soup, the same as they've been getting, but we didn't have anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">No medical supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">No clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Not a darn thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So here we are, combat troops faced with a situation like that and it was very difficult for us I can assure you. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was a very famous Czech surgeon. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">His name was Dr. Poloho. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">The Czechs told me that he was one of the most prominent and emminent surgeons in all of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">A fine gentleman. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And they told me a story about Dr. Poloho. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">He was called into the camp commandant's office. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">He was working practically as an intern. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">The commandant of the camp said, "I have a lieutenant who 1s seriously ill, and I would like to have you operate. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And Poloho told him, he said...well, he said, "Gee, I haven't done anything like that in a long time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And he said, "I'd need some time to prepare myself for this operation.” </span><span class="sentence" id="212">This lieutenant had something wrong with his stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Zierice who was the commandant of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> told him: "Well, you have 15 minutes to prepare yourself.” </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He said, "Now, if this lieutenant lives, I will put you in the <span class="BUILDING">base hospital</span> which 1s strictly for military personnel and you will be in charge of that, but if he dies, so do you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And so Poloho operated and he was successful and the lieutenant lived and Poloho was then transferred to the <span class="BUILDING">base hospital</span> which was a permanent <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in the main compound. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">He's a fine gentleman. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I remember him well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  Do you remember the conditions of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and approximately how many people were living in them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  Well, the main compound....the only brick were permanent <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were those of the structure for the base personnel or the camp personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">That's the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">For their <span class="BUILDING">administrative buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">The <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> , of course, the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Those were all permanent <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">The rest of the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were all wooden and that housed the prisoners of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Down in the...below the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was a placed called the Sanitaets Lager. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Sanitation, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="227"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sanitation camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And that was terrible, just awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And so lot of people who had been in there, 01:30: we moved up into the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and particularly when the hospital units came in, transferred them out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Then we burned the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> down because they were just ridden with disease and vermin and insects, everything you can imagine, so we burned them down to get rid of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Because we didn't want to subject our people and the rest of the prisoners in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to any unnecessary disease, plus the fact that we brought in, known in military terms as, a delousing unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Everybody in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was deloused. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Sprayed with DDT powder to kill any bugs that they might have on them and to prevent any further disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">The diseases were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> down below. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">You can name anything that you want to, and they had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">It was a terrible, terrible situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">The main disease, the main cause of death was typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I had no idea that typhus was as deadly as 1t was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> and I know that our surgeon that went with me....I took...I don't know....4, 5 doctors with me and our chief surgeon, he got ahold of me and he said, "You're going to get a typhus shot.” </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And gee he gave me a shot (laughing) about killed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But he said, "I don't want you to get sick.” </span><span class="sentence" id="241">So typhus was probably the No. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">| killer of disease in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Of course, there was typhoid and...and everything else you can think of. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Tuberculosis. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">It was terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  You mentioned that there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> ; there was a <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , and there was <span class="BUILDING">administration buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Was there any other <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  Those were the only permanent <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">The <span class="BUILDING">camp headquarters</span> ...I'm trying to recall in my mind now, as you went down the main <span class="DLF">street</span> on the righthand side, there was a <span class="BUILDING">brick building</span> and beneath that <span class="BUILDING">brick building</span> was the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">The <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> and believe it or not, a <span class="INT_SPACE">refrigerated room</span> , and I said, "What in the world they have a <span class="INT_SPACE">refrigerated room</span> here for?" </span><span class="sentence" id="251">They said, "Well, they would gas approximately 125 at a time in the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span> , and of course they were all dead in 15 or 20 minutes and they brought them out and the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> couldn't handle them that fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So they had a <span class="INT_SPACE">refrigerated room</span> where they put the bodies so that they wouldn't spoil.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  Did you inspect the <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Yes, indeed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  And what did you find?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  Well, the <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> was ...they call it a <span class="DLF">marble pit</span> (chuckle) really. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">It was a series of steps that led from the main compound down into the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> where the people would dig rocks and then carry them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And they put them on their back in what they call a rucksack. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">It's like the children carry their books in today. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">They dig these rocks, then they'd take them up the <span class="DLF">steps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And if they faltered up, going up, they were immediately executed and if not, they were thrown over the edge of the <span class="DLF">cliff</span> and smashed on the bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Now, those steps are called 186 steps of death and all of the people who died on those <span class="DLF">steps</span> , they said that the <span class="DLF">steps</span> ran absolutely red with blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And speaking of the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> ...of course, I must clarify this. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The things I'm relating to you I did not see, but this is all official testimony. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">It's not something that I have imagined or made up in my own mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">At one time there were 3500 Jews transferred from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> and when they arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , they shoved them all over the edge of the <span class="DLF">cliff</span> down in the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> and their bodies were all smashed down in the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Now that is official testimony and it is the record of the United States 3rd Army War Crimes Commission. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Any of the scenes that I am relating to you was all given to the 3rd Army Commission who was up there and made a complete inspection of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> questioned all of the...not all of them, but a lot of the prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So that is a part of their testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  Did you talk to any of these people there who worked in the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">There was ...well, in fact my interpreter Primisol Dobius was down in the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> and one day they came in and some of the SS people came down and said they wanted volunteers...volunteers to go out and work on the <span class="DLF">hog farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Anybody who knew anything about hogs, please step forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Dobius. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Now this, Dobius told me this. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">He volunteered to go and work on this <span class="DLF">hog farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">He didn't know a hog from a horse actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">He's a Jeweler. (</span><span class="sentence" id="280">laughing) He volunteered and they wouldn't take him. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">In fact, he showed me his leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">He's got a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in his leg where one of the SS guards kicked him and badly injured his leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">They didn't take him. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And he was so disappointed because he thought, "That's a way to get out of here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So they took 10 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">They left the <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> and went toward this <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And they got <span class="NPIP">outside</span> a distance and the machine guns on the <span class="BUILDING">tower</span> opened up and 01:37: killed all 10 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">He says, "Now, I'm glad I didn't go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="289">But the <span class="DLF">stone quarry</span> was really a hard labor place. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">The stones were used in <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and...and transported out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Oh, incidently, outside of...between the...the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> was a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And that was a special <span class="INT_SPACE">execution chamber</span> for Seereiss(?), </span><span class="sentence" id="293">the commandant of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and Eichgruber, who is a Gauleiter of <span class="REGION">upper Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">When they had somebody that they wanted to hang or kill, they had it in their own private execution room. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">The guard...the fellow who is a Pole, who ran the <span class="INT_SPACE">refrigerated room</span> as well as putting the bodies in the <span class="BUILDING">crematories</span> , gave me a ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">It was an army ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And he said it was from a lieutenant that had been executed by Seereiss and Eichgruber, and wanted to know if I would accept it and return it to...well, there was no identification, but I did take the ring and I turned it over to proper elements of the 3rd army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  Were you able to tell any difference between how the Jewish population and the non-Jewish population was treated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  (Sigh) Prior to our being there, I would say that the Jewish element in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> they were brutalized far worse than the rest of the population. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">That would be my humble opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  Did you have any forewarning that you were coming upon the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  None. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">None at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">We had no idea that there was on there, or what a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> truly what it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  What reaction did you have to seeing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> for the first time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  Unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">It's hard for me or any of my people who were with me to express how they felt to see man's inhumanity to man if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Unbelievable! </span><span class="sentence" id="309">As I mentioned before, I'd seen dead people, but never anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">It's absolutely and totally unbelievable that people could treat people like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And I guess a lot of it's still going on today. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I don't know why or how people can be so brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">After all, we're all God's children and to treat one another the way they treated people and supposedly 6 million Jews and supposedly another 6 million non-Jews for a total of 12 million. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">That's a lot of people! </span><span class="sentence" id="315">That's a lot of people! </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And they were (sigh) I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">That...today I still do not...even after all this length of time...anybody mentions SS to me, I have absolutely no regard, respect or anything for anyone who is an SSer because you didn't have to be an SSer. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">That's a volunteer outfit. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And they...they had strong backs and weak minds in my humble opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I have no love...I've been involved in a few things. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">In fact one time I got a call from the <span class="BUILDING">Simon Wiesenthal Center</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> wanting to know if I would, by telephone now, agree to speak to reporters from the Sun Times in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">They had called the <span class="BUILDING">Simon Wiesenthal Center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">They called me. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I told them that I would be happy to talk to them, so they called the Sun Times back and then they called me. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">They had found a person in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> who had been a former guard at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> and they picked my brains, of course, over the telephone, but asked me what my feelings were and, of course, they published in the paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">But I absolutely have no sympathy whatsoever for any SSer. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">The German Weirmacht altogether different. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">That's a German GI. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">He was a soldier doing a job just like any American soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Not brutal, like the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I probably should mention this that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> we needed help and lots of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So we found out that there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German POW camp</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So we sent back and asked for specialists. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Electricians, plumbers, sanitation people, mechanics and all that sort of thing to send up to help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We got about 400, brought them up, and we housed them, took care of them; classed them as German prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Had a captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I'll never forget his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Captain von Brum we started to utilize these people, and the first time that they showed they were attacked by the prisoners and therefore again we had to take some very positive action and explain to these people that they were there to help us to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">That they didn't know any more about a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> than we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">So that calmed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">But those German Wehrmacht...I told this Captain, I said, "Any of those people who do not behave themselves as soldiers, get rid of them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And he sent back...I don't know, 50, 60 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">The rest of them all did a fine job, and they were dumbfounded actually at what they saw in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">That was an experience with the German Wehrmacht.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">QUESTION:  Do you know why the 50 or 60 were sent back? </span><span class="sentence" id="347">What they had done?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">ANSWER:  They were...I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">But they were not up to the Captain's wishes and desires, so he got rid of them, sent them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">What they did I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION:  Did you talk with the Captain as to what he knew about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="352">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">They were surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">And I believe them. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">They were surprised as we were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  What was there reaction to seeing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Same as ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Now that's a German regular army soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And they didn't understand it all why such a thing existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">They'd heard of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">But not to the extent that they saw it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  Now...

<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  How long were you at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  35 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I spent in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> right there for a solitary 5 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">I was not exactly a prisoner in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but I was there and I knew exactly what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And relative to food, when we Started out they have huge steam vats over in this one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and the soup that they were serving was thin, watered soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Well, my doctors told me, said, "Now look. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">These people have been on a severe diet, and you cannot feed them very much to start off with.” </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So, as I mentioned, we found the potato storage, so we started out making very thin potato soup, same as they'd had previously. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">The most precious item in their diet was bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">You could get your throat cut for a piece of bread so big. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">They guarded a little bit of bread with their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">We found an old <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> and we got some prisoners who had been bakers before and (laughing) you won't believe this, but you know all the Hullaballoo these days about oat bread and oats and all that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Well, I think we originated that. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Because we didn't have any wheat 01:47: and we didn't have yeast. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">But we started making bread out of oats. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And we baked thousands and thousands of loaves, but, of course, when it first came out of the <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> or off and out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> , was just a mass of dough, not having any yeast or any curing agents of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So we put it in a big <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and let it age until 1t dried out. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">As soon as that happened we started giving each prisoner a slice of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Oh, my. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">The most precious thing they could have had. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Well, we kept building up our bread supply, so finally we got to the point where we gave them two slices. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And then a quarter of a loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And then a half a loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And (laughing) they...they came in and said, "We don't want any more bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">We got enough.” (</span><span class="sentence" id="390">laughing) We got a tremendous charge out of that, but then we found in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> of dehydrated vegetables which we started adding to the potato soup which enhanced it a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Then the doctor said, "Well, they're coming along pretty good.” </span><span class="sentence" id="392">So we started butchering horses, and we feed them horse meat, bread, dehydrated vegetables. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Not soup, but dehydrated vegetables, and potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And my oh my, what a change in their diets. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And fortunately, none of them got sick, but yours truly, I sampled every meal of food that was served in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to make sure that what they were getting was good because I had supervisors 1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , but the prisoners in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> were doing the cooking. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">But my mess people, they were supervising so I wanted to make sure that what they were getting was good so I had a sample of every bit of food that was served in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">QUESTION:  Where did the horses come from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">ANSWER:  The <span class="REGION">countryside</span> where...in fact, there were a lot of German army horses that had been driven ahead of the combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And I was surprised to learn that the Germans used hundreds or thousands of horses in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> for transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">The first time that we found that out was when we were going toward the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine River</span> and all of these horses, just hundreds and hundreds of them had come up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and, of course, the Germans took off and went across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and here's all these horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">That was long before we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , but that's where a lot of the horses came from, and plus any that we decided that we needed to take care of our people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  Did any of the surrounding civilian population help?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">ANSWER:  They didn't help a nickel's worth except when we started burying all the bodies that we found, we went to the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and around and got their services to handle these bodies and bury them. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And oh my or my, did that create 01:51: a terrible outcry among the people and I know there was a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">One of them was a dentist. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And my chaplain was my chief burial officer, and this dentist was giving him a bad time. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">He said he wasn't going to do anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Now, Dave Kinsler was the Chaplain (Laughing). </span><span class="sentence" id="409">He hauled off and hit him. (</span><span class="sentence" id="410">Laughing) When Dave told me about, I said, "That's all right.” </span><span class="sentence" id="411">But some of the people objected because it was a lousy job. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Really and truly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  You said you were there for 35 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">What caused you to move on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  We were transferred out from that particular <span class="NPIP">part</span> and I can't think of the name of the infantry division that came in and took over after we left, but we were moved down into the Austrian Alps to be on so-called combat occupation because the Werewolves were supposed to be starting up again down in the valley where we were going and we were to combat them if necessary, but it never happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">QUESTION:  The new unit that came in, did they administer the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">I lost all contact with it after...after we left I knew nothing of what went on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="419">QUESTION:  Any final comment you'd like to make?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="420">ANSWER:  No, except that I'm terribly sorry that it happened and I don't know how you can stop it really and truly. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">They're having miserable problems in the <span class="REGION">Middle East</span> now and I'm a little worried as to what might happen there. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">The treatment of the Jew, I don't understand it to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Just because a person was a Jew, why they were segregated. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">While we were there, there was a special ambassador by the name of Edward Pauling who was sent by President not Roosevelt, Truman to contact and make a survey, if you will, of the Jewish population and the elements around, and it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in particular. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I have a letter from him at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> thanking me for what...all the information and everything that went on while he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">He spent a whole day interviewing the Jews in the camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And he told me that in all of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the best they could estimate, there were only 25,000 Jews left in the whole <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">That's that's extermination wholesale really. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">To this day, there are a lot of people that do not understand what the Holocaust was. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">A lot of them don't want to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">It's not very pleasant history. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">School children. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">My goodness gracious, I have spoken to hundreds and hundreds of school children about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Showed them pictures and everything else, and it's kind of hard for those children to believe that actually and truly happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">But somehow or other, the children of this world and the young people of this world have to be apprised of what happened so that it never happens again. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">It can't happen again because 01:55 it...it more like...I just can't describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I...I truly can't because until you have been involved with a thing like the Holocaust it's very difficult to explain it to people and have them understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Another thing that happened at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> with the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">They brought about 700 of them in and said that they were all dirty and they needed a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So they took them in a big <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span> and they all had nice, warm showers and they brought them all out into the compound, the main compound. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Nude and squirted them with a fire hose 1n very, very cold weather until they all died. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And if they didn't die from exposure and shock the first time, they took them back in and give them more showers and brought them back out until they were all dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Now, again, I didn't see that, but that is official testimony and I'm sure that if you're to check with any former prisoner of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> they could verify what I have said. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">A gentleman from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ...he is a Czech by the name of Boshak, who 1s a prisoner in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a Czech, a very intelligent man, came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Defiance</span> to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">He'd been a prisoner there. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">He was a Czech and I think he was an attorney and he had married a lady and they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">But I had an interview with President Benes of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , a wonderful discussion with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And he was talking about Hitler and all the rest of the things and they used <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> ...they had sent a lot of radio and press people, magazine people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> to write about it and question everybody and they used <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> as a horrible example of Nazi atrocities. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">He was rather flowing and enjoying 1n his admiration for the American people. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And this I gotta say. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Do you know that there wasn't one solitary person, except two French nurses, that came into the camp that ever lent a hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Not one other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> 1n this world never helped at all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> with any assistance of any kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">That's kind of hard to believe. (</span><span class="sentence" id="455">laughing) These two French nurses came in one night about 2 O'clock. (</span><span class="sentence" id="456">Laughing) I couldn't speak French and I had a heck of a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Finally, some...found somebody that could interpret, and they were there to help with the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and the sick people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="459">ANSWER:  I don't have anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">I trust I haven't bored anybody with what I'm speaking of, but it's a long time ago and people have asked me, "How can you remember all of these things so vividly?" </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I said, "Well, 1t only happens to you once in your life time, and you can't forget a thing like that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="462">People said has it affected you mentally or otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I said, "No, I just...just one of those memories that you let go by."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">QUESTION:  Appreciate the interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">You did not bore anyone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">ANSWER:  Well, it's my pleasure to be here and anything that I can do to further the movement of the teaching of the Holocaust, I'm happy to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I didn't mention this previously, but I was on the State of Ohio Holocaust Commission where we met once a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I was there but it was primarily, I think, for educators, because they were working up a curriculum for the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in the State of Ohio, and it was adopted and we all put a hand to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">It will now become a part of the educational system in the State of Ohio, the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Which is good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="471">QUESTION:  Thank you again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  You're most welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">My pleasure to be here. </span>
