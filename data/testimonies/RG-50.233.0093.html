<p><span class="sentence" id="849">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">One day in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , someone told me that they saw my older brother Burachal??, </span><span class="sentence" id="851">he was twelve years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">He’s alive (they said). </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I went looking in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> every day to see him. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="855">The whole time, I saved up four portions of bread to give him and I never saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">So I don’t know if they said the truth or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And another thing I have to say -- when we went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> , I had this very good friend of mine from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> -- Rochela. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And they chose us naked to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">So she was very skinny and she was right behind me and I went forward -- they let -- they pointed me to go forward, I went forward and I am there and I am looking for my friend Rochela and she is not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I give a look to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and she is over there -- purple and blue and that is the last that I saw of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">You see, you had to be perfect to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">You couldn’t have a pimple on your body and here they gave you for six months not to get your period and we broke out in all kinds of boils and as a matter of fact, ,I did have a boil on my belly but the SS men didn’t see me, he must have been distracted so he didn’t see the boil, he just pointed me to go ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">But we all had something from that -- it wasn’t normal and that is the last I saw Rochela. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">So they chose you naked -- you couldn’t be too skinny, you couldn’t be too fat. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">You couldn’t have a boil, you couldn’t ...... can you imagine?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="866">QUESTION:  You couldn’t be sick?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="870">QUESTION:  Very few.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">ANSWER:  I mean just to think of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">If you had a child you went right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">If you were old, you went right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">So there was only a certain few that were old enough -- if you were young. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I mean the youngest people that could live is two years younger than Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">There is three girls from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and then there’s me. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Because I was sixteen. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">So you had to be a certain age and a certain weight and a certain shape -- too fat and they wouldn’t -- you went right away if you were too fat. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">And then finally when you made it and after six months in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> you had to be -- you couldn’t be too skinny, you couldn’t have any pimples on you -- you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="880">It’s unbelievable.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="883">QUESTION:  And you didn’t come down with any diseases? </span><span class="sentence" id="884">You didn’t mention typhus, for example.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="885">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">I never was sick a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I was husky and I had a very, very nourishing upbringing. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Everything was very natural and very healthy and that is how we should eat today. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">All that good, healthy natural food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">QUESTION:  I will say yes to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="891">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">So I had good stock -- as my son-in-law says “peasant stock.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="893">QUESTION:  Peasant stock -- good genes -- good upbringing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="894">ANSWER:  So all those little things that I guess God was with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">I put myself 1n God’s hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">As I told you a while ago -- I made up my mind, I am not going to run to and I am not going to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Where God will put me, that is where I am going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And that is what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">I didn’t run to and I didn’t run from. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Like they used to say, they’re picking from this <span class="DLF">block</span> or that <span class="DLF">block</span> and they ran to that <span class="DLF">block</span> to be picked or ran away from our <span class="DLF">block</span> so that they shouldn’t be picked. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">I let God’s hands and then I never believed ... Oh -- this you must hear too. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , I have -- I happened to have a mechanical mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">So they put me to work -- to do a man’s machine -- work a man’s machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">So because I understand machinery.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="906">ANSWER:  Right, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">So, some of the girls -- now here, I worked between all the men -- and some of the girls used to flirt with the men --they used to meet them in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> and flirt with them and I wouldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I said like this -- if I’m going to burn- there will be less of me to burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">If they give you a slice of bread, an apple -- I don’t need that. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">If I’m going to burn, there will be less of me to burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">If I am going to survive then I have a conscience I want to live with my conscience -- that is not to sell my soul for a piece of bread or for a piece of apple. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And I didn’t get anything from them, but I did the delivery -- the food, the mail back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">That is another thing -- I am very proud of myself that I was young and yet I had my principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">QUESTION:  You had your honor and your dignity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="915">ANSWER:  My honor and my dignity. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">First I didn’t believe that they’re going to let me survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">Would you believe they’re going to let you survive and tell the world what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="918">I never believed. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">The only thing I hoped was for the bombs to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">So then I said, if they put me in the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , I will burn quicker if there is less fat on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">So that is my morals.</span></p>
