<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  Oh my.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  He was interned for 11 months, because the British were very nervous about people who spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And of course, we spoke German then. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So he was interned there. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Also, my mother had a sister who had married a German, who tried to follow — who did follow her to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And then he was sent on a transport to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and it was torpedoed, and he went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And that was — she never remarried or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">My father was there for 11 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">He had a great time. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He became a cook, which he never did before or since. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And in — it wasn’t —

QUESTION:  Do you remember not having him around?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">My mother was only able to work as a domestic. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">That was the only job that was available for the immigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And I remember we went to — she worked in what was called a — a <span class="BUILDING">boys’ college</span> , it was like <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , with kids living there. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And I got the measles. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And so they shipped me off to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> very fast, before I spread it through the entire —
QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  — <span class="BUILDING">school</span> population. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And that was my — just my mother and I were there at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And then my — the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that I went to in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and I don’t really have a clear picture of that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , decided to evacuate everybody out to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So they sent us out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gloucestershire</span> , and we lived in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> — a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cheltenham</span> , and we were boarded with a family there. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And I —I have very clear pictures of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there, they had a — a regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And I — I do remember one day the principal I guess it was, called me into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and said, you — you understand German? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I said, well, I don’t speak it much any more, because by then you — you didn’t speak German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  That was going to be — that was going to be one of my questions, 1s how was that transition for — for a young child? </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They — they soak up languages like sponges.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  So, I could imagine —
ANSWER:  I was teaching my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">My parents had been taking English lessons, you know, with — with records and stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And they — they died with an accent, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I picked it up immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And the principal said to me, you speak German? </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I — well, I understand German, cause I didn’t want to speak it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And apparently, there was a prisoner of war camp nearby, and they wanted to bring these prisoners over to talk to me, the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And I —
QUESTION:  And you were how old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  — refused to talk to —
QUESTION:  You must have been a little girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  I must have been about eight or nine at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And I said no, I won’t talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And I wouldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">I would not talk — I wouldn't meet with them, I wouldn’t talk to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  So tell me though, as an eight or nine year old child, to have such — such a very strong, marked position, how had things been explained to you by your parents, of what was going on, and why you’d left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and — and this war, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Ti — can you recall that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I don’t remember ever actually discussing it with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">It was just sort of a fact of life that you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">You didn’t — you — you couldn’t stay there any more, because there were these guys marching around with the brown uniforms, and the boots, and — and these were not good guys, and the sooner we got out of there, the better. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So, off we went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and I became an English child fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I —I was — as I said, I was teaching my parents English because I — I picked it up, you know, very quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  So, in other words, was it an English child saying to the principal that no, I don’t want to talk to the German prisoners of war, because they’re the enemy of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and we’ve just survived the blitz, or was it a —
ANSWER:  No, I just said I don’t want to talk to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  And that’s it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  And that was the end of it, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I never met them, and I — I wouldn’t speak with them, so I— I don’t know why they wanted to talk to me in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  I also find it very surprising that a principal would ask an eight year old child to meet with prisoners of war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  I find it —
ANSWER:  It was — I don’t know, maybe — I don’t know, maybe they were being rehabilitated or something, I don’t know, I really don’t know, but it was kind of a strange episode.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  But other than that, did you wa — did you feel comfortable in — in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">ANSWER:  Yes, except we always felt a little bit like the outsiders. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We were the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">At that time, <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> was not very cosmopolitan, especially out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> was a little different, but out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They didn’t know what Jews were. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We sort of had to explain, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">There was a woman who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , once or twice — I think once a week or twice a week, I don’t remember exactly, to teach me Hebrew, which I still can’t read. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And once in awhile, after things were not quite as bad, we — we had some relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , so we would go to visit them in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Meanwhile, my aunt, the aunt, my mother’s sister, the one who married the German, she had also been interned in the Isle of Man. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And she was released, and she stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> for — until after the war, and eventually came to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> But we would go and visit her too, but this was, you know, not while the blitz was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">That — that was pretty bad.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  Do you remember war — wartime sorts of episodes or experiences while in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , or was it blitz, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cheltenham</span> and — and this, you know, inter — non- interaction with — with the — the POWs, you know, that you were asked to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  Were there more such things that — that — that are in your mind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Well, I remember listening to Churchill on the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I mean, everybody listened to Churchill on the radio, and he made things, you know, he was very positive, and — and upbeat and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I remember the sound of the — the bombs, you know, the — those things that — that made this noise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  The V2 rockets?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Yeah, and then they stopped, and then you knew they were gonna fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And then when we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> and — at night, we would come out in the morning and there would be rubble all over, because you know, the bomb had dropped not far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">But the — the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> was very safe, and everybody went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I loved it, because I — I have no siblings, and when we went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> , you know, we’d go with our pillows and our blankets and everything, and there’d be kids to play with. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">On the <span class="DLF">platform</span> , you know, we — we’d run around and have a great time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  What — what kids do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  What kids do, and thank goodness they do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">It was a very, you know, su-supposedly normal childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But —
QUESTION:  Do you remember V-E day? </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Do you remember th-the day that war was over, or not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  I remember I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and the teacher said, do you know what day this is? </span><span class="sentence" id="183">It was V day — V-D day, V — the day that they landed at the —

<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  And she said, remember this day, because it’s very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">There — the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we lived, it wa — there was a — a group of — th-there was a — an American base not far, and so the soldiers used to come in, and I had a — a friend who had an older sister who, you know, they used to go out with the G.I.s and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And we used to follow the G.I.s, and we’d say to them, got any gum, chum? </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And they would give us gum. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And we thought that was —
QUESTION:  The coolest thing, huh?</span></p>
