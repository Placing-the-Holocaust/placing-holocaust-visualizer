<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  ... name, date of birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Margaret Lambert. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born, a name that I hate, Gretl, it’s too Teutonic. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I hate that name and Gretl Bergman and I was born April 12, 1914 ina very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and it was a great life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And what was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laupheim</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about that great life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  Well we had all the freedom that we needed, could roam around every <span class="NPIP">place</span> , once I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> at the age of 7, I could go into the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> and hunt for frogs and snakes and stuff like this and lots of friends, mostly non Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We, there was a large Jewish community in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> but due to my love for sports, most of my friends were non Jewish and that was never, never, never a problem until a certain time of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  Tell me about your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  My father had a terrific sense of humor and I think I inherited it from him and he had a large <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> making hair goods, hair nets, wigs, one of the, some of them found their way even into the metropolitan opera and my mother was, I don’t know she was a little bit of a, a kvetch if you know what that means. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">She was always trying to get our attention by saying oh I have this terrible headache and so on and so, and I don’t think she was a, she was not a very warm person because both I and my, my two brothers we felt she was inapproachable but we had a good, good time together. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I had a brother who was two years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Then I gota little baby brother when I, he was 12 years younger which embarrassed the heck out of me because I didn’t think parents should engage in this sort of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And but we were all very good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My brother died unfortunately very suddenly about 20 years ago on a pleasure trip and my younger brother I’m in touch with and we have a good, very good relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your religious background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  There was no organized religion in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We ate everything, we did everything, we never went to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> except on the high holidays and I hated it because I had to wear a hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And my father, he used to say to us, be a decent 1 2 human being, that should be your religion and I think we, he followed that and we followed it too. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And religion never meant anything to me and especially after all the things that happened later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">If I ever had any religious feelings I think I would have lost it pretty fast after all the things that happened to the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Q; ...did you identify with being a Jew as a girl?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Well only in the fact that I was Jewish and I had to go to <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> twice a year but it, it didn’t, it didn’t make any difference because nobody cared. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I was the only girl in my class and I was the only Jew in my class and there was never, never an unpleasant and you didn’t think of yourself as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">You thought of yourself as a German I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  So you never experienced anti — Semitic feelings before Hitler arrived on the scene?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  No, I only once I said some neighbor boy called me a dirty Jew and I beat him up and I was never bothered again so that was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  So the events of 1933 and onward must have come as a shock to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  It most certainly did. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">It was, it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I mean from one day to other, to the other there was like a <span class="DLF">wall</span> you know one day you were a respected citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">The next day you were a, a tenth rate citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">You were banned from all <span class="BUILDING">public places</span> , no <span class="BUILDING">theatres</span> , no <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> , no <span class="DLF">swimming pools</span> , you couldn’t go any <span class="NPIP">place</span> and you could not associate with non- Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  ... your athletic life before 1933.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  When I was about 6 years old there was this little club in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and you could go as often as you wanted in the afternoon or in the evening whoever was ready there, the older people helped the younger people how to do certain things and it was great, you just went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I could go there un, unescorted because it was close to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I spent some time there and I was happy as a lark.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  What did you do there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Well we did gymnastics, we did running, we did whatever, whatever you know there was a lot of gymnastics involved and they worked on the parallel bars which I hated. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I hated that stuff because I wasn’t good at it because my legs were too long I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And but they instructed us the older people, and there was a terrific relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">They would take us out Sundays to go swimming and it was really very nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  What did you like about sports? </span><span class="sentence" id="43">2 3
ANSWER:  I just loved it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  You just loved what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  I loved everything that had to do with physical activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I loved to climb. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I loved to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I, I just loved, loved to be <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> , it, it was, I skied, I skated, I swam. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Nobody ever told me anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I played tennis, I played ping-pong. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Nobody ever told me anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">It was just, I was a natural athlete and whatever I started to do, I did well without being instructed in anything so, it was the, I liked it better than mathematics let me tell you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  And you were good at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  And I was good at it, without working very hard at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Did sports start playing a very significant role in your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Well once I got to be in the age where I got to be noticing boys it became a very important thing in my life because that was the social life then, you know you went to the <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> and uh the boy you had your eye on walked you <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and that was a big deal and that was very good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Was sports important in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Yes, I think there was hardly the smallest little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> that didn’t have some kind of sports going. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">If it was just a soccer club, club. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">You know they play soccer and, and team sports more but there were very few <span class="NPIP">places</span> where there was nothing going on and that was a very important thing and once I got a little older, maybe 14 or so, we used to go to other little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and compete there and that was really like a lot of fun and you met a lot of new people and, and it was, it was great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Were there a lot of <span class="BUILDING">sporting clubs</span> and...
QUESTION:  Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Has nothing to do with the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I think that’s why I hated <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so much because whenever I came into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> on Monday the teachers would make fun of me and say oh you must have had a tough weekend again. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Maybe you were playing field hand ball or something and why don’t you pay more attention to your, your lessons and I think that turned me off more than anything else and I turned more to sports then instead of less, the way I thought I would. (</span><span class="sentence" id="65">Technical interruption)
QUESTION:  ...a future in athletics, in terms of Olympic competition. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">3 4
ANSWER:  I don’t believe so at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">That came much later really. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">But when I was quite small, maybe 10, 12 years old, I had made up my mind, I will be a physical education teacher or a coach. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And I knew exactly where to go in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and study there and it didn’t work out that way because by the time I was ready for it, I wasn’t accepted anymore but uh I always wanted to be in sports.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Not necessarily competitively but...
ANSWER:  No, just teaching and coaching and you know later on once I got too old to do it myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  So you weren’t thinking about competitions and Olympics...
ANSWER:  Well, I, I don’t think that I really thought about the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I don’t even think I knew much about the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">You know we lived in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hick town</span> that did have a newspaper but I think it was more important to see that the chickens laid the eggs or whatever than you know all they would report the sports results of what happened in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But nothing really you didn’t, you didn’t get much information. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">There wasn’t any television of course and the radio came much later so I don’t think that I knew much about the Olympics until I got a lot later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  ...and the radio came later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  There was no, was no television, of course, no television whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And radio also came you know it wasn’t there when I was very small.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  There was nothing different at that stage about being a Jewish athlete?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  None whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I’ve said this so many times that there was absolutely no difference between the Jewish people and the gentile people. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">There were not that many Jewish people doing sports, let’s face it and especially not girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">But I never, never felt any, any different. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I mean we would go Sundays go to a nice <span class="DLF">swimming hole</span> and go swimming and very often was the only Jewish person going so there was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I felt perfectly comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Were your parents or your brothers athletic also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">No, nobody, nobody I don’t know where I got it from, I really don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But my brothers liked to watch it but they, they didn’t do much by themselves, I mean my brother, my oldest brother skied a little bit but nothing very, not like I. I mean I was possessed I think by sports.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  You started to talk about when things began changing for you as a young athlete and I’d like you to talk about that a little bit more... 4 5
ANSWER:  In the spring of 1933, it was just around my birthday and it was not a very nice birthday present, I got a letter from my sports club, you are no longer welcome here because you’re Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Heil Hitler and that was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So they just threw me out of the club and that was the end of my sports career as far as that was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">There was no Jewish sports per se in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> because everything was always mixed up you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">There was everybody did things together. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">But we, we were just locked out of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">All the Jews were thrown out of the <span class="BUILDING">sports club</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">All the Jews, you couldn’t go to, to a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I mean Jews were excluded from all German life. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">That started in 1933 and it was a horrible time. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">There was one <span class="BUILDING">Jewish restaurant</span> in, in, in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and everybody congregated there and everybody commiserated you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">What are we going to do, what’s going to happen here. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And it was a horrible life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  Was any of this anticipated, did you know much about Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  I don’t think it was anticipated in the realm the way it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Um once he started, you know became chancellor...
QUESTION:  ...say once Hitler...
ANSWER:  Once Hitler became chancellor you started to worry a little bit you know but everybody thought this is, this is going to blow over, he’s not going to last. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">As a matter of fact, I had been accepted at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> for physical education in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">For the spring semester and I wrote them a letter saying that I was Jewish and would it be advisable for me to come just then. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And they wrote me a letter back literally saying wait until this thing blows over so everybody thought this is not going to last. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But once Hitler had you know taken hold you were just afraid for your life if you, if you disobeyed or whether it was a Jew or whether it was a gentile, you did exactly as you were told, like in a real dictatorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  ...how your life changed...life for a teenaged girl...
ANSWER:  It was a terrible, terrible time. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It was, it was almost, you couldn’t understand, why did this happen, why aren’t those people associating with us any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I mean some of the friends stayed with us you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">But only in a. a very in a way they couldn’t be caught to come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They had to come in the middle of the night and sneak in the <span class="DLF">back door</span> if they wanted to visit with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But a lot of them did change that, you know they went the other way and they figured well maybe Hitler is out god from now on and we will stay with him but it was, it was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We didn’t know what to do with ourselves, you couldn’t go anywheres. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">You couldn’t go into a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , you couldn’t go into a movie and especially in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">In a large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> I guess you could bear to go to a movie every once in a while or a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> but not in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Everybody knew everybody else and, and you just didn’t do it and if you did it, ’'m sure, you would be punished according to Hitler’s credo, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">5 6
QUESTION:  Did you feel betrayed by friends...
ANSWER:  Yes, some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">There was a girl next door to me, we grew up together as babies. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">We were together every single day. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">She ate in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> more times than she ate in her own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and soon as Hitler came in she didn’t know me any more and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">She had the chance to sneak into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> just like anybody else, you know other friends did. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But she never made that attempt and maybe 2 years ago she wrote me a letter, the first trme I ever heard from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">My dear, darling you know stuff like this and I’m so happy to finally find your address and the good times we had together and stuff like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And I wrote her back. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I said yes it was a good time but you didn’t think so then because you didn’t know me any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">That was the end of that friendship. (</span><span class="sentence" id="130">technical adjustment)
QUESTION:  ...how life changed in *33, give me a picture of what that was like...
ANSWER:  It is absolutely impossible for anybody who hasn’t gone through this what it was like to be among friends one day and the next day you would pass that same friend in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and you wouldn’t even say hello to each other because you were not, some you were not allowed to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Or some were afraid to do it but you just passed your friends up, friend or walk right on. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And for instance, my younger brother is 12 years younger than I and he had all the kids from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> were his friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">They played together all non Jewish children and they all played together and all of a sudden after 1933 they started to beat him up and on his way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , he had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> because the other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> would not take him and on the way to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> they beat him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And I would walk him to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as often as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And they wouldn’t beat him up when I was there but they would call him and me all kinds of horrible names and they would spit at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And I wouldn’t dare to touch those children because if I had touched a non Jewish child I would have been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So we really vegetated, there was nothing to do except worrying that, what’s going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">My brother was working for a universal pictures and they had a, a <span class="BUILDING">studio</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Your older brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  My older brother and they closed up because they saw what was coming, and they closed up and he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because there was nothing for him to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So he started to work in, in my father’s <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">You know try to do make himself useful there because there was, he couldn’t find a job of course, nobody would employ you. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Gentile people were not allowed to, to but in <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">If somebody got caught doing that they would take their pictures and hang them up at the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I mean they really meant business. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">You know they were absolutely excluded from everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">6 7
QUESTION:  As a family did you talk about this, did you try to make sense of it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  I don’t remember that really. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I think we were just into ourselves more or less, you know everybody was worrying on their own but I don’t think 1t was discussed all that much until I finally decided that this was no life, you know so, in from the spring of 1933 then finally in the, in the fall, I said I have to get out of here, I can’t live like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And I, I decided to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> then and my parents agreed to it that I would go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> because it was a life of just vegetating. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And talking about the same thing over, what is going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Talking the same thing over and over again and not to come to any result. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I mean nobody would know, knew what, what was going to happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">QUESTION:  In this period then did you essentially have to give up your athletics?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Oh yes we did try to straighten out an old potato acre, that somebody had given us, one of our Jewish families there. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And we, we ran there and I started a field hand ball, which is the same as football except it’s like a combination of basketball and, and football. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And I coached them and it takes in 11 people I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I was the only girl on the team and I shot the only goal the first time we, we lost 7 to 1 and I shot the only goal. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But after a while everybody got tired of this, you know the same people every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It, it was horrible, that was they had an orchestra there, I mean there were many Jewish people who played the violin and, we, we played a little music but there really wasn’t anything to do, so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  And your father was able to remain in business?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  For a time being, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Because he did a lot of business with the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  Can you say my father...
ANSWER:  My father did a lot of business with <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and the Germans desperately the foreign currency to come in so they were already preparing for the war effort I suppose and that’s why the, they left him on for a while but then after several years, he was just like a figurehead on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And the Nazis took over and but he couldn’t leave because they took passport away so he was stuck until a certain time came when he was able to, to get out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  You said that you had decided that you wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , this was just you alone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about that please. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">7 8

QUESTION:  ...to backtrack...alternative outlets...
ANSWER:  We made our own alternative outlets. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">We tried of course I was being in the torn in the direction of sports, as I said before, we played music and we tried to entertain ourselves as well as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But sports for me of course was the, the thing I wanted the most. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So a farmer let us have an old <span class="DLF">potato field</span> and we tried to make it smooth, you know it’s very rough, you know big clumps on there and we tried to, to smooth it out and we started our own Jewish hand ball team on there, hand ball is a game like soccer except that you don’t kick the ball. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">You dribble it like a basketball and you pass it you know throwing it and it’s a great game. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And I coached all the fellows on the team and I was the only girl on the team and I shot the only goal in the first time when we lost 7 to 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And we also tried to straighten out, next to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> there was a, a <span class="DLF">yard</span> and we tried to straighten that out to do calisthenics on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Because the <span class="DLF">soccer field</span> was a, the <span class="DLF">handball field</span> was a little bit out of the way so we tried to straighten that out but we had to fight the teachers’ chickens and they used that same <span class="NPIP">place</span> for their activities and it was not very appetizing so we gave up on that pretty fast.

QUESTION:  Were there Jewish sporting clubs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  There were Jewish sporting clubs. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Maccabee they called it, but it was a Zionistic outfit and it was like the National League and the American League in baseball. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">They didn’t get along with, with the other Jewish athletes so they, they called them the RFJ was people who fought in the first world war, they, they were the veterans they started this club for athletics and they were able in some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> to rent or even buy I don’t know <span class="BUILDING">stadiums</span> where Jews could, could practice on but the facilities were pretty poor, pretty terrible but as I said we tried to do as much as we could to entertain ourselves and there was no, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coach</span> capable of, you know anybody who was a little bit more of advanced like I was to tell me what, how to do it and what to do and it was just a very, very bad time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="215">QUESTION:  Jewish clubs, were they already in operation or were they formed in reaction?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">ANSWER:  I think they were mostly formed after the, as I said the Maccabee, they were formed before already but the uh, veterans of foreign wars I think they called themselves, that, that came afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">You know in all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> almost especially in the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , they, they start a movement so Jews would have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go to and and, and do sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">9 10

<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I mean it was, it was very bad to, to really achieve something spectacular because it was just, it’s 1t was a poor condition and no coaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">That was, that was, that was bad too.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  ...don’t say as I said.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">The day I won the British Championship was a fabulous day for me because I felt such pride in myself that I was able to do that because the Germans had told me I’m inferior, I’m no good, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And all of a sudden here I am the British champion, champion. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And I was hoping that somehow word would go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> so they would find out that I did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And my father had come over to watch me, I thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I thought he, that was the reason for his trip, trip to watch me compete but on the way back from the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> , we found out differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">My, he didn’t tell me right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">He waited until we got back to his <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">But on the way back there, there were newspapers being hawked in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and everything seemed like to be big excitement. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">We asked the taxi driver what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And he said has something to do with the Nazis killing each other off. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So we stopped the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> and we got out, got the newspaper and it told the story about Hitler having killed off his best friend, plus about a thousand of his Nazi people because they, they complained about something and he wanted to show you. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">You just didn’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">You did as you were told and when we thought that this might have been the beginning of the end for Hitler we couldn’t have been more wrong because Hitler by killing off these people let everybody know if you want to stay alive, don’t be a hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So we got to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> (clears throat) excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And there my father finally told me that I had to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and the reason he could not write to me or tell me on the telephone was because there was this strict censorship of everything coming into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or going out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And he couldn’t have dared to tell me that unless I came back the family was being threatened you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Tell her to come back or else. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So of course I decided immediately to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , especially in view of what happened to Hitler’s pals. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">If he can kill of his own people, what is he going to, to 10 11 a Jew who says no. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And I went back, I think within a week I was back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which was very, very hard to accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I was supposed to be a member of the German Olympic team and that was something I couldn’t understand and didn’t understand for a very long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I think I didn’t understand it until I came over here and saw all the newspaper articles that had been written about my involvement with this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">The only reason I was supposed to be on that Olympic team was because the Americans, and the English and the French and a lot of the other <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> threatened not to come to the 1936 Olympics due to the discrimination of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And Hitler wanted to make this the best Olympics ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">He used it as a propaganda vehicle, and he wanted of course the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and all the big nations to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And this was the, the ruse that they used. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I was the pigeon to help him get the 1936 Olympics settled and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">They were already making, building and change, you know making a <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> and everything but they were really afraid that the, that 1t would not be a good Olympics for them because the big nations weren’t going to show up and that would take away from the, from the, from the games of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So that’s how I got on the German Olympic team and it was tough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  How did your father get this information that they wanted you to come back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  Well that was, it was very peculiar. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">My father told me at the time, the way he had to come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to tell me a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Somebody showed up at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laupheim</span> to tell him that he also could not write to my father that the family would be in, in danger if I didn’t come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So if this man traveled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laupheim</span> , told my father, my father traveled to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , told me and that was alike a relay race you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Avoiding danger.</span></p>

QUESTION:  So you came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ...training and preparation...
ANSWER:  When I got back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I was hoping I would at least have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I could train. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But the fact that I was a member of the German Olympic team did not allow me to use any of the <span class="BUILDING">stadiums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I was still a Jew and was not allowed to use any of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So I had to use the poor facilities of the Jewish clubs and compete there for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And that was, was absolutely terrible because first of all there was no competition whatsoever. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">If you don’t have any competition it’s, you have to only fight yourself and that’s much harder than somebody you know if there’s stiff competition you try to outdo each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But when there’s no competition it’s very hard so I always had to fight myself and it was really very, very tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And then of course all those stupid questions I have to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">You know everybody asked me are you going to be in the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">You know what are you going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I was a nervous wreck I think and day and night, things were on my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">It was really horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And my parents and I we didn’t discuss it because I knew they were worried about it and they knew I was worried about it so we didn’t talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Because we, we didn’t want to hurt each other’s feelings I suppose so it, it was very, very hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  How does one train for the Olympics if you’re not on the same <span class="DLF">playing field</span> ...
ANSWER:  I was ordered three times, four times in those two years to go to an Olympic training course and that’s the only solid training I had for the Olympics and as I said before, I think I said it before that I was a natural athlete and if I hadn’t been a, a natural athlete I don’t think I would have achieved what I did because there just wasn’t any, any opportunity for me, for me to, to get better or to advance or to know what I was doing, it just happened naturally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  ...1f there had been good Jewish athletes...they wouldn’t have had an opportunity to progress and be competitive with the German athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Is that true?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  There were very few Jewish athletes who really were capable to compete on a national level. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I mean there were, the best Jewish athletes let’s say, but they weren’t the best German athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And they really, really couldn’t compare, they were very, very few and there were some for instance in the Olympics, there was a fencer Helena Myer, she was half Jewish, they let her compete, I guess half Jewish was only half as offensive as being all Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And there were some half Jewish athletes that competed--one in, 1n ice hockey so he, he melted into the, you know into the team so he wouldn’t stick out like I would have stuck out. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">But I don’t think there were any Jewish athletes really that were capable of be, competing on, on a national level. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">13 14
QUESTION:  ...the backing to get better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">ANSWER:  No, the, the Germans did another number. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">They you know every time there were some newspaper articles written that they’re not holding up their end of our, that they finally signed a commitment that they would not discriminate against Jewish athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">They, they wrote it down and but there were all these newspaper articles that they were not living up to their commitment, that they wouldn’t let me compete in the German national championship. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And they said well she was not entitled to compete in that because she was not a member of the German track and field association. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And why wasn’t I member, because I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And so you know it was like a dog chasing it’s tail. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And so it, they had, they had all kinds of, of, of ways to talk themselves out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">They for instance, in 1935 for instance they got a little scared again so they called all the best Jewish athletes for a training course, an Olympic training course. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">I said 1n an article once, I think Snow White and the seven dwarfs would have done just as well as those athletes because they weren’t any good. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I happened to meet my husband there, that was the best part about this training course, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">But they really weren’t good enough but it was just a sham by, by the Germans to show well we, we’re trying to find new talent for the Olympics in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> but it, that was all baloney.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  Did you learn anything there...

<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  ...was there a qualifying process?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">ANSWER:  Well for instance the um German track and field championships, they were supposed to be one of the events that would show who was going to be taken into consideration for the Olympics but they wouldn’t let me compete because it’s, I was not a member of the German track and field association so I couldn’t compete, but they, they, they at one time I, I had to compete in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> which was the scariest thing because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> was the hot bed of, of Nazism. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">That was where Hitler lived there and I was scared stiff to go there and I didn’t do that well and it was noted, duly noted by the Nazis that I only jumped a, a meter 53 instead of better but I beat still, beat the competition by about 15 inches. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But I didn’t do as well because I think I was mentally a wreck at the time.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="378">ANSWER:  The gentile com, the gentile girls who were supposed to go into the Olympics they had their own meets which I was not, not admitted and I think the whole deal was just if I did fairly well they would not throw me out because they were still afraid that the boycott would happen so I think no matter what I did, I was pretty safe at that point, even the, you know in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> when I did not do too well, they couldn’t, they couldn’t afford to throw me out at that point because they were still afraid the Americans wouldn’t show up.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  When I came back from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> a couple of times during the month, because there the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish club</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> and they had invited me to come and use that <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> so I happened to learn about a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , a not a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> it was a <span class="BUILDING">gentile owned school</span> that for physical education, it was a <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> , not a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And I thought Ill, I'll apply and see if they take me, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">If they don’t take me fine too and they did take me because they might have got, they, they had to get permission from the government that they could accept a Jew and I suppose that it was all in view of my being an Olympic candidate and had they not let me go into that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it might have come out into the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and there might have been more, more problems for, for, for the Olympics for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So they accepted me and it, I had a good time there, we were all very friendly, the girls were all very friendly there and it was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I could go in the afternoon after they were finished practicing we would go into this <span class="BUILDING">café</span> and make pigs out of ourselves, eating whipped cream cake and everything and we had a terrific time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And we were very friendly and it was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">The only thing they would, they would prevent me, they, the curriculum had in it German gymnastics and they wouldn’t let me take part in the German gymnastics, now why I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Because the Jew and the German gymnastics that was too, too much of a paradox I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">But the other girls, we just laughed about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">We thought it was funny and by then I was so used to being excluded that it wasn’t such a big deal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">QUESTION:  You were going to the <span class="BUILDING">café</span> and hanging out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  Yes, it was good, it was good, it was, you know, the big time, in s big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> you could do more things, you could go to the movies and we did do a foolish thing one time with these, with these girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">There were some, we were having a lot of good times and laughing and carrying on and about six of us and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> full of SS uni, uniformed SS men at the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and they kept looking at us and looking at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Finally they came over and they tried to make dates with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And there’s this big German blond guy trying to make a date with me and I said no and I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And the more he tried to make a date with me the more the other girls laughed and we got hysterical. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And it was, it was funny and it was stupid at the same time cause had I been found out, I don’t know what would ha, what would have happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">But we were young and you didn’t really you know think of any consequences that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">16 17

<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER:  There must have been quite some protest again in the, in the <span class="COUNTRY">Unites States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I know that a Senator or Congressman Sellar that he was pleading in the congress not to send a team over. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">There were, there were protest meets in <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span> , 20,000 people showed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">There was a lot of resistance and this must have been the reason why they invited me to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> and, and that as in 19, 1936 to, to compete at a meet there and it was really rough. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">You know when you the only Jew you know people, if the spectators knew that I was Jewish they didn’t wish me well. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I knew that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And the, the officials were hostile. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I think I mentioned that before. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And it was very hard to, to compete against myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">So but I was so mad that I equaled the German record. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">The German record then was five foot three and I equaled that. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I must have cleared it by, by 15 inches at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I was so angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And usually you have three tries for each height you know you start at 4, 6 let’s say. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">You have, if you do it the first time, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But you have to go over it by the third try otherwise you’re eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Well all the other girls were out by if they did about 4, 8 and they were all out and I kept going and going on and going. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And every height I jumped over it on the first trme. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So I did the 5, 3 and I think the, the officials most likely would have liked to poison but they didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And I was just so elated. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I thought this is the first thing that ever happened to me, you know those lousy Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And after that I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I think and I wanted to share this with my family and I think this was the last time that I, I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> then and I said now this 1s 4 weeks before the Olympics start. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I better go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and see what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my parents were happy and my brothers were happy that I did this and I look for the mail everyday, what’s going to happen, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">What, what excuses are they going to use, that as only one, one other German girl who, who was capable of doing this right and how are they going to, if they don’t want me in there how are they going to get rid of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And I was really scared, aren’t they going to break my leg or what are they going to do to, to eliminate me. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">But it was very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">One day a letter came and it said in view of the fact that you have been doing very poorly lately we did not select you for the Olympic team. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Heil Hitler and that was the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And I said, I remember me sitting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the <span class="DLF">stoop</span> and I got this letter and I must have used every profanity I knew and I knew a lot of them and at the same time, I had such an incredible feeling of relief. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">It’s all over now, now I know what’s going to happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">It was just like, like the biggest load was lifted off my shoulders and I know that was such a, a paradox. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">That I was angry, very very angry at the same time so relieved. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And I don’t remember a thing about the Olympics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">QUESTION:  Why were you so relieved? </span><span class="sentence" id="459">18 19
ANSWER:  Well all this time I was worried how, first of all am I going to compete, am I not going to compete, how are they going to eliminate me or what am I going to do if I do compete and I do win a medal and I know the German way to, to acknowledge a victory you stand up on the, on the podium and Heil Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And I didn’t see that happening for me too easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">That would, I mean how can you expect a German girl to stand there and, and raise her arm in the Hitler salute.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  You mean a Jewish girl?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  A Jewish girl and this was on my mind for 2 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And all of a sudden I didn’t have to worry about it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And there was a, a terrific relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  Did you also think about the crowd reaction or the government reaction to a win on your part?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  Had I won the Olympics or had I been allowed to compete in the Olympics I would have been a loser either way. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Cause had I won there would have been such a, an insult against the German psyche. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">How can the, a Jew be good enough to win the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Then I would have had to be afraid for my life, ’m sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And had I lost I would have been made as a joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">See we knew that you couldn’t have, couldn’t do this and that, that was on my mind all these years.</span></p>

ANSWER:  In the high jump, usually there are always three competitors for each event, three in the dash, and three in the shot put and three in the long jump and they only had two girls in the high jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And that was a little bit unusual and a long, a long time later I found out that the team was told that Bergman is injured and cannot compete. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">But I also had the suspicion that they were trying to maneuver this whole thing because a letter was sent around that those who were in Olympic candidates should not expect to be chosen in some of them and that they did not measure up and that only in some events there would only be 2 competitors and I think that was really done for my sake already. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Because they were already trying to get rid of me somehow, maybe, I’m not sure but it, it seemed to be very unusual that there would only be two girls in the high jump.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="601">QUESTION:  ...think about 1936, what impact on your life, these experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">ANSWER:  I think it made me a lot tougher, you know to face what, what I had to face and life here was very, very hard in the beginning, I worked as a housemaid for $10 a week and even though life was a lot cheaper then, you couldn’t get very far on $10 a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And my husband worked as a house painter, being a physician he worked as a house painter when he, when he arrived over here. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">It made us, I think tougher you know but what we went through and it might have helped us even though it was pretty tough <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to go through. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">24 25
QUESTION:  Anything else you want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">ANSWER:  Well one thing I, I should mention maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I recently got a letter from the National, German National Olympic committee and they invited me to be their guest of honor at the Atlanta Olympic games from July the 19" until August the 3" And although I have never gone back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they invited me before for some other occasion, I have accepted the invitation and I think it will be a very emotional thing for me but I, I think I said to my husband what goes around comes around and I think P’ve got to make my peace with this thing at least even though it, it’s it gnawed on me all these years you know and every time the Olympics come around, I I get mad as hell again, I say why, why did this happen tome. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And but I’ve got to make peace before I go wherever I’m going to go, up or down, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So I’m looking forward to that and I think it was a very gesture. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">They have tried to and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where I come from also they have tried very hard to make amends. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">They take care of the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Not a single Jew went back to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">But the, the citizens of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> take care of the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and they have Jewish artists come. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">They have ,they have all kinds of activities to not to let the Jewish life that once was there die. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And I think that is that helped me too because even though I would have, I never, never thought of going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I was invited 3 times from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to go and some people went and they had a very good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I said no, I will never set foot on German soil again. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And I won’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I don’t know how long [’ll last but Pll never go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">But I did accept that invitation and I’m looking forward to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">QUESTION:  One last question...boycott or whatever that it would have made any difference in terms of what followed the Olympics?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">ANSWER:  Any boycott that would have happened would have influenced only the Olympic games that it would not have been the huge success that Hitler expected from it but Hitler and Nazis they would have gone on no matter what, even if only one other <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> would have shown up to, to participate in the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I don’t think it had anything to do with what he wanted to accomplish. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">He wanted to conquer the world and he, he, he would have gone forward no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And I don’t think that the Olympics in that respect had anything to do with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="626">QUESTION:  ...feelings about Jewish athletes in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> who did participate...
ANSWER:  Well there are two trends of thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">They could have stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> or they could have come and showed what a Jew could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">As a matter of fact, I think high jump was won by a Czech, a Jewish girl and I think that was like spitting in Hitler’s eye, see a Jews, they can do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And I think there were some that didn’t come and that was their, whatever they wanted to decide about their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">But I think they only hurt themselves and they, it didn’t make any, it didn’t make an impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">You know I think it had more, more impact for the Jews to go there and, and beat the Germans than, than to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and say I’m not going. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I have that 25 26 much respect for myself that I won’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I don’t think that that, was, the ones that did it I respect them for it but the ones who didn’t they have my respect too because they did what I would have done, beat the Nazis.
