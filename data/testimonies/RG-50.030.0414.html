<p><span class="sentence" id="1164">ANSWER:  Yes, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1165">QUESTION:  And we didn’t say it at all.</span></p>

I did not know I was alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Should I go back? </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">I stayed with them overnight, then I went back, I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">Do I still have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go or...? </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">But it was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">It became the very fast the Kristallnacht, like a flash, and then it was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Well, it was never gone.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1182">QUESTION:  All right, when we ended the last tape, you were talking about the fact that your numbers were coming up, but I want you to explain because many people don’t know what an affidavit is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1183">ANSWER:  An affidavit is this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">You must have somebody in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> who is willing to send you papers for you to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">They are believed to be write out, but you have to show proof of support, that you have the means, that I will not be a burden to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> until I’m a citizen.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1189">ANSWER:  An affidavit is you have to find someone — it does not have to be a relative — who’s willing to send you papers to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and the papers has to show what he owns, income tax and so on — that he’s really, if 1t comes to it, that he’s able to support me, and that I will never be a burden to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as long as I’m not a citizen anymore, because if I’m a citizen, it is expected that I support myself if I’m able. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">So, Muriel sent me that affidavit, but — not Muriel, Sam Menczel; Muriel sent it for Eddie — but you had to wait for a quota number. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">There’s only — somebody might send somebody a hundred affidavits and only a certain number are allowed to enter every year to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and there it was important from which <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> you came from. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">For instance, if you came from <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> , it was very easy to enter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">They will give you numbers because Scandinavian people had no interest to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">So, we had to wait for our numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">And so, it was very hard until you get to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">I got right off. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I got the numbers, but the Germans had to give me all the permission to get that number that I’m clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">I have all the — did I tell you the story how I worked as a maid?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1199">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1200">ANSWER:  I did not tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1202">QUESTION:  Is that before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1203">ANSWER:  Before that, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">It was the largest <span class="BUILDING">library</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">It was like a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">They did not want to give me that number yet, so one man who had looked over the income tax, “I have a mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">She’s old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">She’s sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">If you find me, if you arrive, you will work for me as a maid, when she’s all done, maybe I will let you go and your family.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">So, I took the job and it was a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">She was so mean to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">I worked day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">She was very sick and didn’t give me practically anything to eat, but God help me she died after three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">So, that was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">He went into Eddie’s <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , took out the nicest <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> he wanted to, and said, “Now you have the numbers, too.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">And, he also — Eddie, not me.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1225">ANSWER:  No, his family — his mother perished, and Eddie had an affidavit for Muriel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">I told you already the story how she called and she said, am I right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1227">QUESTION:  So, how is it when you got the affidavit from my cousin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1228">ANSWER:  My cousin Sam Menczel.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1229">QUESTION:  And that’s the only affidavit that you had?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1230">ANSWER:  Yeah, I didn’t need anymore
QUESTION:  Right, you just needed the one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1231">ANSWER:  You just need one affidavit.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1256">QUESTION:  Can I just ask you a question?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1257">ANSWER:  Because it had to be clear before the things are interwoven.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1258">QUESTION:  Why did you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1259">ANSWER:  Pll tell you why I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">You did not know from one day to another that if you will be alive, do you understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">Whoever would help you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">It was — why did my brother? </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">He did not even have a temporary visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">It was like sent from <span class="NPIP">Heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">I was safe for several months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">She must have — she gave me money, Muriel.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1296">QUESTION:  Where did you go, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> or no?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1297">ANSWER:  What did you say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1298">QUESTION:  Where were you in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1299">ANSWER:  I tell you, I was in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">I was because wherever they would let you in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Davos</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">I stayed two days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">I started to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Then I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , I'll tell you why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">The visa came to an end soon, my Swiss visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">I promised I would be out of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">Here I was caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">I couldn’t go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">The Swiss didn’t let me there because they prolonged it once, and that was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">I didn’t know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">I tried — I started to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">My brother was either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Reins</span> or someplace called me and said, “You have to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">They won’t let you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">But I did not know what, so he said, “Look, I will tell you all this on the phone, let me tell you what to do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">He said, “Take your belongings.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">I didn’t have much, “Go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">There is a League of Nations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">There is a very prominent lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">You go down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">He might not want to do a thing for you, but he has it in his power. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">If he wants to, he will help you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">I took like my last money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">Don’t ask me, I don’t know why I’m there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">I come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">I find the telephone number where the prominent lawyer is, had a hard time to get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">He didn’t want to talk to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">How I did it, I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">I reached him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">I talked to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">He was very touched. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">I don’t know — people were somehow taken by me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">It’s just — So, he said, “I will help you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">Yeah, my brother said to me, “Look if nobody helps you there, the League of Nations, you have to go illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">You have to go over the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">It could take you days until you get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">There <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , mountain passes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">There are <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">You will have to hike. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">If the Swiss find you, there’s no end to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">They will send you right back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">The idea that I should be as thin as I was and there was nothing but me, all by myself, scared stiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">Well, I talked to that lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">He called up a very prominent, very high official at the League of Nations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">I understood French some. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">I did not understand quite enough to understand while he was talking, and he said, “You have to help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">You have to see her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">Do what you want, but you have to talk to her.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">She didn’t want to talk to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">He was pleading with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">She agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">I think they were probably very close with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">I go over to the League of Nations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">I have no idea anymore did I walk, I had no money for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">I got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">I meet her, fantastic <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , very elegant woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">She was awfully nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">She took a look at me, and she said to me, “Don’t talk at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">Did you eat yet?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">I said, “No.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">She rings a little bell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">They bring in a fabulous breakfast with orange juice and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">I thought it was not here, it was <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">She said, “Yes, I will help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">I will give you a temporary visa you will get to go to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">And she said she will give me toa ___—_—_s so I was relatively safe for a short period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">In the meantime, the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the <span class="DLF">borders</span> were closed, and I did not need to go out right now, but Eddie called me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">He said, “Leney, I received my — I have my visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">I have the number.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">I told you that before. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1373">I have everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">What will you do now? </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">Your number is up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">If you don’t come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in two, three days, your number will be given to somebody else.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">So, you realize the tremendous problem, not going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> meant I would never be with Eddie again, because he’s going to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I wouldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">I didn’t have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">Going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> was a tremendous danger, almost 100 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">They would send me right off into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . “</span><span class="sentence" id="1381">You have signed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">You have signed it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">I talk my friends, she wouldn’t want to hide me in order to force me not to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">I said, “I have nothing to lose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">I will try to go back.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">And here comes the story about going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">As far as I knew, I will not be able to make it because the Germans will send me right off into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">Now, I needed in order to go back, I needed a visa, a German visa, to enter <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">Well, I think, “Let me try.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">I get my stuff together, go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> , and I go to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> — a tremendous, big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , a lot of people are waiting there in front to get in, maybe a hundred or more, but this — none of them were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">These were all gentile people who had business, who wanted to go back, everybody needed a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">They were standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">It was not open yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">They were standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> for quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">Suddenly a Gestapo man, an SS man, comes out, but he says first, “Heil Hitler, heil Hitler.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">Everybody in the group, “Heil Hitler, heil Hitler’ and he says, “I have to give you a message.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">He says, “You all can go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">Yesterday they tried to assassinate Hitler.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">And he called him the Furor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">If you said the Furor, this is the highest word instead of Hitler. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1401">The Furor has given orders nobody’s allowed to enter the <span class="DLF">border</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">To go out, not ‘til you hear from me at a later date, I do not know when. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">The people all went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">Within seconds that tremendous <span class="NPIP">place</span> was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">The only person who was standing there was myself, and two of the Nazis, the higher officials, Gestapos. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1406">What do you want?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">You get like so rigid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">You do not know what to do, what is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">You act, or you don’t act. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">So, what should I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">No gentile, no Christian, nobody can get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">I’m frightened to death, but I had only one desire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">I want to be with Eddie. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">If I can’t be with Eddie, I might as well die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">And I thought and I thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">I had to get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">I started march to the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">Nobody’s marching with me anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">Everybody left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">And I see the big <span class="DLF">door</span> and SS men, Gestapo, all these women screaming “Heil Hitler, heil Hitler.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">Standing straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">I went up to the <span class="DLF">door</span> that I did almost consciously, I shouldn’t be scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">I should walk straight like I would look like I know where I was going to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">I had no idea where the consul was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">I had no idea how he looked, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">And, I was sure that they’d send me back at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , nobody can get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">I mean, I’m on <span class="REGION">German territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">I walk straight to the <span class="DLF">door</span> , grab the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and open it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">I did it so fast that it didn’t occur. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">It probably looked like Iam one from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">I was just “In I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">In I am.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">Tremendous <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , no idea should I go right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">Should I go left? </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">Should I go straight? </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">Let’s see, which one could it be? </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">I go straight and I start walking — walk, walk, walk — suddenly I come to a big <span class="DLF">door</span> , and I thought to myself, “It looks very impressive to enter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">If I get <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , “Gestapo,” I said in my mind, “might be in.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">I don’t ask anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">I didn’t talk to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">I go to the <span class="DLF">door</span> and open it, and I’m <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">In front of me a big beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and a man sitting there, Iam God Almighty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">I assume right off this is the consul. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">Next to him, Gestapo, and guns, and you name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">And he looked at me, didn’t address me, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">Who was I? </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">You needed permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">You need an invitation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">You just didn’t walk in that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">And he said to me, “Well, what would you like? </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">Who are you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">And I start talking quickly, I said, “I have to have — I have to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">I have to get an American visa in order to go’, and I stop talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">He starts screaming, “You’re Jewish! </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">You’re Jewish!” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1457">Yes, Iam Jewish.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1458">You dare. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">You dare to come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">How did you get in?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">I started to say something. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1462">Get out of here right away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">And I tell him what I want. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">He said, “No Christian, no Jew, nobody is allowed to get in.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">And he said, “Go!” </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">And I looked at him, and he’s furious at all the people who work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">I said, “I’m not going.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">He said, “You’re not? </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">We are in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ,” he said, “You will go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">You will — looking at you, how you look, you won’t survive it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">You won’t survive it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">He said to me, “Go!” </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">Then, something in his voice got soft, and he said to me, “Go, go, please go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">Nothing will happen to you here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">I will see that you get out, get you again on <span class="REGION">Swiss territory</span> , but please go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">He looked at me. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1477">I’m not going.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">He repeated this two or three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">Then, so far, he says, “I wouldn’t want anything should happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">Go!” </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">And I said, “I won’t go because if I go, I will never see my fiancé, and that’s the end.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">And he said, “I cannot give it to you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">And, he started again, “Go,” and then he shows to the men, he said, “Take her and lead her out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">I said, “I’m not going to walk.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">He looked at me with a pierced look. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">His eyes were lethal, but he said, “Lift her up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">There was not much to lift. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1488">Lift her up and carrying her out, and out the <span class="DLF">door</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">Two men, one on the right, the other on the left hand — they carried me to the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span
