QUESTION:  And you were there in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  I was there and sitting there, but I remembered what they did, what they do in . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">It's very hard to explain but as I'm sitting now, and I was fifteen years old, I thought and I was wondering if I would have a grenade, I would kill myself and I would kill Rosenberg and Gros and Koch and all of them in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , if I could have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">This was just a childish way, but the bitterness what what I held from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They killed twenty-two Jews and and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">You lived every day, but this was just, you know, something...a dream what a child can can dream, I would do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">It's even foolish to repeat but I'm repeating it what my thoughts were at that time, and while I was there, Gros said...this I remember...Herr Rosenberg, Herr Mint...Herr Mini... Herr Reichsminister...that's how they...I remember the word...Herr Reichsminister, . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">We are very productive Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">This was the question...are you a productive? </span><span class="sentence" id="239">We thought at that time yet if you are a productive Jew, they'd let you live. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">If you're not a productive, they they will kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">You see, the Germans, they were doing so systematically and I don't have to go into it because this was...a lot of people, everybody knows their system, you know, so I'm not going into it, but we thought...still thought that if we are so productive, if Rosenberg comes to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to us, we must be important, so he said, Herr Reichsminister, how's about to let us live. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So for our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...you know we're only three thousand Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">We're productive. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">We're working for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Let us live.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  Let me ask this. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Gros was Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  All the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Jewish and Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">He had a Jewish girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">He was married to a Jewish , and he never knew that he was going to be involved...he was a...the time put him in he was an engineer from from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , that time put him in to made...to be a leader, todo, buthe wasfrom â€”_and_â€”si, the ~â€”â€”_â€”=Â«, you know toa Jewish cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">He was not just a Jewish but he worked for the Germans, but this is...he wanted to save and he he wanted to save himself too, but being that he was the the whole...the whole , you know, the the key from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and with the Germans it's if you went to the higher echelon you could talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">It was just like uh said...whoever's a Jew, II decide. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">You understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So when you talk to them, even if 1t was Rosenberg, the biggest murderer, or Koch, but if you were sitting with them, you talked like I'm talking with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">But he also said, they said Herr Gros, and this was the true words what I heard, . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I'm sorry to tell you...see he was...Germans were usually very polite, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">They kill you but they're very nice and very civilized. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And they said . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">He didn't say you are Jew or death. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">No. ; </span><span class="sentence" id="263">butI havea _, [have an order from the...I'm I'm repeating in German because his words...I'm...1n my in my mind...I have order from Fuhrer that the ... that means that no Jews can be alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Then I started to think about...see before I didn't, but then I started to think, now I cancometo _ and I had that grenade because I saw that there's no end. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Once he said this and he was...he was the god. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">He was...he was the life and death. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">When they went, Gros, my father, the owner, said there's no solution for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">We have no time. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And we started to dig a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> at night, throwing out the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and dirt and digging and putting away the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> nobody should know, and we did this and this was around August they opened the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">The first time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tuchin</span> , they put in all the Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and also in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> with <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> and all the wheat, the corn what they took away from the peasants, they were storing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">They were storing the wheat full tons of tons. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We told later if you will destroy that, the German army will starve, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I'm talking about myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I said we as a as a young boy, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">We actually moved into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> but we had passes to go to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where we lived half-time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was an open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">You could come in and out. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">It wasn't like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> that police was around surrounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Again, through the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and through Gros and also the commandant knew that if Rosenberg comes in, he is good with Gros. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">He was the nicest guy and tried to accommodate because they were...Germans were always scared about higher. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Gros may say something that we're not treated right, so even they were scared, so they treated us like with...the whole the whole Jewish and he promised them that nothing will happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">He didn't hear...he didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">The commandant from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> didn't know what Rosenberg, what I knew, when I was nobody but but we knew through Gros and we didn't tell nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Gros said not to say a word not to put a panic. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">The only people...I think what Gros did he went to the Jewish leadership there and told them that there's no solution, no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So we lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and 1t came August and my father was going, still stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , you know, and didn't come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and two days before Yom Kippur, September I think it was...I can't remember the date...the Jewish community surrendered the Jews, came together. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">They gave whoever was young they gave bottles of acid, you know, sulfuric acid. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">There was a few guns, a few deaths, which I didn't...I heard but I didn't see but a few young people had some, but they said if the Germans will come in, let's not die because we knew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> they took them to the <span class="DLF">grave</span> and they shot one by one. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Let's kill as many Germans as we can. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Let's burn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">QUESTION:  Had you or anyone uh seen these mass murders in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> or you just heard about them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  People...if you saw them, you didn't hear about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">You understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="294">We came...we came to...the closest I can say whoever worked with the mass murderers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> was like me and Gros sitting there, two miles away from the mass murders, and he said they're killing Jews and then we saw the <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And then we saw there's no...see we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> later. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">There were <span class="DLF">graves</span> but there was no Jews, so if you saw them, you didn't talk about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">You understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Because there was no way to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Does this answer your question? </span><span class="sentence" id="300">You couldn't...you couldn't be there and escape because they were surrounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">We were talked about it and there were...you see, there was not only Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">The problem was the Ukrainians were worse than the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">They made sure that nobody should escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">You could escape from a a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , from a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but you couldn't escape if they surrounded you and they and they have mass...mass that you couldn't escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">There was no escape, not one to my knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">But we saw the <span class="DLF">graves</span> later. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I saw it where where they killed...it took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">We saw...this I saw before...the day before Yom Kippur that the Ukrainians were building right...not far. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We could look...start digging <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">They didn't take any Jews to dig. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Normally they took Jews to dig graves, but we, the three thousand people, very strong, very healthy because we had a good life till then, through the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and through Gros' influence, we're not starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Normally, the Germans starved that the people didn't have the strength to fight, to to resist. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">They starved them out slowly, slowly that they lost their fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">We were strong and healthy, not hungry, so when you have strength, you fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">You understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="316">You don't...you do whatever you could because you still have strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">That was the only difference and we saw that they're building <span class="DLF">graves</span> and the day before Yom Kippur I remember I went out and I and I opened...it was a beautiful day I remember and I said it's so gorgeous. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">It's so beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I'm fifteen years old and I have...and I have to die in this <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I kept...I...a day before Yom Kippur, my father came into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">This I remember...they asked him why do you come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Why do you come backâ€™? </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So he said, I want to be with my children. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I...me and my... and my sister were were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and then that they surrounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">You couldn't go out already. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Before we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Took away the passes, you know, the last day we couldn't get back, but in...they let in, so he didn't have to come but he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Naturally some fathers, you know, a father is a father. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">He wanted to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So we were talking, the the â€”_. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">We knew they're digging <span class="DLF">graves</span> and we knew...we didn't know how they're going to come, how we have to fight them, how you have to use the bottles and whatever and right after Yom Kippur in the evening when I [...around four...become dark, I fell asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">What the Germans wanted to do was send in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and grab a few hundred people at a time and to take them out and to shot them and come back, slowly, gradually because they didn't want a fight because they didn't know...we were too too strong and too...they didn't have a division there, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">They had...but they had the police and what I remember is I fell asleep and I woke up and I saw fire, more fire yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">You know, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish towns</span> were wooden...wooden <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">They were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I woke up and I knew that it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I looked for my father and sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Couldn't find anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">It was already fire, burning, yelling, people were burning, and the the Germans used a <span class="DLF">wooden gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">They didn't have to build a strong <span class="DLF">gate</span> around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because there was...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was only short time that they had it from wood, so we had to run, to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I kept the bottles and whoever was right there, the Germans were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">We start throwing, throwing. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Then the Germans start...this I saw, the Germans start burning the face. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">You know, when you...ashes when you get in face, it's not so pleasant, you know, but we knew that we can't, so what they did, they regrouped, and they got in one <span class="NPIP">side</span> with the machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">They saw that they can't do it and and it was also the order the first thing to burn the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the corn and the wheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">This was...if you have to die, let the food burn. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Let them not...let them starve, you know, and our mind this was the the whole salvation because if if you 1f you think you catch...they say a razor blade, you know, even if you cut yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">This was so far what we were talking to burn the the...nothing we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">We were...we were defenseless. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So I remember that I walked...while they were shooting from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> I walked to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I don't know if it's northeast...I I don't know...and I, with this arm yet I pushed...and the hundreds of people with me, we pushed the the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">The <span class="DLF">gate</span> fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Then the <span class="DLF">gate</span> fell down and we had to climb it. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">We started running. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">People started running, but when we start running, there was a <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Usually the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was right and the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> was on on the <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">The Germans, they were shooting but the bullets mostly hit the stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Whoever fell, fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Mostly they didn't do much but because they hit the stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">You know, we were after that...
QUESTION:  So the gravestones gave you cover?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  The gravestones gave us cover. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Otherwise nobody would have survived because they were standing there and we were on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">The gravestones gave us cover and I knew when I...I can recall even now when I was running I knew every minute I would be hit from the back, but the stones...just you hear bouncing, you know, bouncing bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">It was...and here the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was already...was burning.

professional barber, and he had food he had brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">But he had food for himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">We had to go at night or in daytime and to beg for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">My shoes were gone, so I had from wood made, you know, rags and that and around and we were every...once a week we were going to to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and to ask for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish village</span> was too far and it was cold but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ukrainian village</span> was closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">One day I went into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> with another girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">The girl which was was theirs. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">She later died, and we knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and the la...my feet

food and start knocking at the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">They knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , came in Ukrainian . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">You knew that the who come in, they'll see a Jewish fellow They'll kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">They came in and one man was from from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tuchin</span> and he knew about my father, about Gros, so he said today we don't kill Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">That was his word. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I remember when they knocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">They came in, about five, six men, so I asked him how come. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">You see, because it was...I asked questions which normally, in normal time you don't...you don't ask, but there was a question that I knew they do, you understand, and I asked him that question how come you don't kill today, so he said because we are now negotiating with the Russian partisans to fight against the Germans and it will take about another three days, and we better not catch you. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">If it doesn't go through, we better not catch you in three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">They gave me the best food what I had in months. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">They treated me nice and they told me to go, so actually it's Just like you were in the lion's...1n the lion's den and you escaped in the right time. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So you see, I...so I start asking myself questions, how can luck bring you because he told me if we would catch you yesterday, we would have killed you because this just came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">So I went back and I stayed there in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , you know, but I was hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">You had to go again to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">What did we get? </span><span class="sentence" id="610">We get potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Boiled potatoes without salt, the stomach can _ but that was the only thing what they gave us and some...we had <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">One time I went into a <span class="BUILDING">Ukrainian house</span> for begging. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I didn't know where I'm going, and the man took...you know, for a fork what with they cut hay and he he throwed at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I jumped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I was young still and I jumped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I was alert and it went through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Otherwise it would went through me, and I run out because he didn't...he didn't like me, but somebody else, the same Ukra...the Ukrainians gave me food. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">They gave me a few potatoes and some toldmecome over _, . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">This I remember because I I learned Ukrainian or even if I wasn't a native there, I was a stranger, but this was . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Some have a war and to some people, there's a war and to some it doesn't matter (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="621">You understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="622">For them, it's the matter (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="623">They live good now. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">But a month later I went again with the same...I I walked with the same girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">There was other <span class="NPIP">places</span> but she lived in the same...1n the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> so we went to back together. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">You had to go about three, five miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">This was...already the snow was very high but we always tried to go when it's snowing that the Germans shouldn't come back and find out where we are, so when the snow start falling, we walked and then it fell back so it shouldn't leave any...you get...when you live in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , you get very smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">You...you learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Though I never lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ... was born in a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you get to learn like , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">You get to learn how to live with the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">nature</span> and I remember we walked out to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and maybe thirty people, Ukrainians, surrounded us, both of us and they said where should be kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Here or in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="632">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> was like from here to next <span class="DLF">block</span> , two <span class="DLF">blocks</span> so they...the others said why should we kill here. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">We'll take them to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">There nobody had to bother with him and while I was talking, the leader was talking to me, an old lady, an old woman, came out and she happened to be the mother of the leader.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">QUESTION:  You're saying that the same old lady you'd seen before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">ANSWER:  No, no, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">This was different story. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">The mother of the the other one was a police Ukrainian...a German Ukrainian policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">He...this one was a . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">They were partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">See, it's different...between working for the Germans as police and being, you know, like like a like SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Those were partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">They were fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">See, the Germans, the Ukrainians worked for the Germans, were German helpers on the German payroll. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">This were Ukrainian partisan which wanted a free <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">They were nationalists. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">They killed Jews the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">It has nothing to do but with the nationalists, their aim was not to so much love to the Germans but love to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , to to <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> and to have a free...and they thought the Germans would give them which they would never do, but they thought the Germans would give them a free <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">You see, you know, politics was involved in that, but that was a different...but the old lady, the mother from the leader, from that Ukrainian run out and she grabbed the gun from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I remember a small lady and he was a tall guy, a strong guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Somehow he didn't expect because the mother, she start to to hug him and she grabbed the gun and she was holding the gun to him, and she said those are two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">If you kill them, I'll kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I I remember that the other Ukrainians, you know, they they got they got kind of shocked, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">She was a good woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">She meant it just why should they kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And they said run. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Run to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">We start running and every minute, even the the five hundred or thousand yards was like miles because I thought somebody from them would shot me, but she would have killed him probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">They would shot me in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">We run in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and we were free already. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">We were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Again things like that doesn't happen, but 1t happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">But we realized...there were about five boys of us and my age...we realized that there's no life to go and beg and to to be killed, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Someday the luck will run out and the same time we we dropped the Polish, the the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ukrainian villages</span> and went further to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish villages</span> , but the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish village</span> , the Polish people...there were three hundred and eighty people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">They were very nice to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">They gave us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">They were working with the partisans and one day they were surrounded by Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">The Germans sent in the army, the regular army and they took all the men and they shot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Three hundred and eighty people they shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">The women, they shot and they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">They they poisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">They didn't shot them but they gave them some some injection, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Nobody, not one survived from that the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">That was a few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish villages</span> , where they shot everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">They did the same thing what they did, claiming that they are sympathetic to the to the partisan, to the Russian partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So we...the <span class="DLF">roads</span> to beg or to eat were cut off, so we decided, five of us, that we are going to look for the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">We knew that the Russian partisans, there was a Russian partisan by the name of . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">That's Colonel Niewiedow (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Niewiedow. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">They were the lead partisan organization in the whole <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> which eighty percent were sent out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Normally there were two kind of partisans, the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">There were partisans they organized, natives, whoever wanted but the Ukrainians were against the Russians, so they didn't have much to organize. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">They had a very rough deal because they were against them, so they had to bring Russian people to fight the Germans, and those were the the true partisan uh to send out, you know, from . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Later I found out seventy percent were Spanish people, not for Spanish but <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , for Franco (ph), the ones what were in the civil war. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">That was a real intellectual...the real...the war that's coming in was were fighting Franco. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">When Franco won the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> didn't play much. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">They trained them and they they...Russian always was like <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , fighting to the last Eng...to the last Indian soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">The Russians did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">They sent them out because it was a very dangerous mission, to send out the Spanish Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Again, they didn't want them in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> because they had enough Communists there. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">As you can see, I'm not such a great lover although they saved my life, you know, but that's the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">That was Spanish...very fine, very fine people, very...very...they were not the average Russian partisan, the average soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Each one was with a personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">We met some Ukrainian...some partisans and they told us sorry, we don't take. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="698">See, without without ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">We said how we get ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Go take a stick and kill a German, take his gun or his rifle and come to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Then you'll fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">It's easier said than to do because the Germans were twelve feet tall in our eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">We were young and anyway the Germans were the the the rulers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">How can you go and kill? </span><span class="sentence" id="705">II stayed away as far as I can from a German and they told us to take a stick and kill a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Again, the same story. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Everybody was . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">So we decided, four of us, four or five young boys...there's only way how to get to the partisans, cause we knew we can't survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">We didn't know when it's going to end and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">It was forty below zero with no clothing, no food, no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">The older people stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We're going to see how the the horses with the with the sleds, and we're going to follow and it happened that we saw a partisan with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sled</span> and he happened to be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">We went over to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">We told him who we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">He said I can't take you, but follow...don't say a word but follow my <span class="DLF">road</span> and you'll get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">That's all he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">He went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">We waited for an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">It wasn't snowing, and we followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">We followed maybe five, six miles, and once we we were going, they came out and said hand, you know, raise your hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And they took all five five of us separate <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">How did you get here? </span><span class="sentence" id="723">So I said we saw...we were looking for the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">We want to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">We are against the Germans and we saw a <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">We want to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Where are your guns? </span><span class="sentence" id="728">We don't have any guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">We're going to send you back and we made up, if they told us they send back, what we have to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">We have to say two things we agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">We want to be killed by a Russian bullet, not by German. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">That was appeal (ph) to the Russians, and if they...if we'll see they don't want to take us, they should be aware that if the Germans catch us, we don't...we're not responsible what we're going to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">We had to use threat. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">To use threat to the Russians was pretty desperate, but we had no other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">They they took each one because they thought they didn't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  And these these were the parti...the partisans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="737">ANSWER:  These were partisans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">QUESTION:  The the Russians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">They didn't know if the Germans sent us. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">They didn't know how we got there and they were...had to be careful too so they took each one separate and start asking questions, how we got to them, because if we can get to them, the Germans can get to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">You understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="743">So we didn't blame them. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">They heard one saying we want to...we want to fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">We wanted this, and they decided to take us in because...decided not because we want to die for them but they were afraid that if the Germans catch us, they would...we will say...I mean they would say or something...they will they will force us, you know, to to say where they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">So the Germans were not close, but they were afraid to go in because they didn't know how strong the partisans are, and they also didn't know...you can't attack somebody in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> because a division can't do...they didn't have that many divisions but they can't send in because they don't know where they're going to be hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">You can hide, you know, three people, ten people, a hundred can keep up a whole a whole brigade if you don't know where you're going to be hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Soon as they took us in, they took all our clothes because we were in a horrible stage. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">They burned everything what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">They gave us new clothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">It was like a <span class="NPIP">paradise</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="752">They gave us...they had the same thing made from wood, but they had I remember uh uh Persian carpets were laid down. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">It was something like a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Next day came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">They took us to the commandant, you know, to the chief took us there, starting to ask the story, and who was sitting there...Gros. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Gros saw me. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Start hugging. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">The commandant looked...start hugging and kissing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">He said why didn't you say something. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">How would I know? </span><span class="sentence" id="761">We would have taken you in right away and I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">He took me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">He was the engineer, the â€”â€”_. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">He was the...this this partisan specially was sent in to break, to undermine <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">The Germans were sending <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to the front and they also cut the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> in order to be safe because they had machine guns on top because the partisans were...their mission was to destroy all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> because if you less ammunition will go to the front, the less the Russians will be killed and that was their mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">They were . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">In Russian it is . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Their mission was to to...very dangerous there because about twenty feet, thirty feet they cut out all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> so you had to take off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they were standing on top watching, so what did we do?

too much, because I was...anyway ___...and you ask too many questions, you didn't survive too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">I asked...there was once a meeting from from the division, our division and they asked us...I asked a question, a very naive question but a very normal question to me as a westerner, you know, and even if I was young, but I learned it and I read about it and

id="1283">The truth 1s...I found out later that it is true...but Stalin said no because he didn't want any Comm...any Socialists should win in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span

no question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">Something what Stalin did that that was enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">Anyway, the general told me...I had to put in something from political. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">I couldn't I couldn't help it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">You can cut out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">I don't care,

that question, and he could have gotten ten years <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> or never see the sun, but that was their their system. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">The general told me he can do one thing for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">He wants to help me, but I take my life in my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">He can give me a pass, you know, in
