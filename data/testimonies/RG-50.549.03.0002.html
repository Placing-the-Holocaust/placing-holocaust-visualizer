ANSWER:  What do you want me -- I -- I just took out my album from our trip to Europe, specifically to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in 1980, and I’m looking at the pictures that were taken on our visit to Frederic Chopin’s birthplace, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zelazowa Wola</span> , which is slightly north, I think- near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , very near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And it’s amazing how vivid the memories of the lovely, lovely music that was played at the -- at the <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">This actually is an old <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> rather than a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a 19" century <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> , with all the furnishings, and of course, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , which is played every now and then. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Remember, she said no -- the guide said absolutely no -- nobody is allowed to play the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> except a famous pianist, remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="6">At which time they take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> out to the <span class="DLF">patio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">So I'd -- later on, of course, after Zelazowa Wola, we went -- you remember this, to the concert? </span><span class="sentence" id="8">A2: Yes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">A2: Yeah, I remember when we sat there, and -- and we were enjoying a concert.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> was placed upo -- A2: Piano recital.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  That was lovely too. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And this was part of our -- my -- our infatuation with -- with Chopin’s music. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So we were just so thrilled that we were able to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">A2: Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I wanted to move ahead to when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , and th-there’s a photograph over here of a -- a -- a group of gypsies who were entertaining, and there’s one amazing --
ANSWER:  Musician. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">A2: -- musician there, he was a -- a midget cripple who played the violin, but he held the violin like a <span class="INT_SPACE">cello</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And he was a1 -- he bowed with his left hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And he played the most difficult music. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I know, because I used to play the violin myself and he did it with such perfection, 1t was just a -- and I was just amazed to see -- to see it being done. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And the others, I -- well, the others I don’t know about because I’m no -- I never played the other --

<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Which was this. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">A2: Oh yes.</span></p>

ANSWER:  So that was -- and even the day -- the morning that we are leaving there was changing of the guards and we saw it from the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">A2: Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  It’s very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And this was the Warsaw ghetto memorial, of course, which we visited. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And after that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , so that was --
QUESTION:  Okay, if you could now just let us -- that’s -- that’s fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">If you could now just maybe sort of le -- not say anything and just lean forward a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  To make the noise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Just to make the noise a little, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Not specially, just the way it is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Here’s a visit to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I remember this was on the square where -- A2: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  -- Jews were rounded up. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Oh here is the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">A2: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starchowice</span> , yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">This is the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> that you liked so well, 19 century <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotive</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">A2: Yeah, you don’t see them any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And this is the Christian family that was of such help to us in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , helped us survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We visited them, remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="86">A2: Mm-hm, sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Now, no talk and just -- just go through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">That’s -- that’s great.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">March 23, 2001
QUESTION:  This is one little scene of -- [tape break]
ANSWER:  -- <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  Well, maybe -- maybe we can do, since I’m having the stir --
ANSWER:  It’s [indecipherable] A2: But you don’t need me here now, I’m going to go back [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  No, no, no, you can go, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  So maybe you close the -- [tape break] [music]. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">What do you want me to say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Where are the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loudspeakers</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  Oh, you want it louder?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Yeah, that would be good. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">If you could. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Where are the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">loudspeakers</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">In here? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I just want about -- [music]. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Even a little louder. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">A-And don’t move your head too much, just kind of like talk into the microphone, or to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Well, I -- you know, I -- I do like classical music a lot, and always have, and I love the human voice, this is why I love opera. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But I adore Chopin, and if you ask me to make a list of composers that I adore, from the top my first is Chopin -- not Victor’s, he | -- he likes him, too, but he prefers Tchaikovsky, but Chopin to me is everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">There’s such delicacy in his piano playing, and there’s such soul, plus the fact that a lot of his music was set to -- was made into songs in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">In fact, I have a record here, it says [indecipherable] that’s complete works of Chopin as they were set to music. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">There are some baritone male voices, and sopranos. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And actually -- this is March 23, 2001 a record I bought while I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but actually, I know about 80 percent of these songs, because as a child I learned them. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">You know, when you learn -- when you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and you have -- in those days, children were taught to sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Well, you were taught also quite often, some of these songs, which at that time I didn’t know they were Chopin, they were just beautiful songs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  You can just start any time you want to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  You asked me about the pictures of my family from before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Of course I have them, and it isn’t because I -- I took them out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , no. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">They were sent to us from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> because my mother was quite involved with training the pioneers for pi -- and for pioneering in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and subsequently these people settled in the old <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and my parents used to send them pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Well, after the war, we were very, very lucky that some of these people whom we located, gave us some of the pictures of -- from my childhood, which I would otherwise never have. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So what I do have in my album, and of course I also have it as a painting, which I had done out of these pictures, a picture of my parents as mature people, and a picture of my parents as- aS an engaged couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And you could see how charming that looks, it’s a sort of an old fashioned kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Mother has a big bow in the back, and they both wear a pince-nez. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And my father has one of these stand-up collars, sort of like a 19" century fashion. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Very charming and I’m delighted to have those. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Then we have a picture of my father, one of them is -- he’s sort of posing, you could see, obviously this was posed in March 23, 2001 the <span class="BUILDING">studio</span> against a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And it’s very official, and rather proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And then there’s one more relaxed, sort of like a -- well, basic portrait type of a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And then I have this group picture of my grandmother on my mother’s side, whose name was Sarah Tanenbloom. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I think I mentioned somewhere in the rec --
QUESTION:  I don’t recall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  This group picture 1s with my mother’s side of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Basically, my grandmother is in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Since she was religious, you could see she’s wearing a wig. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">To her left is my mother, holding my oldest sister, Anna -- Hanya. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Of course, I wasn’t around yet for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">On the other side of Grandma is my Aunt Anja and above in <span class="DLF">second line</span> you have my father’s sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">This is, I think, Lodja. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Then is my mother’s youngest sister, Ruja, my father, my Aunt Regina, my father’s sister, I think this is Frania, and this completes the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And that was taken somewhere in the 20’s and -- ni -- 1920’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And I’m so happy to have this picture, of course, I made copies for my sisters and my kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So we’re very lucky to have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And here is my mother as a very young girl, with my -- with -- with her brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And it also has to be taken somewhere in a -- in a <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> , and 1t makes me laugh when I look at those poses, but this is also charming, lovely. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I also have a very interesting picture of myself here with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And I -- I sort of have a severe look on my face, and -- and I am sitting there with a little cane. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">The reason is that this is a picture of my fa -- of my mother in one of the -- she used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> for -- for her arthritis, and she had to March 23, 2001 have a cane, obviously she was suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So apparently she bought me a little cane. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And I’m sitting on the -- on the -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> , and my mother is standing next to me, and of course I look the way I always did, with the big, thick hair, and a bow in the head -- hair, holding a cane. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And next to it I also have a picture of my sister Chris, Chrisha, with my mother, also at that -- at that <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> , which was the -- the -- the <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> -- the -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">sulphur baths</span> were actually located inside a <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And this 1s outside the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of the <span class="DLF">park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The -- the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buskos Druey</span> , it was in <span class="REGION">central Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Mother used to go there annually for her arthritis. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Let -- let me make sure I know who is who. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">This is Regina, this is Ruja, this is Anja, this is Moish, those are the two sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Yes, okay, just a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Oh, I’ve got it written down, all the sisters were standing there, sister Regina, this is Regina, this one. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Brother Moish, sister Anja, brother Nokrun in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Sister Ruja, that’s -- I had it the opposite way, I’m looking at it li -- and the Kronenburg boys, Bernard and Henrick, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Here is another picture which I have, which shows my mother’s side of the family, which was quite extensive, because there were nine children, and when they grew up, of course they all had children, so the family was very large. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">In this picture I have my mother’s oldest sister, Fela Kronenberg with her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">My mother’s sister, Anja, Regina and Ruja. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">My mother’s brother Moish, and the Kronenberg’s two sons, whose name was Bernard and Henrick. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And of course, except for my Uncle Moish, who emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , this -- everybody in this picture went -- was an-annihilated in -- in the Holocaust, plus March 23, 2001- and this is only one daughter, now just multiply it by nine, and you will get the idea of how many people in that family perished in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">My father’s brother, who survived the war, this was right after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">So let me see, and after this is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Well, here is one more picture, we call it the classic, quote unquote, because we are lined up, posed again as all those pictures were in those years, the three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">The oldest sister Anna -- Hanya, the middle sister Chrisha, Chris, and myself, Renia, Regina. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">We lined up and our kids always laugh at this picture, and they make us -- we- of course, we are a very close family, we always have been extremely close, and -- and because we survived the war together, and -- and the fact that we were never separated during the war, which is almost incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">It just absolutely was a miraculous thing that we were never separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">We were very close then, and we are very close now, and so are our kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So our kids always laugh when they remember this picture, because this is the family classic. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And throughout the years, whenever we have big of -- family occasions, weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, Seders, they make us line up. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And I can show you though the years, I have pictures of the three of us lined up in the exact <span class="NPIP">position</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We have to stand, and we have to stand there like the <span class="DLF">steps</span> , except now we are not <span class="DLF">steps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">In those days one was biggest, one was middle, one was small. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Now we’re sort of varied in size, and we, of course, gotten so much older, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But the point is that I have pictures through the years, in the same arrangement as this classic picture, so that this is just for the joke of it, and every album that you look through, as March 23, 2001 I have them all lined up, you will always find a picture of the three sisters lined up in that fashion. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">You know, I look at these albums now, and I remember [indecipherable] them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , which was a part of our -- that’s where our outings wer -- took place, because we lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlactensee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And as I look at these pictures with my friends, one of it has the bombed out <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Gives you an idea that this was only one year after the war ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But we look like real schoolgirls out for a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And we had a very -- I always talk about the experience in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> as one of the nicest, because I was really still a child, and there was every effort made to have all the children who were at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> at that time, to have those children come back to the life of a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Of course, there was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> established, and -- because children were coming in at all ages, and with all educational backgrounds, we were sorted out, so to say, by age, because this was primarily a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , even though the subjects were -- the curriculum was like any other <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , except it was all in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And basically the kids who went to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> really, truly identified with the group, even though some of the children were orphans and came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> with cousins or others. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Some were children with parents who came out of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I had one friend, Tunia, who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and she was my age, and she was in that class. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Now we had, in addition -- in -- in addition to having courses, we were also given a special <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> where we will go -- we all attended, we all had special lunches, and of course we always had chocolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And in the evenings we went March 23, 2001 for dances. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I don’t think it was every evening, it was probably about once or twice a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And over there we could already mix with the what you call grown-up group, because after all, we were -- I ha -- I was among the group that was the oldest, and we weren’t even what you call grown people yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">But over there the boys were lovely, and they were a little older, but they didn’t mind dancing with girls who are younger but knew how to dance, and there was an orchestra. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And the music played -- I now realize, when I hear some of it in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> -- not now, but years ago when they used to play that, that the music that was very popular in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in the 30’s was what was played by these dancing -- dancing -- dance bands for us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlactensee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And lo and behold, when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I heard those songs again, except they said, oh, these songs are old, and Nat King Cole will sing it, or other popular entertainer singers of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And of course, to this day, every time somebody plays very old records, and they play one of those, I never associate it with <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , because I really learned it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So --
QUESTION:  Do you remember one? </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Sing -- sing one, or s -- hum it a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  Oh yes, of course, my voice isn’t there, but I remember this one song, “Kiss me once, and kiss me twice, and kiss me once again. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">It’s been a long, long, time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I’m sorry, I can’t sing cause I just had a cold, so I have a scratchy voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Anyhow, I have here these different boys that I used to dance with, and of course group pictures with others, and it’s -- it’s really just wonderful with -- we seem to be having a very great, March 23, 2001 wonderful time, which we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Because I really remember all this with great affection, and how -- what a nice relationships we all established with the boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I mean, each one of us, the group of girls that I was close to, and there were four of us that were very close at that time, and we had a relationship with boys that was really lovely, it was friendly, and it -- it was really -- 1t was just -- just -- just -- just nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">I have a few pictures of the four of us here, and three of us remain very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Actually, all four except unfortunately two of us are gone -- we’re gone now. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And in fact, I have a picture much later on, that I might show you, when we took a -- the four of us got together, and we have a picture like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  Can you describe a little bit more the -- I mean s -- a lot of people have not so pleasant memories of -- of -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Could you describe a little bit what it looked like, what -- what the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself was -- sort of looked like and -- and what your memories are of it, that are very different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  Well, 1 -- actually, what I remember is that we lived in <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , I have the pictures of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">The <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were any -- not much to -- to brag about, they were, I think, some old, leftover <span class="BUILDING">army barracks</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But when you’re young, and you come back to -- to living a life of a young girl, who cares if you live in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> or if you live in a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Because, as you could see from the album, we were celebrating different holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">For example, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lach Baroma</span> , as you could see, we are all dressed in school uniforms, which is a white blouse and a navy blue skirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">We went to the -- March 23, 2001 somewhere out -- it was an outing, like a picnic type. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And we used to go to -- this is a very interesting picture, we used to go marching on -- on holiday with -- carrying a Jew -- a -- an Israeli flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">As you could see, we here lined up for a march. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Now, I can’t quite tell you where we were going, but this is inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> , because you see the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">However, I know we went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">This could have been one of those Lach Baroma parades of sorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And here you have another picture of another picnic, specifically with my class and some of these people are still around and they’re very -- we’re very good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">This 1s a picture in the <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> , and here 1s a picture of the four of us, what I told you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  Okay, let’s go to the certificate, tell me a little bit more about the certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">You were a good student, I bet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  Yes, I was a very good student, and it makes me laugh that I came up with all excellents, and it didn’t really do me any good, because this was from a <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> , and I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">However, I kept it sort of as a souvenir, and as a matter of fact, this 1s only a copy because I donated the original the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">This was issued to me in January of 1947, when I was leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And of course, knowing that I -- I -- I would be going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but not knowing exactly what it is that I will need to present myself as a student, this was a handwritten kind of a report card, and it reads <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew public school</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Herzl</span> , [indecipherable] center, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> schlact -- March 23, 2001 Schlactensee. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And of course it has my birth date and where I was born and then all the subjects that were covered, and a --
QUESTION:  Could you say that again? </span><span class="sentence" id="223">All the subjects -- could you read some of those things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  Oh sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Behavior was number one, and it says excellent. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Now there -- there’s something very academic. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Bible, yes, Hebrew language, Hebrew literature, English language -- of which there was absolutely the most minimal amount because the professor -- the teacher was a -- a -- a British -- he was from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and the phrases that he taught us were laughable. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">One of those phrases to this day is -- his favorite phrase we have -- had to memorize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was situated on the <span class="DLF">cliff</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And I never forgot it because whenever I wanted to use a phrase in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , that was exactly the phrase I would need, obviously, to survive in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So to this day I have it ingrained in my brain. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">It’s -- it’s -- and I use it as an anecdotal joke, because that’s really what it amounts to. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Well, anyhow, the other is Hebrew history, Palestine geography, geography -- general geography. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Mathematics, algebra, geometry, physics, botanics -- which was botany. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Drawing, music, and physical training. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Now the music wasn’t much 1n the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> itself, but what we did was we used to go -- you know, we were in -- th-the German theater was brought back right after the war, in <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">We were on -- in the <span class="REGION">American sector</span> , however, somehow or other we had- th-the older kids in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> were able to go as a class, to go to, let’s say, we saw Schiller, the [indecipherable], I saw that in -- in <span class="BUILDING">Berlin theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">We were able to go to March 23, 2001 opera so that -- apparently I really don’t remember, but I do think that after a musical event, after mu -- an event -- cultural event that involved music, we probably discussed it in the class, because there was no musical instruction as such. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">But this was all terribly worthwhile, because really, that was basically connecting e -- connecting us to real -- th-the real world. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And I -- I surely am thrilled that I was able to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And now the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> grew in size, because when I first came, the -- the group was rather small, and I have a picture of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So was a very small group, but by the time I was ready to leave, which was early 1947, the -- I have another picture, as you could see, this is the- the -- the group grew, because as I mentioned before, people were coming out of the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> and trying to go westward. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And a lot of them, including my friend Tunia, stopped in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlactensee camp</span> so that these were -- not all of these kids that you see in the picture are not all camp survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Some of them are children who came out of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , which to an extent was also very bad, but that’s another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And of course, you know, there were weddings. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">People were getting married. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I have a picture of somebody’s wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I don’t know whose wedding, but I can s -- I could see that I’m here, and I could see there are flowers, and I could see that two big -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
ANSWER:  -- And of course, you know, there were weddings. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">People were getting married. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I have a picture of somebody’s wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I don’t know whose wedding, but I can s -- I March 23, 2001 could see that I’m here, and I could see there are flowers, and I could see that two big lo -- two long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> with a lot of people, and I si -- distinctly remember that somebody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was getting married and I wa -- am in it, and don’t ask me why. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">But I do see my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends, so perhaps -- you see, these are all my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Perhaps we were invited for whatever reason, but I can’t tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Well, moving along in the album, you could see this 1s our picture on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , coming over to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> on February 11", 1947, and I traveled with my sister and brother-in-law, Miles Lerman and Chris Lerman, and because one of my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends, George Schwab was also going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> with his mother, Clara Schwab, wis -- we stayed together. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was called Marine Perch, it was an old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport tran</span> -- converted <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And it was primitive by any standard, but to us it was luxury. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">The only thing is because it was February, we had a really terrific storm, and what happened was that everybody was very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Of course, women were separated from the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Chrisha, Chris, and Mrs. Schwab, Clara Schwab had to sleep with the women in the bowels of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I was privileged because I was a child, so I was put up with the children in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cabins</span> up on top, which is sort of like first class, but it wasn’t, there was a -- two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , two tier <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> so I shared the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with three other girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Well, what happened was that both Chrisha and Mrs. Schwab were sick throughout the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> because they absolutely lived down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bowels</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , without the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I had the good fortune of not getting sick, so I was running around the March 23, 2001 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and of course there was food above and beyond the need of anybody, because nobody else was eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So I was eating, and I was running around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and I don’t think George was sick either, and there were a few of us youngsters running around. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I got such a terrific -- not a cold, but I -- I -- I developed laryngitis on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> f -- I guess of being -- running around or whatever, it was that when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> it took me about two months to get rid of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It’s true, I now just remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">But the voyage itself was, as I said, was eventful because we were stuck in the -- in the- in the storm, and it took us 13 days to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Atlantic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Now you could practically make two trips, but we were very lucky and knew it, and we were very happy to arrive here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  Did you mingle with other passengers? </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Did you get to know anybody else? </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Was there something strange on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that you didn’t know -- I mean, sort of anything that comes to mind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  No, basically, a-as I told you, most of the people that -- that were on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> were sick, including my sister and Mrs. Schwab. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">The youngsters, those of us who were around, just roamed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and went to eat, and went to eat again, and then went for snacks, because the -- the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> was open all the time, and we were asked to please come, there is so much food and nobody is eating. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So this is what we did, we ate our way through the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and the rest we did was run around and have a good time. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So that’s about all I can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I just know that finally when Chrisha March 23, 2001 emerged fro -- from the -- from her seasickness, she -- she absolutely -- was about a day before w-we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , was in the nick of time, and of course she recovered quickly, but she -- she was not one of those to -- to run around, she was laid up. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And here is my ship card.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  Hang on [indecipherable] s-say that again here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  And here is my ship card, which I also kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Actually, I don’t know that I kept it or did I just write for it? </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I could have just requested it and have it sent to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So it has all this family name and middle name and age and marital status -- status, nationality. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And then of course, it has an address, because we were sponsored by my brother-in- law’s family. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So, you had to have a sponsor in those days and the sponsor’s address had to be put on -- on -- on your I.D. papers so that you would not be a burden to the -- to the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And as I mentioned before, we did not go through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  Okay, I think --
ANSWER:  But -- yearbook, this is my yearbook. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">You see it’s signed by my -- this English teacher who was the head of the department. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">She signed it and everybody else signed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So where am I? </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Here. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Here I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">You see this -- you had to say what you were planning to do, and I said I was planning to be a social worker, so this is what I was really planning, but it didn’t work out that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And here 1s a -- well, I see I even have a clip in here from the Brooklyn Eagle, my God, this paper du -- doesn’t exist any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Dated February third, 1949, where it says at the end that I also got a scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">March 23, 2001 I was a scholarship winner upon graduating from Thomas Jefferson High School. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I forgot that I have this clipping in my yearbook. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And this was a lovely group. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">There were a group of us, of refugee children in that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and they were all -- I’m -- Iam very proud to say that mo -- all of these kids who came out of that refugee class went onto bigger things 1n life, and really -- really went -- are accomplished people, so it’s good to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">QUESTION:  What is -- what is soccer and football? </span><span class="sentence" id="301">What does that do? </span><span class="sentence" id="302">That’s --
ANSWER:  Oh, well --
QUESTION:  -- that’s for the boys, probably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  Yeah, that was all -- this was sports, you know, as every <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> had sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I was not in sports, because I had my own things to attend to. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I had part time jobs to go to after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I worked very hard to be a good student, but as I look through the pictures, I remember how many friends I had here. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I love those little inscriptions here and there, I just love that. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And I’m sorry to say that some signatures here mean nothing to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Edna Gordon, now who was she? </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But others were very b-best friends, so -- Madeline Gross.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">QUESTION:  Li -- like ha -- like who?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  Well, my very, very, very best friend from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , who 1s no longer alive, was S- Sonia Labeener. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And she’s the one I mentioned before, she was quite accomplished, and committed suicide at age 39, had -- she is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Shirley Labeener she was called, March 23, 2001 right. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And this is Sonia. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">We graduated together. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I met her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jefferson</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And then I met also Toby, and she, I think, graduated -- it’s Toby Weinstroff. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">No, Toby’s not here. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">You know, I haven’t looked at this book for a long time, and obviously I’ve forgotten a lot of faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">But I bet if I went through it, I would remember some of the names. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But that has to be put off for another time -- day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">QUESTION:  Now let’s do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">ANSWER:  While we’re on the subject of Thomas Jefferson High School, I have to show you something which is really ridiculous and laughable, but I -- I -- I mean, it’s -- it’s one of these peculiarities. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I happen to have here, a whole bunch of election buttons and my kid’s buttons as they grew up and all kinds of boxes and -- and -- and God knows what else, and among them I have my senior graduating button. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And I really must describe it because it is so funny 50 years hence. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">It says, senior 1949, <span class="BUILDING">TJHS</span> , Thomas <span class="BUILDING">Jefferson High School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It has a boy and a girl looking at each other inside a circle, sort of a smiley kind of faith -- face. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">The button is orange and the writing is blue because this was the -- those were the colors of my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Well anyhow, every senior was to wear this, and I did proudly, right through the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And I kept that button. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Now I’m sure that this probably sounds awfully childish and all that, but I think this is the most precious thing, and I keep it and I am not going to part with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So back it goes, into the box with the buttons. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">If you allow me, [Il just look through this bunch of buttons, I have this whole bag here, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I don’t even really know what is here, March 23, 2001 except that I dumped them all in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> so that they wouldn’t be scattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Now, let’s see what I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I have my senior button from Thomas Jefferson High School, 1949, orange and blue, the ca -- colors of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , with two faces, boy and girl looking at each other, really charming. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Next I have the possessions of my kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">One of them is -- let me see, this is Bronx science senior, that would be 1973, that would be Harry. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Then I have a <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> -- Eleanor Roosevelt Junior High School, senior ’73, that would be Paul’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Then I have two buttons, and ov -- obviously they’re not mine, but they belong to some -- one of my kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">One is Mohammed Alli, it says heavyweight championship, Ali versus Wepner. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And then I have a big button of Chuck Wepner with a W -I-N, an acronym, but it says whatever it -- it’s supposed to spell win. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So that’s cute. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Then I have a Lieutenant school safety patrol, that was Paul’s si -- insignia when he carried the flag to the -- in his <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> for assembly. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And then of course I have a button of solidarity, a Polish button, says Solidarnosht with the flag, that became a very famous sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I think I received it -- no, no, not in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , even though I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I got it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , but I keep it, too, I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">But anyhow, so this is the story of the buttons and there is my Thomas Jefferson button right in the middle of it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Say the party [inaudible]. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">The interesting thing in Jefferson that happened that really moved me was that my Hebrew teacher, who was Dr. Horowitz, Edward Horowitz, who was also the head of the Hebrew department, decided to make a surprise party for me in his March 23, 2001 <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and to invite that whole Hebrew class -- this was a language class, basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And -- and that was to celebrate my birthday and that was in December. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I was not told about it, but I just said that Dr. Horowitz invited the class to -- just for the evening, and of course I went, and lo and behold, there was this whole class, there was a party, there was cake. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">We -- we cut the birth -- I cut the birthday cake and of course I had to make a speech, and I was very embarrassed, embarrassed beyond words. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And pictures were taken and -- and then Dr. Horowitz invited reporters to report. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And one of the reporters from the New York Post interviewed me and said, I understand that you have a number, a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> number -- because this party was -- was my 18" birthday and was supposed to be making up for what is called sweet 16 in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , which I didn’t have because I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">This reporter -- specifically this reporter from the Post came and said, “I understand that you have a number on your arm from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Could you please show us -- show it to us?” </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And I did and he said, “While you’re sitting here, could you kindly point with your other hand to your -- with your finger to the hand that bears the number so we have it in the picture?” </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And I really thought this was stupid, but I -- you know, I was too embarrassed to say it because here I was and -- and I didn’t think it was proper of me to -- to -- to say no when Dr. Horowitz arranged for the interviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So I have a picture in my album as you could see, the article with the picture where I’m sitting, pointing to the number on my arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And that appeared in the New York Post, which was the old New York Post, which March 23, 2001 was one -- sort of a liberal paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Aside from which I have here clippings from the Brooklyn Eagle, and I have two of those, one announcing the party and one after the party. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I have a -- an article from the Jewish paper, written in Yiddish, which I am ashamed to admit I cannot read. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And it’s from the Morning Journal, the yid -- Jewish paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Then there is one here from the Jewish Examiner, and another clipping from the <span class="BUILDING">Jefferson High School</span> school paper, which says, “Surprise party for Jeffersonian,” and they all deal with the party that Dr. Horowitz gave for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">QUESTION:  Could -- could you read a little bit of this, and then also could you say why -- sort of why -- why had you thought it was stupid? </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Elaborate on this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  Yes, well, it’s the -- the pictures has me sitting there pointing to my number. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And the -- the little bit of an article underneath says, “Regina Laks was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz concentration camp</span> when she became 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And sweet 16 parties weren’t held in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Now she’s 18, but as her fellow students said, there is no one in particular who could arrange a party for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So tonight her classmates in Dr. Edward Horowitz’s Hebrew course at Thomas Jefferson High School, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , will meet at Dr. Horowitz’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at 1334 Carrow Street, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , to toast her in soft drinks and to wish her enough happiness to erase the memory of years of suffering.” </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Now this was most touching and -- and I didn’t quite see the point of -- of pointing to my number. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">I wasn’t embarrassed about it, I just didn’t think it was necessary because I was really living a new life and that was an old story and I -- at that time people didn’t March 23, 2001 talk about the Holocaust in any way. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">Basically it was a -- it was a war that was over and finished and -- and -- and I felt the same way about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So anyhow I did it, and here it is to prove that I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">He -- he thought it was important, so maybe it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  You know, I just remembered something while we are talking about <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="382">In 1983 I took a course at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia University</span> that was given by Kashimirs Brandis, he’s a very famous Polish writer who left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> a-and he was a persona non grata, and was given a fellowship, or whatever and came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and lectured at -- h-he gave a course in Polish literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">The class was small, was twen -- 12 people or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I enjoyed every bit of it because the reading assigned was the kind of literature which I was not acquainted with. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Most works that were written during the war, or directly after the war, I would -- did not know the authors and I did not know the books, so that was a wonderful experience for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Anyhow, we got to feel so close to each other in that class, that when he was ready to leave -- to leave <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and the course was over, I proposed to the class that we ought to give Mr. Brandis a gift, a going away gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And what struck me about him was that he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> while he lectured at <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> , he lived in <span class="BUILDING">Columbia housing</span> and he would come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> carrying books in a shopping bag, paper shopping bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">So I always thought about that, but I never remarked, because I knew that people who ran away from March 23, 2001 <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> during communism weren’t exactly well-to-do -- well off. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">So I said to the people in the class that it will be very nice if we bought him a -- if we put -- got some money together and bought him a leather briefcase, so that that would really show that- for the person -- the kind of person that deserves it. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I went out and I priced it -- I think Crouch and Fitzgerald, one of these fine leather stores. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And I came back, I said, “You know, I have the a -- I know where to buy it and it’s beautiful, and we’ll do that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And I said, “You know, but before we do it, let me just call a friend in the Polish Institute who -- Kristen Auwisher, who is very friendly,” -- excuse me -- “with the wife, and just double check that this is the gift that he could really use.” </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Well, I called my friend and she called Mr. Brandis’s wife, and she called me back and she said, ‘Renia, under no circumstances should you buy this gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">It will be offensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">He’s going to look like an apparatchick. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">He needs to look like an academician who is being persecuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">A professor who is down on his luck because the communists are making life hard for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Don’t ever buy him a bri -- a leather briefcase, because he’ ll dump it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Well, I took it back to <span class="BUILDING">class</span> , we laughed ourselves silly, and then I told this Kristen Auwisher, I said, “Listen, you already told me what not to buy, now at least tell me what to buy, because I do have the money available for,” -- she says, “Well, you notice he wears one of those metal watches, Russian style, the horrible looking wrist watches.” </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I said, “Great, I already have the idea.” </span><span class="sentence" id="402">So I went to Tiffany’s and bought a beautiful gift, and here I have a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">We had a party. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">It happened to be March 23, 2001 May third, which is a Polish -- Polish holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So what happened is that we had a party in -- at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> , we requested a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and here I am handing him the gift, which was -- as you could see, there’s a Polish flag with the -- with the flowers, because this was third of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And here is where I’m handing -- handing him the gift, and he was absolutely thrilled with it, you could see he’s holding it. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">There was somebody’s child, one of the students brought their child to the party. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So this is Professor Brandis hone - holding the watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And I understand -- he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> after that, I understand that he still wore the watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">In fact, he just died about this year or maybe at the beg -- end of last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">So that’s another one of those funny anecdotes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">QUESTION:  Good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">ANSWER:  [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">So, before we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">After Thomas Jefferson High School, with the wonderful experience I had there, I went the -- to <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> -- [phone rings] -- I went to <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> and a lot of the refugee children from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jefferson</span> were -- went with me at the same time because we graduated together and that was a wonderful experience, but while I was at <span class="BUILDING">Brooklyn College</span> the first year, I was offered a teaching job at <span class="BUILDING">Indiana University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So I transferred to <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> , to continue my college education, but at the same time to teach Polish to an -- program of linguistics -- within the linguistics department that was organized for Air Force officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Those were classes that were taught --
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">March 23, 2001
ANSWER:  The course that I was teaching was a course in Polish, the language, and some of the customs, Polish customs. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Class was small, and all of the students were Air Force officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">There, I think were -- I really don’t remember, four or si -- no, six or eight, rather, and they were basically trained to be assigned to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as attachés and such. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Anyhow, it was a wonderful experience because it allowed me also to study while I taught. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I took a -- I continued my own academic program while I was teaching and I was so well received by the linguistics department that when I was ready to leave for -- to graduate, I received a very nice letter from Mr. Seebeac who was the head of the linguistics department and it said here, “I’m extremely sorry that your association with the Air Force language training program is coming to an end on November 13", 1952. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">This is to express my appreciation of your work, and to assure you that I know you have done a fine job. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Sincerely yours, Thomas A. Seebeac.” </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And -- and of course I graduated from <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> soon after, which was February, 1953. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And of course I only have most wonderful memories of <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> , so that’s a whole chapter, but I was thrilled when I graduated. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Victor came to the graduation, we were already engaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">So that was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">QUESTION:  Mm-hm?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">ANSWER:  Since we’re rummaging through the albums, I just came across this old album where I have some of Victor’s old pictures from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Here 1s -- here he is in his uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">He went to a <span class="BUILDING">private military school</span> up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ossinee</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Doesn’t he March 23, 2001 look spiffy here? </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Wow. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">All these buttons up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Isn’t that cute? </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And this I think is of his picture from <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Very sweet boy, he always was sweet guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I think this is his <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> picture -- graduation picture, and this is his college graduation picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  Say something about --
ANSWER:  And he --
QUESTION:  -- how -- how -- how he -- why you liked him [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Oh, I always liked him because he -- he -- first of all, he always had manners, and he’s very considerate and -- and very -- he’s quiet by nature, but very profound and very devoted, and of course he made only the best father on earth and the best husband, so I’m very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">That’s absolute fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And we’ve had a very good life together, because we -- we are very compatible, very compatible. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">We -- we differ by temperament quite a bit, because I am sort of fast, and -- and s -- you know, more impetuous. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Victor is slower and more deliberate, so it’s a very good balance. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And I think he’s had an excellent influence on me because he -- he really knew always how to calm -- how to calm me down. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">How to -- how to make me sort of, you know, slow down a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">And here it is, some of his pictures -- look, there were girlfriends here, I b - I bet he was all of 14 here. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">This 1s a cute picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">That’s one of these girlfriends that he had, let me see. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">This is Victor with whatever little dog or cat. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">These are cute. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">This is Victor’s family. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">That’s his oldest sister, Ruth, she’s passed on. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And that’s his March 23, 2001 younger sister, Clara, she’s gone, just died last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Here is Victor upon graduating from <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">He was -- this was -- no maybe -- that was just about -- before he went to the army, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So that’s a very good portrait picture of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">That’s his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Oh, here he -- here is very interesting picture, he was in the army as you know, during the Korean war, and he was a company clerk, so here he is in uniform, and doing a very good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Here he 1s giving blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I kept the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And here he is at his <span class="BUILDING">post headquarters</span> in a picture with the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> in the background. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I guess that was his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> somewhere there, and this is at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="465">He was always so reliable, he is always the most dependable person in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Always has been. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I mean, you can build a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> on what he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I guess this is why he had such an easy time of it in the -- 1-in the army job, because you know, when he was asked to do something, he did it, and it was to perfection. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">So, he’s still that way, and tha-that’s all -- all the best for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  Okay, and you --
ANSWER:  To bring you up to date about the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> , you recall that we talked about saving the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , preserving at least part of it, and we were successful, first in registering it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and then took a number of years, and it’s a whole story which I already told, we gathered the money together and the project was completed. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Now, I wanted to show you in my album, I have the pictures before and after. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Now, as it is, the project is now complete, the book about the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> is coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">In fact, I just mailed in an forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I wrote a little introduction to the book March 23, 2001 in English, which was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> because they are coordinating it. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So as you could see here, these were the pictures that Victor, my husband Victor took while we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to see what was happening there. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">It was a completely neglected area, and the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were built on the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> itself, because some of the tombstones were removed by the Germans for -- for <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> and otherwise they were destroyed, so that this was the situation where the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> was going to be obliterated completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Finally, after Paula Funk and I were able to register the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , it was declared as a- as a historic landmark and could not have any more <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> encroaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">End of Tape One, Side B March 23, 2001 Beginning Tape Two, Side A
ANSWER:  Finally, after Paula Funk and I were able to register the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , it was declared as a -- as a historic landmark and could not have any more <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> encroaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Eve- subsequently, the money that was given to the people who worked on it, accomplished the final job. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So as you could see, I -- these pictures were sent to me from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Here are the workers working on the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Here 1s what it looks like. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Apparently the -- the <span class="DLF">fence</span> -- <span class="DLF">metal fence</span> is beautiful, it was designed by an architect, and apparently it also has a fantastic, wonderful <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And inside -- this is the picture <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , where those tombstones which were beyond repair were collected, and were put together in -- in wa -- sort of like an artistic pile. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And this final picture shows that the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in the background are where they are, but no more <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> will be on the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and the fact is that we are paying for perpetual care, which not only preserved the si -- th-the location, but also preserves the esthetics, and the -- the grass will be cut, and everything will be kept up to date. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And here is my friend Janek Sneer from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , who was instrumental in arranging all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">He’s -- here he 1s in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">He had it all officially designated and -- and finalized with the <span class="BUILDING">mayor’s office</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">So, he send me these pictures and I am just so very, very pleased that we a- accomplished it. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">As you could see, it’s very attractive looking, and you could see there is a Polish sign, it says, <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And I can’t quite make out everything else, but there -- something in they -- I -- I can’t make out because the sign March 23, 2001 is sort of covered a little on the bottom, but this is the official designation. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And this is a historic landmark, so I am very pleased about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I’m looking forward to getting the book which Janek said th -- I -- everybody who contributed money will get when the book is ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Just to bring you up to date to events that happened that might be of interest between the last time I saw you and now. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Quite a number of years ago I translated, “The Shoemakers,” a play by Stanislaw Ignacy Witkiewicz, which was supposed to be pre-presented at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaMama</span> , they ran out of funds, so they only ended up with a reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">But the play has been around for a while, and it was presented at <span class="BUILDING">Wesleyan University</span> last spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">In fact, it was April 28", at <span class="BUILDING">Wesleyan</span> in my -- my translation of -- of the Witkiewicz -- Witkiewicz play, and Victor and I were invited, and it was just very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">We were introduced to the actors and they asked me about the background of Witkiewicz, the -- the -- the playwrights background, and of course, this is an avant-garde play, so it can be produced in different ways, but it really must be understood for what it is, because it was written 1 -- during the interwar period. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And witki -- Witkiewicz was an avant-garde playwright who didn’t quite fit the times yet, but he became the rage after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And I don’t mean in communist Poland, but in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , for example, and wherever else -- he was translated into other languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And he committed suicide by the way, in 1939, as the Russians were approaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">He was running east when the Germans entered <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and when he saw the Russians coming his way, he committed suicide on -- on <span class="DLF">road</span> east. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">But anyhow, his <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- of March 23, 2001 course, he was considered the lunatic type, but he was the most educated man and a great playwright, and great, fantastic painter of -- of modern art. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I have a number of -- of his books of -- of paintings. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Of course, he took every conceivable drug, peyote, and cocaine and all that, and he wrote and painted under the influence. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Aside from which, he was not in tune with anything that went on in the 30’s, during his productive years, so that he was an oddball, and everybody said he was crazy, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">But now, not only are si -- his paintings most valuable, but his work has come into its own, because now you can really see he -- for example, this play “Szewcy,” which is “Shoemakers,” really discusses the end of the world, sort of, you know, when the -- when the -- the -- the world is going to be taken over by the automatons, but of course this 1s supposed to be a comedy, but it isn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But it is really, truly a great piece of work, so I was very pleased when we were invited. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And it was so well produced, you know, I must tell you that I only think that professional, big professional company could do justice to Witkiewicz, because you must understand what he was talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Well, I was so impressed by the Wesleyan production, I truly cannot begin to tell you, not just the -- the way it was produced, and the way it was presented -- and these were actually students, they were -- they do have a -- a drama department, so these were students from the drama department. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">But how it was presented for what it is, in other words, it wasn’t cut, 1t wasn’t altered, it wasn’t anything, it was just pure Witkiewicz. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">It was fantastic and I loved it, so I was very happy to see that -- to see it, and -- and that was March 23, 2001 just a year ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Also for the -- onto the projects which I completed between the time I saw you last and now, I have translated in -- completed in 1998, a book translated from Polish into English, “Krakow Ghetto Diaries and Poems.” [</span><span class="sentence" id="514">recited title in Polish] written by Helena Melkin. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">That was one project and I -- of course I have it copyrighted, so I’m showing you the copyright form. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And second one was a book called, “Recollections of My Life as a Diplomat,” [recites title of book in Polish], written by Yandro Hoyofski, he was a Polish diplomat with an extremely complicated life because he was sort of politically involved from the time before the first war and through the 30’s and into the war years, and he was mixed in with the Polish government in exile in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , while at the same time he was more or less free to travel to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and -- and become a part of the later government, communist government, and ended up as an ambassador in <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span> , which of course was a plum job to -- given to people who deserve it. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So there is much controversy over that person. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">But I did it on consignment, and I -- I really learned quite a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I loved doing it because I learned all those interesting things 1n it, and that project was completed in °99, December of ’99. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">I think I mentioned to you that I worked on the Lédz ghetto book. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Actually it’s a book and a film that followed. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">This book contains many translations because it’s a -- it was compiled -- it was put together from different -- from writings by different people in different languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Namely, it was written in Polish, Yiddish, German, I think some French, and some material for the book was in March 23, 2001 Europe but it was brought to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , but other material was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So that you have some Polish that was done in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but most of the Polish for this book was done by me. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And of course the index by authors -- authors meaning the original authors of the writing, is at the end of the book on page 525. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And I have underlined here all these authors that I translated. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Ludwig Ashe, and I have all the num -- the -- the -- he was a poet. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I have all the poems that I translated, and Poznanski, Jakov Poznanski, now his work -- as you could see, I have a Xeroxed copy of the book, and he was a lawyer, a grown man of -- of some experience, life experience, and his is a very detailed, and very analytical description of the events in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz ghetto</span> , whereas the Sierakowiak, David Sierakowiak was a youngster of 16, a budding poet, and his work is all emotion, and all vibrant longing and of course pos -- Poznanski, the older man survived, but Sierakowiak died of hunger in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz ghetto</span> , but his diary was saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Anyhow, I translated Sierakowiak’s diary, and Poznanski’s work, which those two books comprise the biggest part of the Polish translation and that’s my work, plus I -- you must have heard the name Rumkowski? </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Yes, well Rumkowski’s speeches were given in Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">You know, he was to -- h-he was one of these men who always gave speeches because he -- he had to lecture people on what you do and what you don’t do, and you can’t rebel because I do everything for your own good, and you’re going to do what I tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Well, anyhow, those speeches were written in engl -- in y - in Yiddish, and they were transcribed into Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">So, I did the translations from the March 23, 2001 Polish -- the Polish transcripts, and did quite a number of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">So in this book when you find Poznanski and Sierakowiak, that’s my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">That’s the major work. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Quite a number of Rumkowski and the poems of Ashe. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And I’m very proud of it, and of course there was a | -- a -- a film based on the same book. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And -- oh, I just wanted to show you this play that I translated a number of years ago, probably about 10 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">It’s called “Assassination,” by Johanna Beeler Brudick. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And this was -- the original title was “Zamac.” </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And -- and it’s a sort of small kind of a play. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">The author lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , she never had it produced because she doesn’t have the means to pursue it, but it was done on the radio a few times, and some readings of it were done, and I’m in contact with her, so she was very pleased about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">But that was among my early projects, and this was -- of course it’s a small play, it really didn’t involve as much time as for example, the Lédz ghetto project, or the books which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And so I was done with it, and I have other projects here too, that since I was do -- I do freelance work, so you know I have -- I see I have a chapter here on the gypsies, or three chapters on gypsies, it was send in f -- to me to translate by this Polish writer Fitzowski, who is an expert on gypsy life in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And all this commercial work, and frankly [ll tell you, legally I have to keep official translations for no more than five years, so -- I mean, I can’t live with all that paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I probably would have to move out and just use the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for storing paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So I only save the very important projects, March 23, 2001 and the other, smaller projects just -- after five, six years, I have a very good excuse to go through it and dump it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">ANSWER:  Well, we can’t finish the interview without my bragging about the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So I just turned to a album here. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Here are the two boys, I think this was taken in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> at my sister’s <span class="BUILDING">summer home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muskoka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And here they are showing off the fish they just caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Of course they were always very outdoorsy kids because they belonged to the boy scouts and they both are Eagle Scouts, so this is the great trophy, as you could see in the picture, the -- the -- the fish is the greatest trophy of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And I do have some very lovely pictures somewhere else here, which were taken during the kid’s code of honor, Eagle Scout events. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Oh, here is one, here is one, I just found it. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Here is Harry becoming an Eagle Scout, and an article in the local paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And here you are with us, Victor, myself and the two boys in the boy scout uniforms with all the insignia, and the -- the -- the merit badges. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And of course I gave a big party in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , right here, with a big sign, congratulations. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Had a very lovely, big group of people in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And I did the same for Paul, obviously, I have it somewhere else here, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And you could see -- I don’t quite know where, but we did exactly -- whatever we did for Harry, the older son, we always did for Paul. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">So if it was one Eagle Scout party, it was a second Eagle Scout party. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">In two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Having shown off the young -- young boy -- girl, boys, I have to show the bi -- the big ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">A-A-As I mentioned, they’re March 23, 2001 grown men now, and Harry, the older one has two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">One of them 1s Max, and I have a picture here of him, with -- in the hockey uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Of course he -- he belongs to a team, what else, and he plays in Chelsea Pierce, and -- and absolutely this is his -- his biggest thing in life is hockey. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">He has all the equipment, obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And he also, I think, plays football, I think, or basketball. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I don’t really know, but I know that they take him to these -- to these -- in the Central Park teams, and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I really am not part of that because I can’t stand in the cold and watch them, or go to Chelsea Pierce at six o’clock in the mornings. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">That’s where they go, believe it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">They get up at five to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chelsea Pierce</span> at six, because that’s where the team plays. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Six a.m. ona Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Poor Harry. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Anyhow, this is the younger -- the younger of the two boys, and his name is Joseph, and he is sweetheart, you could see the lovely -- he speaks very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">He has such lovely vocabulary and grammatically correct at age three. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Long sentences, and very, very interesting boy, and full of cheer. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">You know, one of these children who are very, very sunny. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Sunny, warm type. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Well, that’s this child. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Now, as I told you -- when you came in I had to show off the picture, we have a new picture of Paul with his bride, Paul got married, and he married the Jan Jay, and Jan has a little girl from a previous marriage, her name is Caitlyn. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And now they have their own child. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So here is Caitlyn in a big picture which she send me not long ago, and here is the new baby that they have. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And a baby boy, and his name is David. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Middle initial -- middle name Victor. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And of course we haven’t seen him yet, because you know, I March 23, 2001 broke my shoulder. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I fell and broke my shoulder, so we couldn’t go to the bris, but they’re coming for the Passover holidays with the baby, so we’re looking forward to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  A lot of -- a lot of people, especially Holocaust survivors actually had a very strong response to what happened in the 50’s in the so called McCarthy era. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Could you just say a little bit -- something about your impressions from that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">ANSWER:  Well, I was more or less getting used to the idea that American democracy was really based on different opinions and different actions of people, that nothing was getting resolved in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> the way things were resolved in the political system that I grew up in, where you went to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for this, and -- and you did some other political misdeed, and -- and you -- you had to pay for that, because you had to toe the -- the -- the government approach to -- to -- to -- to -- to ruling, so to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Now, having been a child in the interwar period, I wasn’t quite aware of all the things that did go on, and I know a lot did, because I do know that there was a famous <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Bereza Kartuska</span> , where people who were communists were being sent, because apparently there was some ferment in the Polish society in the interwar periods -- period. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Well, I -- 1 knew <span class="BUILDING">Bereza Kartuska</span> and I knew people were sent there, but I never made the connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">When I finally lived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and realized what a fantastic system of government democracy is, allowing for freedom of expression and freedom of the press, and -- and -- and total freedom that you didn’t have to account to March 23, 2001 anybody for where you going or what you are doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">That all of a sudden -- and now I was already after <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and I -- having studied political science and such, I had the idea of what American democracy was about. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">But I really never saw the other side of the coin, where certain excesses that are committed in the society cannot be solved the way they were solved in Europe, the way I understood it, by simply acting on it right then and there, because this is a country of law, and everything has to percolate through the legal system. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">McCarthy’s excesses were so obvious to everybody, even to people who did not think that there was a communist under every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , spying, and that every liberal in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was a communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">There were people who had leftist leanings and didn’t act on them, but that was just their philosophy of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">There were -- I’m sure there were spies, as there always are, and I’m sure there were people who were organizing in leftist groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">But when the McCarthy era came and I realized that it had to take its course, to go through the leg -- legal system. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And to me it was entirely too long, and it really got me very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Eventually, of course, it was solved and I was very happy to see that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">QUESTION:  Now, there was another era when you got a little upset, or even a little more upset, and that was in the -- in the 60’s, there was the -- the counter-culture movement, or the 60’s revolution, or whatever you want to call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Speak a little bit about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  Well, I was upset about it on -- actually on two counts. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">But they are quite -- the -- the -- the issue really is a single issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">The 60’s counter-culture, in my eyes then, and March 23, 2001 in my eyes now, and this is 40 years later, were an inexcusable outburst that was allowed to permeate the cultural fabric in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Revolution of young people is quite fine, but once it -- once it 1s accepted into the culture, without the analysis of what consequences that might bring, was terribly upsetting to me, and of course my chil -- the children were by then young, and I was very much afraid that they would be growing into an -- a society that was culturally in anarchy. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">This government is a government of law, and we have a Constitution to preserve our legal rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">But culture is something that is not legislated, and once you tear it apart, you might not be able to put the genie back in the bottle. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And of course, I had growing -- children that were young at that time, whatever, they were in <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> and <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> , very impressionable age, and I really didn’t like this whole idea of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woodstock</span> , for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woodstock</span> becoming so prominent and so written up and photographed, and -- and televised, and repeated. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I mean, that was excess beyond excess. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">This was a bunch of young kids who went completely wild. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">That guy -- they got rid of their parents at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and everybody went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Woodstock</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">People could afford now to disregard the parents, because after all, I mean, you didn’t have to work so hard for a living any more, this was a year of -- of -- of prosperity in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">This could not have happened in the 30’s in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , during the depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">That absolutely could not have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So this to it -- it had to take its course. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And it took a long time because it couldn’t be legislated away, and it could not be waved away as -- as if it March 23, 2001 didn’t exist, because it did exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But of course, all these kids who eventually decided to get done with what 1s called the American culture, and the American form of government ended up in communes, or they ended up in -- in the biggest corporations in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">QUESTION:  D-Do you think that your feelings about that had in any way, something, also to do with where you came from, with your experiences?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">ANSWER:  Oh, it certainly did. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">No, because you see, I -- I ha -- I am always of the opinion, have always been, as a child, as a grown-up, that there have to be -- there has to be a certain framework for society to operate within. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">All the excesses that do nothing to enhance people’s life, to me do not -- do not do anything to either elevate the spirit or to elevate the mind, or to improve somebody’s economic conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I mean, if you have a -- an idea, at least the idea should benefit somebody or something, or should build something, but to destroy it and leave it destroyed, 1s totally against my -- my understanding of life, because I have seen what happens when you are simply allowing something to happen, and everything in the process gets destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Of course, the Holocaust is a much bigger issue, mi -- a million times over bigger. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">But the fact is that if you allow books to be burned, and the next step you allow people to be burned, 1-1-1- 1 -- it almost -- 1t almost makes you think that if such excesses, that grow out of not any specific need, but the desire to rebel for rebellion’s sake is totally wrong because it does nothing to improve anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And of course now it’s -- it’s quite obvious that this March 23, 2001 was what the -- the -- this was one period in American life that as the years go on, will show to be not such a happy chapter. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">It really was not a happy chapter. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I -- I felt terribly disturbed in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I’ve calmed down about it now, because I’ve seen some of these -- these rebellious kids grow into very decent people, but I know that the aftermath of the 60’s 1s still with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I mean, absolutely, all this permissiveness, and all that -- that followed from it still is around us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">QUESTION:  If you could try to say it as shortly as you ca -- as briefly -- sort of, in a capsule as you can, you did not become a social worker --
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">QUESTION:  -- although that was on your -- well, and that had to do with a certain prevailing understanding at the time of what social work was supposed to be, and your being against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Could you kind of sum that up a little bit, please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="637">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Well, you know, originally I really wanted to do social work. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I really, truly did. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">For many reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">One of the -- one of them being the fact that I did go through the Holocaust and had I not been helped as a child, I really wouldn’t have survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And I really felt I owed this goodness to other people, and I ought to reciprocate. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">However, by the time I came out of <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , with an idea of going to -- to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> for social work, the system changed, and I did not like the way the system was oriented, toward taking away the responsibility of the people to -- to -- to shift for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Rather than helping them be on their own feet, this was a system March 23, 2001 now that was going to provide and provide and provide. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And it ended up that they brought up -- this system brought up two or three generations of dependents who lived off the state, that their lives are ruined because they have no responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">They have absolutely no skill to be in the real world. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">So, basically what I feared had to -- came true, and -- and -- and now I think the lesson has been learned and -- and things are quite different. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">But in the -- at the time, at the very time when I was ready for social work, I realized that I -- that was not the <span class="DLF">field</span> for me any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I think I -- now I could go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">I think I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Of course I am too old now to go looking for a job, nobody would want me. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">But the thing is that at the present stage, I think I could fit better into the new framework than in the 50’s and 60’s -- especially in the 60’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B
QUESTION:  Let’s see, there was one question that just came to mind [indecipherable]
