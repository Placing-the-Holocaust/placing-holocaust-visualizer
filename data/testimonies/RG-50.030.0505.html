<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  Their Jewish holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Back then you felt it’s theirs and not yours?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  Because in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we didn’t celebrate it, we especially. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So I felt it more tha -- as the -- a-as the tradition of my grandparents, which was very nice and respected. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">But I had also in my childhood a Christmas tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Because ma -- not because it was for relig -- religious purposes, that my parents was -- were saying that you can take from other people the best they have, and they wouldn’t like me to be envious of other children who have this tree and get their different presents. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">So I had also a Christmas tree and our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was very international. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We had very many guests, Lithuanians and Russians and -- from all over the world, friends who would come and visit us. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So my parents spoke already -- except English probably, all European languages, French, German, Polish, Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So -- no, my -- my parents told me that you have always to speak the language that everybody understands, if you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So I was multilingual from childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I was speaking from my -- my native languages were two, Lithuanian, and Russian, I spoke from childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And then when I was five years old I had something with my lungs and I was sent to S-Switzerland, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arosa</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">sanitorium</span> , where I stayed for almost a year, and then I forgot all languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I came back not speaking Lithuanian and not speaking Russian, but speaking only German. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And I remember that I went with my parents to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , my father had his family there and m-my uncle made me a present, such a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> , a children’s sewing machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And it 1s in Russian shvaina mashina. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So I was told that -- that -- then the joke was that I answered the [speaks Russian here], I don’t want a big mach-machine, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So this only proves that I really didn’t speak any more Russian, but of course the languages came back very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And when I was sent to the Shalom Aleichem gymnasium, to the <span class="BUILDING">yeshida school</span> <span class="BUILDING">Shalom Aleichem gymnasium</span> , to the yeshida school, I didn’t speak Yiddish, but I learned it quite fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And I -- but the -- the beginning was not so good because I didn’t speak so well Yiddish, so my classmates would call me the intelligentka. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  No, I didn't feel because I mentioned already that it was a left wing school, really a very good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I remember my -- my -- my teachers, most of the teachers with great respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And my -- I must say that, for instance, my Lithuanian, I am really literate in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuanian</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I write in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuanian</span> well, and I learned -- I spoke from childhood, but I learned really the language and the writing in this <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Bu -- and my -- my teacher was [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">She perished in the Holocaust, and she came from a Lithuanian province and she was -- she finished the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> <span class="REGION">Lithuanian province</span> and she was -- she finished the university, Lithuanian language and literature, and she was really a wonderful teacher.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="360">QUESTION:  Low grade.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">QUESTION:  Yes, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Did you see them? </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Those Jews who went out and th -- you didn’t --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, no, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  -- you didn’t go there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  No, I didn’t go there, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">But you see, this is a very complicated question, this Jewish and Lithuanian reaction to those times, because it was quite clear after, that we are trapped between two super powers. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And it is also absolutely obvious, and it couldn’t be different, that for Lithuanians, maybe still the ger -- e-e-especially after the deportation, that for the Lithuanians still, the Germans are better, and for the Jews are still the Soviets better. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And I learned now recently, I was calling our institute of resistance on genocide, and I ask them how many people were deported, and how many people came back from <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So I was told that in ’41, the last information is 17,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">After the war it was hundred -- about 130,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">So -- including the Jews, who were also deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So, as a whole, about 150,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">Now, from the people who were deported in 1941, only about 20 percent came back, but from the people -- but these are so not very precise figures. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And fa -- from the people who were deported in -- after the war, until ’51 or ’50 -- I don’t know how long, think un-until ’51, or maybe *53, I don’t remember now exactly, the deportation -- 70 percent came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">From the Holocaust very few people came back, so it was still even better in -- in the -- for -- for Jews it’s a paradox, but in some way they were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And for instance our -- such a Jewish writer, Josade, he saved his parents from deportation and he could -- he suffered his whole life. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Actually, you made a film about him, he suffered his whole life, that he really killed his parents because he saved them from the Soviet deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">They got killed in -- in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So it 1s -- yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">But, also among the Lithuanian, I would say, intellige -- intelligentsia, among the loudeninke, this was the m-m -- the Volksparte1, the -- no, they were not socialists, but close to socialists. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So they were thinking, what’s better, the Germans or the Soviets? </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And they decided better the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Because under <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , under the German governance, for instance, <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">No -- no -- no traces of <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And under the Tsarist time, which was 200 years, we not only didn’t disappear, but we developed our, in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , the resistance movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">The -- the -- re-revival of the nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">So, that e -- we will -- we will be able to resist the Russian -- the Russian -- the -- the Soviet, and better not to deal with the -- with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Then also, some people, they’re fascinated, like for instance, Paletskis, or -- or Vanslovar, or Kemontite or Gregorouskas, or other people, they were fascinated by the official [indecipherable], and they thought that even if we join the Soviet Union, we will still stay a Lithuanian republic, and we will have our national culture and rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So it was, you know -- but after the deportations, then of course, the -- the Wehrmacht, the German army was met by Lithuanians with flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">So -- but that’s also understandable, because it was like saving from the deportation to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Was a very complicated situation, and is very interesting that in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> -- you know the story with the [indecipherable] where Poles killed, not- not -- not Nazis, but Poles killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">So it is also in the <span class="REGION">region</span> where the Soviets were before, where the deportations took place, and so on, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Then there is also another such moment, which can’t be forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Of course in -- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , the Jews had cultural autonomy and -- autonomy and so on, but it was not such an absolutely equal situation for everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Jews couldn’t take government positions, high up positions in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">They served in the army, but not on high -- or very few of them became officers and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And they didn’t feel like equal citizens of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , but the in -- the independence times was only 20 years, that’s a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And when the Soviets came, so they declared that everybody’s equal, and quite a few Jews got into the administration, got into, you know, official positions. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I -- I -- sorry -- and -- and it was like an illusion that now we are equal. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">But this was absolutely illusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And i -- and I must say ma -- but I came now -- come now a little bit back, my uncle, the brother of my mother, Jorge Stromas is -- was a very, very educated person, he got his education in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and he came back and he had an official position in the -- in -- in the Ministry of Finance, and was very, of course, helpful, but then he had to leave it, because he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">So, you see, he was still a -- a very much -- he was a [indecipherable] because he lacked very much the language and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">But- but still, he was not completely equal, even such a person as he, who was a -- so, it was very complicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I don’t know if I expressed myself clearly now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">QUESTION:  You did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  You did. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Certainly you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">So, did you feel that the war is almost s-starting at a certa -- certain point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  The -- th-the danger, the feeling of danger was present all the time, and of course everybody was shocked with the Soviet German pact, with the Nazi pa -- you know -- not --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Ribbentrop-Molotov --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  -- oh, Ribbentrop-Molotov pact.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="413">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">ANSWER:  And in -- in the Soviet Union people who would say something against Hitler were arrested, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So it was a quite -- quite confusing situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">But of course, you know, people are optimistic and -- and still the war came unexpected, the bombing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  It came unexpected for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  F-For me, of course.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="467">QUESTION:  To watch your mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="468">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And then m -- I left, and I -- on Friday I came back and I brought her clothes and she was already sitting at the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and the BaltaraiStininkas was probably flirting with the nurses, I don’t know, maybe, but he wasn’t there, so I could get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And this was my last time I saw my mother, and she was 35 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And we had the last talk, and I remember that my mother gave me some, like, three commandments. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And I can -- until now I can’t believe what kind of personality she was that she could speak about such things in such circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Of course, she had the hope that it is a mistake and --- and that everything will be okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">But she told me that -- try always to live according to your possibilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Don’t ask for more. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Be s -- be independent and self-sufficient. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And she also meant that if I need now money I can sell something of her jewelry or something of our belongings that I shouldn’t go and ask grandparents, or aunts or uncles or somebody else for help. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">Then the second commandment was I should always live with truth, because a lie doesn’t help. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And the third, which is maybe the dearest to me and probably saved me in some way, I should never take revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So -- and she of course told me where to go and maybe to look for help, that she should be released. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So I left her, and of course I started to -- to try to -- to liberate her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  Ho-How did you interpret the situation that your mother is giving you this kind of advice, these commands, this --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I am until now interpreting it. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I think she was just a wonderful person and she believed in some very important common values she wanted me to follow.</span></p>

<p>ANSWER:  No, I was not surprised, I was -- I had -- I was surprised later on, and then I was just listening and remembering, and I was 13 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">It was such a situation, you can’t imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I was -- I was not reflecting then, I was only thinking what to do, how to save my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So -- and -- and I went to -- to such a person, Skuropskas is his name, he was working, he was a tow toninkas, he belonged to the national party and my mother helped him to escape the -- to save him from deportation, because in some way she -- she told him that he’s in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And -- and when I came, he was already the -- the minister and the -- he was sitting in the -- ond -- in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the [indecipherable] was sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And -- and he told me -- I's -- told him that my mother is arrested, could he help? </span><span class="sentence" id="491">He knows her, he knows that she was not NK VD and she was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">She was even not a party member, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">So he said there were hidden and there were open communists and NK VDist. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So he didn’t help at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">He had already high position, but it didn’t last for long. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And then I went to Pulkininkas Bobelis who was a neighbor of ours. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">We lived together before we -- we -- m-my father built his own <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of Laisves Aleja, at the beginning of <span class="BUILDING">Laisves Aleja</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">It was I think first, or number one, and -- <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And he was a very, very polite and very charming Colonel Bobelis, and he came to s -- play cards with my mother and I was friendly with his daughter Laimuta, who was my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">The -- she had two brothers, Kazys Bobelis and they are -- ah, no, sh-she had two brothers, Jurgis [indecipherable] is why, the sons of Bobelis. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">But they were older and they were already very active in this movement of liberation, and Bobelis became the commandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And I must say I had a very bad experience with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">I went to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he promised to help and asked me that -- he said -- told me that I have to bribe -- he has to bribe people so I should bring some -- some -- some --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  [indecipherable] End of Tape One Beginning Tape Two</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Okay, so you were running --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I was running away and of course my grandparents didn’t allowed me any more to go to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">But I must also say that I learned from Sara Ganita that he helped her family, Bobelis, and I also- he released my aunt, the wife of stro -- o-of Jorge Stromas, who got arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And when he got to know that she is there, he told to let her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So -- but my experience with him was really not very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And -- and it’s painful for me, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">So I couldn’t help my mother, and I was -- she was taken on Sunday to the pri -- to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mizkavajoes</span> , to the main <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="632">ANSWER:  No, not everybody did it, you know, I would say the whole atmosphere was bad, but not everybody did it, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Many people were ashamed to do it, it -- it is like, you know, when you say that the Jews were meeting with joi -- the Red army. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">So, there were some Jews who did it, some were terrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">But -- so the same 1s to say that Lithuanians, some yes, but not all. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And then you see the propaganda, the -- the Nazi propaganda, which was taken also over by the LAF-ists, the Lithuanian LAF-ist Skirpa, who had a good intention to -- to have again an independent <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , he thought that maybe Hitler will give him back the independence, but it didn’t happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">It was a big disappointment, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">But I know that you can’t use any -- you have, you know, this M-Machiavelli, that 1-1f you have a task you can pay any price, this is not valuable in life, it is terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">So -- and it was, the propaganda was, you see, you are of -- all Jews are communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">It stays very deep in your -- in your con -- in the Lithuanian conscience that -- that they sold you to the Soviet Union, they are your real enemies and therefore you have to kill them like parasites. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So you -- and I am absolutely sure that many Lithuanians really took revenge for their deported -- and it could happen that for instance, when their family or somebody was deported, some -- some of the people who came to deport was -- could be also a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">There were not many of them, but still, 1t could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">This is why th -- you should never generalize. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">So it was like absolute belief that the Jews are your enemies, that the Jews are communists, the Jews sold your cu -- sold your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and there were maybe people who believed that they are killing the enemies. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And only later it came -- of course there were people among the killers who wanted to become richer, who wanted the -- there were different people. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">It’s complicated, but 1-in the beginning it was really that. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And it’s very interesting, one lawyer from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Solvakia</span> , he told me how, after the beginning of the war, the Jews, I think it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">VilkaviSkis</span> , they were collected and brought into the <span class="BUILDING">kazaram</span> , you know, where the -- the -- the -- the soldiers live. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And everybody was asked who he 1s and -- and they wanted to get from them, I don’t know, the men -- men, maybe men. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And then one Jew was somehow -- wasn’t obedient, and they shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And they were so afraid that they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And they have hidden him in -- in somewhere, buried him in a secret <span class="NPIP">place</span> , because they were afraid that tomorrow will come a [indecipherable] and will accuse them that they killed a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">But nothing happened, nobody came. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">So it was absolute free. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">You could kill a Jew, you could kill him like a fly. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Nothing would happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">So -- and then it 1s e -- it -- it -- 1t -- it comes like a -- I don’t know, it was a terrible atmosphere of hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">You can’t -- it’s described in literature, it 1s -- it doesn’t last for very long, but it 1s there and they have to pay a very high price for that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="669">ANSWER:  I remember that we got a -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coach</span> with a horse and I put some clothes in, and food, mainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And some -- what you had what could be maybe sold later on, or something, but --</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1428">ANSWER:  You see, it is a very hard issue, and very unpleasant issue, and you have here to differentiate many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">First of all you should know that in the Soviet times, nothing was really mentioned, and the Holocaust, if it was mentioned, was used mainly only for anti-Fascist propaganda. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">And you couldn’t even use the word Jew, it was only Soviet citizens and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">You know that the Soviets destroyed finally the big <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">They destroyed the famous <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">I don’t know if you have seen the -- the last pictures of that, it is really an -- and -- and they build <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and -- and ste -- and -- and <span class="DLF">steps</span> and so on out of this -- of these stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">So there was nothing, really, and th-the Jewish life didn’t exist as such, almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">Only maybe for some propaganda. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">And -- and when we became independent and even before the independence, when the Lithuanian revival started, cultural revival and -- and the -- and so on, then also started the Jewish revival and my colleague, Professor Kudaba, here is his picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">An absolute outstanding person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">He was the organizer of the Lithuanian Cultural Society, and then, thanks to him all the minorities also organized their cultural societies and the Jewish Cultural Society was organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">And for the first time all the questions came up about the past and -- and about the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">So -- so m -- th-th-this -- th-the situation was really m -- very complicated, complex, and you can understand that a nation who 1s, after being suppressed and occupied for so many years is regaining its independence and want to establish itself in the normal democratic world, it’s not very pleasant to talk about participation in the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">Also, I must say that it was not very -- it was still, I must say the -- the stereotypes of the -- of the 40’s and 50’s were still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">That the Jews are traitors, that Jews were communists and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">So I must say that anti- Semitism and the readiness to face the Holocaust was not a -- a simple question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">But I must say that on the official level, our government, and especially I would say Vytautas Landsbergis took all the really decent steps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">First of all, the genocide was condemned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">The -- one of the first -- it was -- and it has no -- it -- the people who took part in -- in this genocide can’t be -- can’t be [speaks Lithuanian here] I don’t know how to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">They -- they have ever to be, always to be condemned, it doesn’t depend how much time passed away past then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">The -- one of the first things the government did was to replace the stones in the -- on the steps of tower of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> , to take all these cemetery stones, gravestones away and put the o -- the other ones, not to go on those [indecipherable] th-the 23" of September, which was the day of the liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius ghetto</span> was announced as the day of genocide, and it was an order to -- to put out all the flags, Lithuanian national flags with -- with a black --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  [indecipherable] ribbon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1449">ANSWER:  -- ribbon, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">The Jewish cultur -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was recreated and -- and supported. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">They cemeteries were looked after and m -- I am very proud that my former student, Vito Tostalakis was the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">He was a teacher then, he took his -- his pupils and they went to clean up a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> not far away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilnius</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">And <span class="NPIP">killing places</span> were also, bit by bit, together with the Jewish community, they were cleaned and looked after. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">And of course, Jews got all the rights ar -- citizens and Lithuanians have absolutely equal rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">That --that’s absolutely a matter of fact that I would say that maybe a little bit weaker was the question of conde -- of the trials, you know, this Lileikis and so on, but I must still say that on the official level, everything was -- was quite okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">And m -- on the academic level, the breakthrough started pro-probably from 795, something, ’96. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">And I look -- came up and there were, especially our young historians, of middle age historians were ready to face the truth and -- and more and more information came up about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">So I th -- and now we have really already a changed situation on the level of the [indecipherable] intellectuals and with -- and not only a civil society is now really a lot participating already in -- in facing this question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">You know that Lithuanian in-intelligentsia created the house of memory, which is working 1n this direction and -- and they -- they announced already four times a competition, who were the Jewish neighbors -- for <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1460">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1461">ANSWER:  Who were the Jewish neighbors of my grand and grand-grand parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">So the children are coming out through all <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , to the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> and finding out who lived here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">And so they go back to history [indecipherable] and -- and learning from -- from this terrible history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">And I must say that we made now about 700 <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> -- 700 teachers are working with the Holoto-caust topics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">Holocaust is told in the military s -- <span class="BUILDING">academy</span> , and in <span class="BUILDING">military schools</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">military academy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">A lot 1 -- we have a lot of <span class="BUILDING">educational centers</span> who are dealing with that -- with that issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">And really hundred, hundred of <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and pupils. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">We have now, you know, that Adamkus created the commission to investigate crimes of Nazi times and gu -- Nazi crimes and the gulag. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">And we have their commission which also published and found out a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">I must say that our <span class="BUILDING">genocide center</span> , which was first of all like dealing only with the anti-Soviet movement is now more and more facing also the Holocaust situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">So I would say that on the academic level it is -- and such educational level, there is already a breakthrough and a dialog. </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">A lot is really done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">I must also say that when Respublika, for instance, published the article of the chief editor of the newspaper, a terrible article, “Who rules the world?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">And the answer was the Jews and the gays. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">You heard, probably, about this article. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">So what -- not everybody remembers, but you should remember that the first protest was done by the Lithuanian NGOs, Lithuanian organizations and Lithuanian individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">And during two days, this protest against Tomkus’s writing was signed by about a hundred organizations, about a hundred individual peoples and much more would sign it if it would -- we would keep -- not me, we -- I didn’t, they didn’t even allowed me to sign because I am Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">Only Lithuanians signed it, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">So that on -- organizations, not only individual peoples. </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">So it is really a breakthrough and sometimes you should not forget that it takes time to -- to -- but -- but anti-Semitism is still there and still -- it -- you can’t say that it’s all over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1481">QUESTION:  In all this positive picture that you just portrayed --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1482">QUESTION:  It’s so positive that it may seem a bit unbalanced. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">The educational activity, the academic activity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">Is it -- is it put 1n focus, th-the -- the fact that those who murdered the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> mer -- were mainly Lithuanians, or just the Germans --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  You see, it -- no, no, no, they -- everybody -- it is hard to recognize, it’s not so easy, but -- but people more and more recognize that some Lithuanians really, they were the executors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">Ma -- not always, but mainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">But the initiators of that still were the Germans, the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">And this is also clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">You -- this is also a mistake when you put everything only on the shoulders of the -- of <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">The -- the worst thing is that Lithuanian independence was declared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">It lasted only for six weeks, and the administration of -- of -- which had never real power, is temporary government, didn’t really know to do a lot about saving Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">Let us put it openly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">So this 1s really when you can ta -- maybe speak about some responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">But otherwise they were auxiliaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">They helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">Lithuanians helped but I wouldn’t say that -- that it was done without, absolutely without Nazi encouraging. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">And as you know, in Yager’s -- in Yager’s report, it 1s said that the -- the Nazis could never succeed so well if they couldn’t find so helpful Lithuanian auxiliaries, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">The partisans who helped them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">But -- but still they don’t deny that they were - and they had the full control -- this is what Yager says, from the second of July, they had full control of all the executions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">End of Tape Three Beginning Tape Four</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Do you --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  So they -- they -- it was -- you know, here I -- I must say that I know that I -- I don’t -- I -- I don’t justify killings and so on, but I think that Jews are sometimes too much inclined to blame only Lithuanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">Because they saw like Lithuanians blamed Jews that they made the deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">It’s just a mytho -- mythology. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">Jews had no power to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">This was done by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , by the K -- by the NK VD, by the -- by -- by very few Jews and even there were some that were mainly -- mainly executors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">But if a Lithuanian saw a Jew coming, so okay, the Jew is deported then, yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1505">QUESTION:  But it’s not by the same token because the Lithuanian did have guns and we know that about 15,000 Lithuanians took part personally in killing and shooting the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">This we know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1507">ANSWER:  But they were organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">No, not 15,000, it’s less now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">Vu -- vu-vu -- but I don’t want to argue about figures, but I want to say that Lithuanians -- Lithuanians were in a terrible situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">In a terrible situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">Here deported, it was a shock to the whole nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">Influenced by a terrible Nazi propaganda, which was also taken as a tool by Luff and by some Lithuanian officials, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">Then, I must say that the past, the -- the antagonistic past which existed between Christians and Jews also had some role to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">So I -- but -- but the nation was really in a shocking -- in a terrible -- in a terrible state at this very moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">And it was really, in some way in the beginning [indecipherable] and then it came, of course it’s dirty business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">But -- but I can’t -- I can’t blame- I will never blame a nation because I know that people were absolutely shocked by what happened [indecipherable]</p>
<p>QUESTION:  But I’m not talking about the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1517">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1518">QUESTION:  I’m talking about few thousand of killers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1519">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1520">QUESTION:  Many of them are still alive now in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1521">ANSWER:  No, no, not many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">Not many. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">How can you say many”? </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">There are not many alive, and -- and maybe -- of course they were -- they’re somewhere hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">I wouldn’t say that our procurator or our <span class="BUILDING">court</span> is very much interesting to persecute them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">But -- and this is maybe the weakest point, but not only we have problems with our -- with our <span class="BUILDING">court</span> and with our procurators, not only in the Jewish commission, in others as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">So, I think, you know, really that --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  How much we have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1528">ANSWER:  Finished?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1529">QUESTION:  He says that it’s finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">I would like to thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">Sorry the -- always we have more to say and I-less time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1532">ANSWER:  Yeah, but we stopped at a very -- a very -- a very important point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1533">QUESTION:  So I -- we should put another tape. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1534">tape break] So we were talking about the question of how <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> is coping with it --its past.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1535">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">I don’t know how I succeeded, but I tried to explain you the -- how complicated the situation was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">And you see, being Jewish, and here is really -- this is very important, that -- and I suffered myself, and Jewish people suffered so much from generalization, from accusing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">If one Jew is bad, all the Jews are so, and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">So I can’t do it to anybody, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">And I think that we have to understand, of course in a different degree, but Lithuanians and the Jews are victims of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">Lithuanians are also victims, because their deportation to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , the -- the -- the terrible historical period after the second World War, when <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> was still fighting for 1ts independence, and of course it is a very controversial moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">But -- but we have to take it also in account. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">You -- you can’t see only your own suffering, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">And therefore, I am very happy I did not -- I didn't want to make you a -- a picture that now in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> everything is solved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">But a German historian, Joachim Tauber, a very good friend of mine, he told me that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> it took 30 years from discussions on the academic level to the conscious of the people to recognize what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">So, it is also -- we have to be a little bit patient. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">We can’t -- we can’t, you know, impose this terrible thing, I think it was the biggest tragedy in Lithuanian history, the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">And I think that for me the Germans, th-the Nazis are even worse enemies than the Soviets, why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">Because the -- the Soviets, we were still -- <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> could -- could resist the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">And -- and -- and they didn’t take away the honor of the nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">And the Nazis in this -- in those times, they made out of some Lithuanian, killers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">So you lose your -- it’s hard for me, it is very sensitive, everything, so in -- in English it’s very -- quite hard for me to explain it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">But you understand, maybe, what I mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1554">QUESTION:  I understand what you mean and it’s very difficult for me to hear such a sentence, the Nazis made out of some Lithuanians killers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1555">ANSWER:  Yeah, they made the situation which --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Really, the kil -- th-the killers who were Lithuanians joined the Nazis, the German Nazis --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1556">QUESTION:  -- and took the opportunity to murder Jews and to loot their property. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">Why didn’t they -- weren’t they brought to justice? </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">Really, if <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> is so positive --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, no, many people were brought to justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">First of all, there were Soviet trials --</p>
<p>QUESTION:  The Soviet trials --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah, there were Soviet trials, which you can’t trust hundred percent.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1560">QUESTION:  But -- but I was asking only after the independence, because --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I told you that 1 -- during the independence it 1s not -- it is the weakest point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1561">QUESTION:  It’s the weakest point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1562">ANSWER:  It’s the weakest point, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">It is the weakest point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">That’s I must -- I -- I must -- I -- I have to admit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">But according to the law they have to be sentenced. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">And you know how it is very strange, but sometimes it’s probably now you can’t prove there are not enough businesses, I don’t know what, but of course I would -- I would -- as a Lithuanian I would take the trial those people and I would recognize -- I think that you -- only when you recognize the whole truth, then you are liberated, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">But -- but you can’t also impose all the time, on -- on another <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> what -- this is a -- a thing which has to grow out of the <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> itself, not imposed by anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1568">QUESTION:  If at -- if at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1569">ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1570">QUESTION:  If at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">If the nation is capable of --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I think that every <span class="COUNTRY">nation</span> , and we have already enough people who are capable and are taking - Brazauskas even went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and apologized, and he was attacked here for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">But now more and more people understand that maybe he was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">You see, it takes time, it -- I see, in the 14 years already, a big breakthrough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">I see also the positive things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">And I think that if you want to achieve something, you have to think in positive terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">You can’t accuse all the time people who have already nothing to do with that, you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1577">QUESTION:  Well --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  And I [indecipherable] for instance, I will -- for me, Holocaust will always be a thing which I will never forget, and I think as a Jewish person I will memorize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">But I don’t want to impose on others to memorize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">That has to be -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> is had to be memorized forever, but here it can -- it is already a question of -- of the people -- of the local people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">And I will tell you, recently I was invited to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> for a talk about tolerance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">And I had a big audience, over a hundred people, different people, and you know that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Siauliai</span> is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Murza</span> 1s located, he is the new Lithuanian neo-Nazi, Lithuanian fascist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">And I got a question, I don’t know if you heard about that, that -- that m -- during Christmas, next to the Christmas tree was standing a menorah because last year Hanukah and Christmas was almost the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">And Murza with his guys came and sir -- oversi -- and -- and crashed this menorah, he was destroying it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">So they asked me what I think about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">So I answered them like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">You see -- you understand that I have two identities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">I am Jewish and I am Lithuanian citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">And as a Jew, I wouldn’t even put on the main square, the menorah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">I would put the menorah in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> which was maybe a Jewish place or a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish place</span> or a synagogue, and I would remember and -- and -- th-the day somehow very -- very modest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">But as a Lithuanian I would be very happy that the menorah stays next to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , because there are no any more Jews here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">There are no any more people can light the candle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">There are no people who can be memorized by somebody because there are no Jews any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">So as a Lithuanian, I would like to memorize -- I would happy to ca -- to light the candle for the - my killed compatriots. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">So you -- can you imagine the -- the reaction was I got applause. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">And people came then and said that -- thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1596">QUESTION:  You know, this is a very nice thing to say, what you just described. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">I wonder if you could have said such a thing as a Lithuanian, unless you were also a Jew.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  -- you have chosen --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  -- oh yes, I can give you names of Lithuanians who would say the same, and even more than I said, because I am still careful, and they would not be careful, they would be much more critical about Lithuanians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">I can name such people like Iapramus Markos, Iacunis Markos, Avido Tostalaikias, Iakeenos Verjunas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">Like Ludas Troska, like Guidos Alexandravichas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">I can --</p>

<p>ANSWER:  -- yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1605">Vytautas Landsbergis told it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1606">QUESTION:  I’m sure about --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  He said Vytaus Landsbergis [indecipherable] many years ago that the -- the Holocaust is not any more a Jewish problem, it’s a Lithuanian problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1607">None of -- there are a lot, but not everybody wants to hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1608">I will give you another example.</span></p>
