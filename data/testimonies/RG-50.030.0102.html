<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Where were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  [...<span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in 19...uh, 1926. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> when I was two months old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Tell me about your family and growing up in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  I was growing up very spoiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I was the only daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I had a brother, four years older than I, and my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My parents died very young, and I was very spoiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">So when I lost my parents, I was more lost than anyone else; because I went to <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> and I was catered and I was supposed to do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Only grow up and go to <span class="BUILDING">ballet</span> and dance.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  What did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  My father had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> of furs and women's clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And my mother used to help him, but always find something else for me to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Ballet, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> ... But the teachers say I'm not good, so I didn't go on with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Did you like ballet?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  I liked ballet, but then my grandfather say I'm too old to go undressed in front of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And I had to stop when the war started in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I couldn't go on anymore; because it was a non- Jewish class, and we couldn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">The Germans didn't allow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  Before the Germans came, what, uh, kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you go to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , uh, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> there 1s called like <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">To <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , yeah, I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">But then they could not...uh, children could not go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for half a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">But after that, I went to the nuns; and I learned English and German private. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">In a <span class="BUILDING">nun's school</span> ...in a <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> went during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">There I learned English and German. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So now I speak six languages a little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  Let's go back a little, so that we don't get confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Uh, what do you remember, if anything, of the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  The invasion was the 10th of May, 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">The Germans came into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> ; and all people, mostly Jewish, went away running to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">La Panne</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">La Panne</span> is on the <span class="DLF">frontier</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And we stayed there for three, four days. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Some people were smart enough, waited for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and went wherever they took them. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">But then the people between them say the Germans are not so bad, and we came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And that was the biggest mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Most of the Jews did run back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And we sort of live a regular life, but we started to feel that we were not allowed to go on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We are not allowed to go that. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And other people had left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  Uh, talk a little more about, uh, what those early years under the Germans were like. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Did you have any restrictions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  We had a lot of restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">We couldn't go in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We couldn't go to a <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Uh, they more or less closed the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Twice a week, we could go then. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And it was felt what I didn't look exactly like Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So sometimes I would go out to Raphaele, my friend, without the Star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And the Germans wouldn't know; because her mother had Germans coming over to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and the Germans liked me very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So one day, he [a German] liked me as a child, because I was the age of his daughter that was left in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">But I was, uh, old enough and smart enough to know that he's a German and I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">But the next day of that happening, I went in the main <span class="DLF">street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> --de Keyserlei, they call it-- with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And I had the star on. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And here, towards me, comes the same German. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So my reaction was to run in the first <span class="BUILDING">store</span> I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My mother didn't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So the next day he says to my friend's mother, "I could have sworn I saw Anny with a st...uh, as a Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But she's not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Why would it be? </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But she looks exactly like Anny!" </span><span class="sentence" id="63">If he would have known that I'm Jew--as much as he loved me and I looked like his daughter--he would have...he would have uh called the Gestapo and they would have taken me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So miracle after miracle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  Was your friend...your friend was obviously not Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  My girlfriend, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">She also helped my grandfather, who was very old at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">She brought him food and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">She endangered her life, because she put a star on. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">She went like if she would be Jewish; and went to my grandfather and brought him food and brought him some things. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Went to my uncle that is in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> now, to his wife, and brought them food. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And she did a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And some people don't appreciate. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">But I appreciate every minute what she did for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I'll give her first the money before I eat myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And so do my husband and my sister-in-laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">They'll send her all the time checks; because they say if I...1f not her, they wouldn't have me. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And they love me dearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">That's what they say. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I hope it's true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Let's go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Her name is Raphaele...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  Raphaele Saintnoy. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Her name was Jeanine, but she changed it when she started to paint. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Her name is Raphaele Saintnoy. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">She's approximately a year old...younger than I am.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Did the two of you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  We went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And she loved my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">She loved my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">She came very often to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">She even, before the war started, started talking Yiddish; because she loved the Yiddish language. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">She loved Jews. '</span><span class="sentence" id="94">Til now, she loves Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  What about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> during those years? </span><span class="sentence" id="96">This is 1940...'41. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">What did you and Raphaele do about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Uh, we could not go more than three times a week; and Raphaele went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And my mother had wanted me to go to a certain <span class="BUILDING">university</span> out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">But I couldn't do it; because in '42, I was gone and my parents were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I was gone to my <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But '40, '41, you were still going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> somewhere?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  It was a little tense; 'cause some of my family went to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , some to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And my mother wanted very badly to go to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We had the tickets to go to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , where I had an uncle; and we had everything everyday. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But my father didn't want to leave his father and his mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And he say, "I'll sacrifice my family for my parents." </span><span class="sentence" id="111">That's what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We also had, in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> --was five floors--on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> , lived a man with a woman that he worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And he did a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">On the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> , lived a woman with two daughters who were going with the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And that was very bad for my parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  How was it bad?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Bad, because she owed my father some hundred francs. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">That is nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And she thought that my father would want to have the hundred francs. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And he told her always, "I don't want the money back." </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So one day, she came and she said, "I'm sorry, but as you live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> [where] there's no Jewish, the German forgot to take you. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And I called up the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">They should take you on Tuesday, 8:30, the 19th." </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So my mother started to laugh. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">She says, '"You--my friend who gave us up!" </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So my father said, "I don't believe you." </span><span class="sentence" id="127">She said, "Please go away." </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And Tuesday at 8:30 they came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Your parents did not go away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  They went. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Tuesday at 8:30, the SS came....

<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  Where were you during this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  I, a few minutes before, they put me by Raphaele's aunt--her father's sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">She lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">La Hulpe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">It's written in the book. </span><span class="sentence" id="148"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">La Hulpe</span> is like half an hour from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It's a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And they had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">The man that I called "Uncle" worked as a manager in a very big <span class="BUILDING">book store</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">They had a daughter that was retarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So I took care of the daughter, while they paid for me--I don't remember how much it is--three thousand Belgian francs every month. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So after my parents were deported, I was afraid they'll give me up because no money coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">She took me properly. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">She needed the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So what happened... So she uh...I couldn't...1 couldn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">It went on coming, the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">The landlord where we lived, my father told him, "Please send. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Save my daughter." </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And he sent, from his own pocket, every month three thousand Belgian francs for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Even I paid the three thousand francs, I had to help in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">She used to say, "If you don't know, you cannot tell somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">You better clean the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">You break an egg. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">You can get an egg. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">You have to wait until tomorrow's eggs." </span><span class="sentence" id="168">But she never, never made pork while I lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">She respected me. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">She never put pork on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , or on the dishes. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Never, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I used to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I had my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> ; and she used to say, "Pray for your God here." </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I said, "It's a little hard." </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But Sunday was the only day I went out --for an hour to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">The neighbors should see that I go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">They thought I'm a sick niece who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , and the doctor prescribed me to be in, uh, <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ... Not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="178">That's the reason I came to live with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">But they were very nice, very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They wanted even to adopt me after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">But my uncle wouldn't let me become a shikse [Yidd: non-Jewish girl]. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">But they liked me very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And the man helped me a lot, with sending the three thousand francs; because God forbid if I would be taken away, uh, the woman--my "Aunt," like I called her--would be taken away, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Because the people who hide other people... And I'll never forget Raphaele, as long as I live. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">People forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I never forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Because thanks to her, I'm alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  You were living with Raphaele's aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Uh, what kind of papers did you have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="190">ANSWER:  I had an identity card. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Identity card on the name from Raphaele Saintnoy, and that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I was Raphaele Saintnoy. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I got stamps for food under her name, and I was under her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">But even then I was the... How do you say? </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Somebody told about me, that I was Jewish, and they should go in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and there is a Jewish girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">They squealed. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And when they squealed, the Germans came to look for me, as I told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And the first time they came to look for me, it was a minute or two minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And I had a cord with...like steps; and I put it up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Nobody could go up there, 1t was so narrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I put the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> , and I was there for five and a half hours. [</span><span class="sentence" id="202">When] they took me out, I was fainted; because it was all the smoke from the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">It was near the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> on the attic __. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">It was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">The second time they came, I was in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> unexpected. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And they had pictures on me, whom they look for. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">So my "Aunt" made...digged a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in five minutes--I don't know how she did it--put me in, and put the <span class="DLF">hole</span> .... Like if I would be buried alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">They looked and they looked and they looked, and they walked on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">They never found me. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So anyway, my lawyer was not a good lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">He found that I have not enough reasons to get, uh they call it...
QUESTION:  Reparations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  Reparation. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Because I wasn't born in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  What else do you remember from those two years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  These two years were very hard, for one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Because my "Aunt"--the woman, Raphaele's aunt--and [her] husband didn't live very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And I was very naive. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">He was an intellectual, and he was sorry that the only child they have was retarded. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So they didn't get along so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And I used to take the part of her and of him, to make shalom b'bayit [Heb: "peace in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> "]; and not always did I succeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And it was aggravating me, because my parents never spoke a loud word to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">When they would like discuss, they would go to the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">My brother and I wasn't, uh, there. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And I wasn't used to see people, who live together and loved each other, [who] shouldn't talk for days. [</span><span class="sentence" id="271">Who] should eat together, and make like was a stranger. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I wasn't used like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I wasn't brought up like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">'Cause I was brought up in a very warm and loving family my parents had. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So it was hard for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And I all the time thought, "When my parents come back, I'll appreciate them more. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And if my brother comes alive, I'll never get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Take care of him all my life, as long as I live." </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But it didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">It didn't happen, so I can't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And it's still...when people are with their children, are complaining, it hurts me. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Because, thank God, they have normal children and parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">They have old mothers, old fathers. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">My mother was 43 and my father 41 when they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So it's very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And my brother was 17 or 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">He had nothing from life. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">So it's very painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And sometimes, you'll remember... Like my uncle who lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , he lost a child of six years and a child of 18 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">A little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And he went through a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">A lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">But, uh, that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Never hurts--uh, it was hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">These two years were like twenty years. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Because if you don't know who you are, or you forget maybe... But I didn't forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And I had a picture of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Day and night, I looked at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And since...after the war, when I knew that they won't come back, and I hear bad news or something--God forbid--I can't cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">See me sitting here? </span><span class="sentence" id="303">It's <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , the pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I cannot cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">It's hard for me to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">It's healthy to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">But I just can't cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">Like last night, I was thinking about this morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">But I can't cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Some people just cry, but I have it inside me. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And I don't forget one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And it's not easy to get along without parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">But I remember what is the worst in my whole life is my father took me to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , they would pick me up to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">La Hulpe</span> , where I would stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I had only two dresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">One dress and a blouse for the week, and another dress with other pieces for Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So I only had... the socks were mended so hard it spoiled my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Because she mended our socks. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">We couldn't afford...she couldn't afford to buy me. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">But the worst thing that I remember is [that] my father took me to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And we walked on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> for fifteen minutes; and there comes the German that my father didn't see. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And he slapped my father, because he didn't go down the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> when you are...when he was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And I'll never forget, my father told me in Yiddish--because French maybe [they] understand--"Don't do anything." </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Because I was ready to slap him, and then he would take me along. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">But I never forget the feeling, to see... With so much respect for my parents, that I saw somebody slapping my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I...I couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">But it was... 1t was very painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Very painful.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  The American or the English...the English came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And the <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> knew that I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">We told them. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">They were very proud of Raphaele's aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And when you had a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you had to take somebody to live in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Because they needed a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And we took in an English soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">His name was Tom; and he got a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">He used to bring his Cadbury chocolates, so I shined his shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> together--my aunt, he and I.

<p><span class="sentence" id="389">ANSWER:  My uncle was in the same <span class="BUILDING">house</span> as his wife and her parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">They were Belgian citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Once you're a Belgian citizen, the Queen say, "The German made a pact. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">They won't take a Belgian citizen." </span><span class="sentence" id="393">So she was living there in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with the two little children and her parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Her sister--my aunt's sister, my uncle's sister-in-law--didn't want to stay in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">She went with false papers to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and was killed--eight months pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">But the other ones were staying in the big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .

So nice <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> --they would lock the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and come a day or two later to pick up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , the clothes and the diamond and the silverware. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So he couldn't go out; and he was blocked in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> from Friday 'til Monday. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">On Monday, the maid who came in, she knew about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">She went on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> of a neighbor and went in to him on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Then they went out from the <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">She brought him clothes from her husband and identity card. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">But my uncle looked very Jewish and has evidently a beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So he shaved and he shaved, and he went with her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And they succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">She put him in a <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Him and another Jewish couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">The <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> [Mother] Superior knew; but all the other nuns didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And he shaved five to six times a day, while wearing the clothes from the nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">But he shaved five to six times. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And he ate kosher all the time, believe it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">She brought him sometimes food, and he wouldn't eat too much, because he was religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And after a year, after the war was over, he came and he found the little slippers. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">They never took it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">But uh...they were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">They were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , too--like my parents.</span></p>

'</span><span class="sentence" id="449">Til he had to accept that the child--the child was the worst thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">For 18 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">It was the worst thing for him, and for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And then--two days after the English and the American came--my grandmother spent all that time in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">My grandmother...

<p><span class="sentence" id="514">ANSWER:  She survived very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Her mother died, and her father died. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And she...her father died after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">She was living with her father. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">She was working very hard, all kind of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">She was a Saleslady, a painter, a sculptor. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">She's a little Bohemian, because she's a very good artist. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And I'm sorry that now she has that <span class="DLF">farm</span> , and has to paint and sell her paintings. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">But, uh, she say, "If you want, I can give one painting." </span><span class="sentence" id="523">She send me. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And it's a very nice painting. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">It's the world, Adam and Eve. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">She's very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And she...I forgot to bring it, but she's very good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">QUESTION:  But during the war....
ANSWER:  During the war, she went to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">She finished <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , like they call it here. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">And uh she was very gifted. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">But she could not stay in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">She needs her...she needs <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">She needs open <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">That's the reason, I think, she stays on that <span class="DLF">farm</span> ; and I talked about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I explained to her that I would like her very much to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> now; and we go... And spend some time with us, and go and see if you can go in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I think in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , she would feel very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">'Cause she likes that kind of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And they would accept her, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">She was a person who helped a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I think the kibbutz would accept her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">QUESTION:  What...what did it feel like to you, during the war, when you were...you had Raphaele.... You had false papers in Raphaele's name, while Raphaele kept your own papers? </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Uh, how did you manage day-to-day on those papers? </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Did you have to show them often?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">ANSWER:  The problem was that I lived day-to-day. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Because sometimes the man called me, wanted to know my real name. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">But I was not stupid. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I told him that's my name. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">But one time, I had a very big problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And my "Aunt" that kept me was very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I went to a girlfriend to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And I shouldn't have gone; because in the front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of that girlfriend was a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and they had just picked up Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And that boy who was sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">He wanted to go with me to my "Aunt" Paulette--her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And "Aunt" Paulette didn't want to accept. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">When he saw me, he told the Germans, "She is Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Put her in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with me." </span><span class="sentence" id="560">But when the German went down, I was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">I was very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I was gone; but for three days, I was very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Like shock. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I was so nervous. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I was so afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">How a person can.... "If I am in a problem, I want you to be." </span><span class="sentence" id="567">He shouldn't have done that. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And he knew me. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">But he told the German; and I was maybe not far away, and that's what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I don't know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I had the courage to stand up in a second; because he just had to go down from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and he showed . </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And they looked and they looked in all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> ; but I put a scarf over my head, and he didn't look at my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And when he came in, he didn't see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">He didn't know who I am. "</span><span class="sentence" id="576">I was looking for that girl, but..." You understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">So it was very hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">QUESTION:  Did you have other escapes like this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  I had a few escapes that I told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">That he took my papers at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">He said...
QUESTION:  Which he?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="582">ANSWER:  The man who kept the...who kept the identities cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">The identity cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">He called me to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ; and he told me, "Give me your card. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">I'll give it back to you next week, ‘cause I have to change the age, or the time or something." </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And I had a feeling that I shouldn't give it. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And I had not discussed it with my "Aunt," but I had a feeling not to give him. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And I say, "No, she'll give you next week." </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And next morning, at six in the morning, he was killed with the papers from 25 or 40 people that he had. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And all these people were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And I thank God.... Must have been a will from God that, uh, that I wasn't taken; because he didn't have my papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">If he would have my papers, it would be the same as my papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">So that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And, uh, I had a lot of little events; events that I would feel bad if...like Germans would go in the front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and go and look for something or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">So instinctively, I thought it's for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">I got nervous that they're looking for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">But I think when you are in the situation, you are stronger and braver. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I could pay attention myself you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I knew when to let go, because like when he ...they looked for me when I was like buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I knew I have to breathe my nose, my mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I have to keep up 'til they come to save me. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">When they came, they were happy that I was breathing; because it was very hard for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So, problem is that uh the closest from my aunt's, my uncle's--twenty-four people the closest--were taken all to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So sometimes I say, if people complain, people should be happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">It is a too narrow <span class="DLF">road</span> , people set in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , came from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">But there is no one day that I forget my parents or Raphaele. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Because she...really did a lot for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And if not, I wouldn't be alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So that's the reason I always want her to feel good, to buy something special for her, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">That's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">QUESTION:  Anything you want to add?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="612">ANSWER:  Well, then my uncle came to <span class="COUNTRY">Uruguay</span> , got married and lives now in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">Has two boys-- two sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">That's it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="615">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Thank you very much. </span>
