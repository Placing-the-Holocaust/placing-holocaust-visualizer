For me, as a child, the most horrible memories was to see my mother... uh...suffering to see us as children being so deprived of any kind of humanity, of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And...uh...when I think of it, what my mother went through was even worse than me as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Because as a child, you can fantasize with certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I remember...I now one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">When we lived on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , one of my favorite flowers and living now in <span class="REGION">California</span> , I try to grow it and I have a hard time, 1s Nostortum. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And it has a wonderful scent although here it doesn't have the same scent as back then. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And I could put myself in a trance to smell that Nostortum in the..in the midst of death or anything, just to...Jjust to experience some life. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">It was a wonderful feeling even if I felt any kind of pain when I would cut myself and so forth to know that I am alive because as a child, I felt I wasn't alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I was just walking around in the midst of all the death...of death. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And...uh...it's a miracle that one can live so few... few years that the few years...1t was a quite a few years and the months and the days and hoping the next day something will be better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  What most stands out in your mind from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  From the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Is (sigh) (long pause) The things that stands out most of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> is the helplessness of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And the good in the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And some of it the bad in the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I feel the heroism that there were for caring for one another in the midst of death, and I also can remember the bad of people against each other because of this situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">That's why I say in a situations like this, you get the best and you get the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And the most outstanding, the most memorable thing that I have and the most horrifying thing is when we had to go and to be to stand in appell and you see they would have proclamation and they would say this and this section have to go to this and this <span class="DLF">field</span> , and we never knew which <span class="DLF">line</span> would come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">It would be one would say left, one right, and it became apparent that if one family stood together very rarely would they take the whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They may just leave one member or two and now as an adult, I could see what was so easy to break the will to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Because when you are in situation where they take your mother or your brother or your sister, how do you feel? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I mean the kind of psychologically what you're going through in your mind and how you feel about, you don't almost care what happens to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">You want to be with that person. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And...uh...so it became apparent how to outsmart them is to separate, not to stand together as a family and...uh... and that was something that I will never forget when...uh...we had...we finally were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">My brother was taken and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , and we were taken in...into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and... uh...we were shipped...we were going...we were standing up like sardines in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and not...and they always seemed to be doing it on the worst raining or dreary or snowy days...uh...hot days...uh...and those are the kinds that ...that stands out. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">The other thing that stands out in my mind, I remember when we...we stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived in...uh...there was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we had to share with about nine families in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and there was hardly any kind of <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and this one person who was...uh...with the...uh... with the Jewish police and...uh...he gave, evidently, my name to be taken instead of his child...uh...and...uh... two other children and I happened not to be in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> when they came to take me, and they took his child instead of me, and he came back and he started throwing things and hitting me and screaming at my mother and that I was supposed to go instead of his daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So incidents like that and...uh... never leaves your mind, you know, and...uh...you feel helpless, and you're constantly in a state of helplessness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Did you have your aunts and uncles and cousins with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Uh...My cousins and my aunts and uncles all lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Josvani</span> and some lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiddon</span> and they were all massacred. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Uh...When I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> I found out that about 147 members of my family were taken out to a flield and they were all shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And how I know is a cousin who was with them who...uh...thought that he was...they thought that he was killed...he was shot...was shot and was able to crawl out from wherever he was on the <span class="DLF">field</span> , and crawl and practically on his belly and he collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Uh...They...in a <span class="BUILDING">farm house</span> , and the people took pity on him and he stayed there all through the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , and then went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> and he got married and my brother brought them to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and he just died about 2 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">That's how I knew that the whole family... The first thing after we survived, we looked for all the family, and there was hardly any, except a distant cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and this man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  How long did you consider...Were you as a child smuggling food in and out all this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Quite...quite a bit, and...uh...a number of times and...uh...my mother did not know in the very beginning and my brother tells me stories that he was asked to join the Partisans and he had a chance to escape, but he wanted my older sister to go with him and she wouldn't go and leave my mother and me, and so they stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Uh...It's that kind of heroism and unselfishness that you want to, you know, to hold on to one's family whatever was...was left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  Can you describe the appell that you were in when your brother was taken and tell us what happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Well, we were asked to...it was very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">It was...uh...very early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Uh ..We had to assembly out there to... They said to bring just whatever we can carry and we didn't have very much, and we came to this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">It was hugh <span class="DLF">field</span> , and it was in...uh...the time...you know you lose time whether it's the months and the days and so forth, but I know one thing that the <span class="DLF">field</span> was already...the vegetation of the <span class="DLF">field</span> was gone, so it had to be like in the late fall. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And we were told to stand there, and what we were doing, we didn't know and we stood and we waited and we waited and...uh...towards...uh...the evening, like around...was already getting dark, towards dark, around dust, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came and they went left right and they took my brother away. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">They took, in fact, they took ...uh...all the men away, and all the men were taken away, and we stood there and after awhile, we were put into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And (sigh) it was just no <span class="NPIP">place</span> even to breath and we...we drove through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and...uh...they brought us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> and...uh...

<p><span class="sentence" id="354">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And why did she take you to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Tell me why.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  Well, she took us to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> because they...uh...her <span class="NPIP">place</span> was German soldiers would stay over night. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Her husband was in the Wehrmacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">He was some official in the Wehrmacht, and they would...would be like a <span class="BUILDING">way station</span> where they would come there and stay there and we worked the <span class="DLF">farm</span> for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And then one day she said that we were going to go with her to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , and the reason that she had to leave 1s any...that she heard the rumor is that they would let the <span class="DLF">sewer</span> out and they would flood the <span class="REGION">area</span> because it was very strategic from what we could understand because at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Danzig</span> and so the Allies couldn't invade it. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And so we were taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Now...uh...she lost, as I said before, 6 of her children. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We...when we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> ...for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> and she stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swininger</span> as a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Uh...A little later...uh...another reporter came and asked us all kinds of questions and he said...asked us about Mrs. Anstom. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And we told her how terrible she 1s, and he says, "She's in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And I said...we said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And he said, "Where is she?" </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And I said, "Well, she was left behind in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Swininger</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And he said, "That's no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">He can find her." </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And he would like to...would we like to testify because he would like to bring her to trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And so we decided that was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We really wanted her to...you know, to confront her. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But we wanted to confront her also as Jews, not as Lithuanian Catholics, so I remember Paula Yensen going and outfitting us in new clothes and I remember...uh...I still....1 wore my kerchief which I didn't tell is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stutthof</span> , they tore my hair which is out completely, and for about 2 years I had no hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">So I was always wearing a kerchief, and she got me a new kerchief, except I wouldn't let me see what the kerchief she used to put me <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">veranda</span> whenever it was sunny and put egg yolks which was rationed and I would stand on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I didn't want to sit <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and just dry it because one of the doctors told her that that would be the best thing for growing hair on my hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">She really is responsible to get my hair back. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And we got all dressed up with the new kerchief and we went to the <span class="BUILDING">court house</span> and the judge said, "What's your name?" </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And we...my sister said, Rachel Becker. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Oh, she...the first thing she...he said, "Do you recognize them?" </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And she said, "Yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And she...he said, "What's their name?" </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And she said, "Anna Becker and Yuta Becker." </span><span class="sentence" id="385">and they're. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And he said, "What nationality?" </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And she says, "They're...they are...uh...they are Lithuanians and they are Catholic." </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And he said, "Could you tell them your name?" </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And my sister said, "Rachel Becher" and I said, "Judith Becker." </span><span class="sentence" id="390">In fact, I didn't say "Judith Becker...Judith Becker." </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And...uh...he said, "Mrs. Anstom, what is your religion?" </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And she said, "I am Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">I am a devout Catholic." </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And he said, "And you did that to Catholics? </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Can you imagine what you would have done if you knew they were Jewish?" </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And the outcome was that she was found guilty and she was deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">She...they kept her 1n <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> and so while she was appealed because she did not want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to...uh...which was...I think she was...that time was <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> , and she didn't want to go back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And she lost her appeal for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And that was our greatest...1t was just such a wonderful feeling to be able to do that.</span></p>
