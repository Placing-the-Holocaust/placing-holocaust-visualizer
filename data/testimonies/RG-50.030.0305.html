<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Solomon Rodashinksy. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born and raised in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My birthday is May 17, 1910. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">All my life I was in <span

rest of the family, my father's side was six brothers and three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My mother's was two sisters and three brothers, so we had a big family. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Over there, I figured out after the war how many people is alive, I never find it to now nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I was looking in papers, conventions, I was going in 1981 and in 1993 the Washington D.C. and then in 1985 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">There was a convention I ever missed, I advertised through the radio, through the television, through the . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Still now I get some papers from the , they ask me to find somebody and until now I never saw a person pointing their finger saying I know you. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">There was 78 people including nieces, nephews, all of the family, and I’m the one alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I ask myself many times why, why am I alive? </span><span class="sentence" id="13">But, maybe God leave it me to be alive to sometime say the way I am and what I am and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Then in 1940 Yom Kippur day, it comes out they're going to make a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> don't take too long from Yom Kippur to November 15, everybody had to come out and where to find a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">It was very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Some people never let in, but later on they did it because the Jewish section around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was around and we found a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> of less in , the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">But there was on the one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , six people, my mother, my father, three sisters and I who were the six. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I think one of my brothers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and the winter time -- and Europe's winter time is not like here, a little day like yesterday morning you say oh it's cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I say it's cold too, because I'm already 45 years here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but the life was very, very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Until they come into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was so terrible, people were laying in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Mostly the people were coming around from around the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> behind <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Balsa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">The Germans throw out and make it the third . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The third means any people can't live around in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the third . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">People with little children, they're in the <span class="DLF">street</span> every morning we saw the dead in the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">When the Jewish commander ; that means people would come and pick up the dead people in little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hand trailers</span> and bring that to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">They made big, big <span class="DLF">holes</span> and they put in 100 to 200 people and they covered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">No food. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So, when I'm talking about, I see the picture from my eyes what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">There was a young guy, his name was Rubinstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">He was no crazy, he made it crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">He was running around in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , I have to say a few words in Yiddish what he said , that means we're all the same and the fat get off, so it's no one higher than the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And he knows to who to go and ask for money. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">You got a cat, give me money. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Give me five , like you say here five dollars and if you're going to give me I'm going to holler and we got scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Everybody give him, he got a full cap with money, he go around in those sections with the poor people laying in the <span class="DLF">street</span> with their children and take the money and throw tt, and they grabbed the money and bring the money again, just money. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">He helped those poor people in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">This was not help too, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">There come a time 1942, July 22, the about 2 o'clock signs in the <span class="DLF">street</span> who wants to go to work and get two bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Our bread at that time, our bread is not like you got it here, a pint, a bread is a kilo. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">A kilo is close to two and half pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">People pushed one into the other one. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Everybody like to be the first to get the bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">The first transport as 20,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They don't know where they're going. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Nobody don't know but the president and the Jewish commander his name was . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">He hid a man, a Pollock and he paid him money to follow the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> with 20,000 people and that Pollock took that money and never came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">The next day he did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He gave another Pollock the money and follow it. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">He never came back, but <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> is not too far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , is 120 kilometers is like 80 miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">The third day comes a young man blonde, he never looked like a Jew and he took off his arm band and put on a cap like the Pollocks used to wear with the leather, and he said 80 years old the guy is, all but 6'2" tall and he said I risk my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I'm going to follow that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and I'm coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I don't want no money and I'm coming back and I'm going to see what's going on and he followed and he was coming back and it was told Mr. this and this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> is a crematortum. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">The people coming down in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> is no selection like they make selections in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , it is no selection they tell them to get off their clothes and they tell them they're going in to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> , and they cut off their hair, everybody, the men, the women and they shave their heads and they're going in a <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> , they close the <span class="DLF">door</span> , outside in the corner there is a man who brings down the switch. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">They bring down the switch and it pumps gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">He heard that and the people were hollering, children crying and a while later, he said they come in and they're taking out little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hand trailers</span> , put it down and bring that to the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> put them in the <span class="BUILDING">ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">He told this, Mr. , when I speak many times about this, I tell their story. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">To me the men did a big mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He's supposed to say for the public what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">There's no <span class="NPIP">where</span> to go any way, what you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">He did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">He called his whole family, brothers, sisters, brother- in-laws, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and closed all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , and put in all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> the gas, and they killed themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The next morning we find it out with a note what this is and they're all dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">They're dead, nobody can take their life. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">They come in and take that way and they were going the same way the others were, the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">That time, the organizations the communists other , allies got together and seen to protect what they can protect. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">but Pollocks used to come in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they don't suppose they smuggle in themself. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">One bring a few potatoes, one bring a bread, and he asked you want a suit. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We give him our suit and they give us bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Whatever he wanted, we give him. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">He asked not for money and the people got clothes and they got in contact with the <span class="REGION">Polish side</span> only risk was some of them take the money and they bring a gun and they bring a rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">They bring some bullets. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Some of them say no send me the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">How can we send the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">There was

it's getting a little dark those children were going over on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> smuggling. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">They used to buy some bread, potatoes, carrots. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Early in the morning, six o'clock in the morning when we can walk and get daylight, they're coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">With their children we're sending all the money and they send the ammunition and they bring ammunition and many times if they send the children through the <span class="DLF">canals</span> , the <span class="DLF">drains</span> in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , the <span class="DLF">drains</span> in the <span class="DLF">street</span> was dry because when they used no water, there was nothing to cook so there was no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">It should have gone through the <span class="DLF">drains</span> and <span class="DLF">canals</span> in the <span class="DLF">street</span> to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and bringing in bottles with gasoline, and we make bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Fill a bottle with gasoline and
