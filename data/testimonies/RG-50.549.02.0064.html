<p>ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I think there’s a idea of <span class="NPIP">paradise</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="9">indecipherable] wonderful friends, and it keeps me busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Matter of fact, I have to get up every morning 6:30, seven o’clock just to keep busy, cause I go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> five times a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Oh, you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  I sure do, sure do. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And I lecture on the -- on Holocaust and German history. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I don’t get paid for it, and plus I was a volunteer in an old age home, in an <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span> , in an hospital, except I had to stop it because I had a triple bypass, and a pacemaker, so I cannot do heavy lifting -- or very heavy lifting, so I stopped that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Okay, let’s pause. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">This is an interview with Beno Helmer, conducted on March third, 2000, by Arwin Donohue. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">This is a follow up interview to a videotaped interview that was conducted with Mr. Helmer, and this interview will focus on his post-Holocaust experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">The videotaped interview focused on his Holocaust era experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We may go back and -- and discuss some of the Holocaust era experiences that weren’t mentioned in the first interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">This is tape number one, side A. And, Mr. Helmer, I thought we would start with the moment of your liberation, and -- and move forward from there, and we’ll see how -- how it goes, as far as going back before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And you described in your first interview how you were -- the circumstances of your liberation, and how the am -- U.S. army came into the -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camp</span> where you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And I wondered -- you mentioned something about this moment of freedom, and I wondered if you would talk a little bit about what that -- what freedom meant to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Let me regress a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The day of -- when I was liberated, it wan -- matter of fact, I think to -- let’s say 24 hours before I was liber -- I was -- got the worst beating in my lifetime. [</span><span class="sentence" id="26">indecipherable] I still have scars on my head and my shoulders, because the commander told us to march with him wherever he wanted to march, and I refused him. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So he had a big, huge stick, and he beat me mercilessly. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And I gonna die, but I’d rather die instead of marching with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Some hours later, down the <span class="DLF">road</span> , we saw a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> with a big, white, five star -- s -- five star -- star emblem. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">W-We didn’t know what that’s -- I didn’t know what that’s -- this means the American army, I know the five star emblem was the Russian army, so we thought that’s the Russian army came. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">But it wasn’t so, because hours later, one s-single soldier came in, a short, little fellow what had a -- a -- a- a rucksack on his back, and he said he is an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">It was a little fellow from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And the first thing he said, ““Where is there water?” </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He was thirsty, so I said, “We have a water fo -- water pump, but you’re not allowed to drink it,” -- be -- matter of fact, the first time I went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , the commander told us we are not allowed to drink from this water, because this may give typhoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And he said 1f anybody’s drinking from this <span class="DLF">fountain</span> , he going to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And he said, “To prove to you,” he took out his pistol, took an innocent man, and shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">A Russia-Russian worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">This <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> consisted of building prisoner of war camps for the American flyers, which was never finished, and that’s the reason we slept on sand. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So now, let’s go right -- back to the American soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">He said he was thirsty. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So we said to him, “You cannot drink from this <span class="DLF">fountain</span> , because you’re going to die.” </span><span class="sentence" id="42">He says, “No problem.” </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Took the water, put it in his <span class="INT_SPACE">canteen</span> , and put a pill into his water, shook it, and he drank it, and I think this was the biggest miracle I ever saw in my lifetime at that time, that he survived, he didn’t die from his -- because of this little pill. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">A few hours later he says he going to bring some food, give it to it -- va -- ba -- bring us food because we were starving. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I mean, when I was liberated, after aid already, I was weighing 92 or 94 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So in that evening, or next day, the French came with a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> which had a big kettle of soup, in -- in the back, and the French men, they -- they said, “That’s the fr -- thanks to the French liberation,” which wasn’t so, “we going to sing “The Marseilles.’” </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And I had a friend of mine which name Is ra -- Ravel Monya -- Monyek Ravel. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And I said, “I will not sing the French national anthem, because they did not liberate us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So I said, “Ravel, since we are free, let’s get out of here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He says, “No, I don’t want to go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I said, “Ravel, good-bye, I am leaving.” </span><span class="sentence" id="52">He followed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And this how I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , but it -- the biggest miracle I saw that time was the <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> with the pill in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  I should just say that in your first interview, you did talk about that period, and you talked about your liberation, so I asked the question just to find out a little bit more about what was going on <span class="NPIP">inside</span> of you at that time, as far as what you -- you said, you know, this was a moment of realizing that you were free, and -- and what -- and whether that meant -- did you have any sense of allegiance to any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , or any people, or -- or what- what were your thoughts <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  No, thi -- at that point, I felt I was an <span class="BUILDING">orphaned</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">This the first time I felt I was an orphan, because it was bewildering being free. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">What does that mean being free? </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Do I go wherever I want to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Or do I go where they going to tell me to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And in -- [ -- I didn’t have anything, no clothing, I had no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French camp</span> , and I -- I start missing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I missed my parents, I missed my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">My sister, I thought she was perished anyways. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">She was a very, very skinny, little girl, so I said she cannot survive the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But I had a brother of mine, which was six years younger than I was, I said, “He was a strong lad, maybe he survived.” </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But unfortunately, the fate wa -- dealt us a different card. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">The only one who survived was my sister, nobody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So when I walked out, I wanted to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And -- and we marched, Monyek and I, we marched, and I’m sure I told it before, this -- I was -- first time I was encountered with baseball. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I spoke about the baseball, so it’s -- I don’t have to spay about that any more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  No, you don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Yeah, you did mention that. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And you also mentioned -- when you mentioned Monyek, did you -- yo-you told about how you took leave of him because he had wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and you had --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Correct.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  Correct, correct, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  ’'m wondering, did you ever have contact with Monyek again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  No, I found out Monyek went to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I wrote it to the Jewish HIAS, or it was some organization in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , to get in touch with Monyek Ravel, but it never, never got- never I got an answer, never heard from him since. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">That’s correct, I completely forgot. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">He want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and I want to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And I’m sure I told you I finally wound up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">The American took me to DP camp in -- I told him I was Polish, and I decided it’s going to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , it’s closer to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Teplice</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in -- I told him I was Polish, and I decided it’s going to Poland, it’s closer to go to Poland, from Poland to -- to Teplice, to Czechoslovakia, than -- than staying where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So you know the story about the rape of the women in the -- in the -- in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">garage</span> , and I don’t know if you know this, when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , finally came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , I got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I was sick, and I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and the clothing, I was changed because I was full of lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Told you this story, too.</span></p>
