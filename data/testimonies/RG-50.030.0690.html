<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  And when you went to a <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian school</span> , was it any different, or —

<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  I feel like you kind of touched on this, but did your family live in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> , interact mostly with Jewish people, or mixed Hungarian —
ANSWER:  Well, basically, there was such a huge Jewish population in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , that you can hardly pinpoint a — a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I mean —
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">May 8, 2013
ANSWER:  — all — all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> had Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We were living basically, in the <span class="REGION">area</span> which — right — right on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> where — where actually, where the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish embassy</span> bought most of those <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , later on, I mean, we — were not there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">But that — that is where — where the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish embassy</span> bought all those <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It was right on the — on the shore of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> , right in front of Saint Margaret’s island, Margitteet(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And it was really — it was a wealthy community, it was — you had to have a certain — certain economic status to be able to live there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  And — but then there were <span class="BUILDING">Jewish synagogues</span> , Jewish [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">There were — there — there wi — there was even a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> three or four blocks down, on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But you couldn’t pinpoint it as really — as a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">There were a lot of Jews in there, but not — not necessarily Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So let’s move forward a little bit, and talk about your father’s travels, and how it brought him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and — and the dates when that happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">ANSWER:  Well, my father, around 19 — well, he — he — he had constantly — was constantly on the move, trying to locate raw materials, he — he went to <span class="NPIP">places</span> , you know, which we thought were absolutely the end of the world, like <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> or <span class="REGION">north Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But there were — there was considerable wool merch — wool — wool products, used wool products there. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He had the brother, for example that he set upMay 8, 2013 in business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , collecting for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But no ma — he had — they had a relationship with the English company called John Crowther and Sons, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milnsbridge</span> , which supplied a lot of raw material too, but th-they were always starved for raw material. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So my father decided that the only sizable <span class="NPIP">place</span> that he could think of that would have raw material was the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And basically, he also had there two brothers and a sister, which he hadn’t seen in some 30 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So he, you know, he figured all of these things together, my mother wouldn’t go, because we had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and so forth, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Those trips were long. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And he — he planned to be away for a long, long, long period of time, because he had to set up this business. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So he actually came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and he — he set up a business in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Passaic</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , and he spent here well over six months, I think about nine months, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And then he decided to go back to — to Europe, and he got as far as <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , but he was turned back, because the Germans had invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So, he basically got onto the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that he took to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">He made a second attempt to return to <span class="REGION">southern Europe</span> , but he only got as far as <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , and he had to turn back. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And then, of course, the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was very, very — should we Say, not receptive to — to — to refugees from an — anybody from Europe, as they had this quota system, which I understand 90 percent of the quota were never filled. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">https://collections.ushmm.org May 8, 2013 But anyways, he — he applied to stay in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and he was hoping to bring us all there, at least to sit out the — the — the war, because he knew that if he couldn’t get back two ways, I mean there was no reason for us to — to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So he applied here f— as a matter of fact, there’s a man by the name of Yrin, who does genealogy in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , y-r-i-n. And one day, from the blue, he contact me, because this — a second name in my last name is Efron, and he was making a history of the Efrons. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And he asked me about it, and — and he seems to have found, in the Springfield repository of the national archives, actually first papers from my mother, myself and — and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But first papers, we never got the visa.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  So the problem was that he was about to — to be deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And somebody told him that in <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span> , if he showed a certain amount of money, you could get an investors visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So, since he had a — he came with a considerable amount of money to set up this business, there was no problem with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">He — he — he sira — he — he presented his papers, he — he — he put in — he — he showed them the deposit in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and so forth, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And I understand there was a — a— a problem with — with telegrams and God knows what, but basically he got the — the visa about two days before he was going to be deported from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So he traveled by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to the <span class="DLF">border</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Laredo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And this was June. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">May 8, 2013

<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  Well, my cousin — my cousin is a— was a strange person. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">She was a strange person to the day that she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">She was a rebel, of the worst sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I mean, as a child she had joined Hashomer Hatzair in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> , which was not considered very — very Jewish, among the better — better members of the community, because they were the poorest of the poor, and the — the — they were definitely communistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">So, she had joined the Hashomer Hatzair, and of course, she in see — she was the only one that was living in the — 1-in a decent housing area, all the meetings were held in her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and my uncle used to absolutely blow his top. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">But it passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And she was like that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">She went to — to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and when the Germans invaded, she — she — she was part of the Czech underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">She basically spoke very good German, and she looked German. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">She — she was blonde, blue eyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Blue eyed to the point of gray eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So she made friends in the German occupation forces, and she got herself a job as the doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">She — she was still a medical student, but she was in her process of getting her internship, whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">So she was able to get May 8, 2013 herself a job at the <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo jail</span> in — in — in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , and she became the conduit between the people which were being held at the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , and the underground and their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And she did this til 1941, the Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">The <span class="BUILDING">university</span> was closed, I think in November of 1938, because of strikes, student strikes. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">But she — she remained there, and she became an important cog 1n the communications system of the underground, with these people, until — until the end of 1941, when she suspected that she was compromised. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">In fact, we’ve gone to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> facilities, German files, and it’s a fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I mean, the Germans had her take — they had picked her up several times and let her go. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">But there was a—a record that she had been caught at — as a Jewess not wearing a Jewish yellow Star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">There were several reasons that she had been picked up, because she had managed to — she — she was extremely adroit at getting herself out of trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">As a matter of fact, she got, at one point, papers, which Mr. Mousekopf(ph) didn’t know it, but they were of a communist girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And guess what? </span><span class="sentence" id="271">The Germans had her on the list of — of people that they — they had to — so she came — she was taken to <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> , she was taken to the Gestapo head. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And she walks into her <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> — into his <span class="INT_SPACE">office</span> , and she sees a picture behind his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> of Bialystok. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So he — she didn’t let him say hello, it’s just — she says, you know, ho-how did you ever have this picture of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So he says, well, you know, I was stationed there, I wasMay 8, 2013 the head of the Gestapo in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So how — how were you related to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="276">She says, well, I— I belong to the German population of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> , which — which were <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> owners, and my father was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> owner. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And this is how I know <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bialystok</span> very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">My — my — my parents were still there for a while, I don’t know where they are now, because the general — Generalgouvernement is not very informative as to where people are. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So, you know, he made — she made a friendship, and when she walked in, she was about to be sent to wherever — God knows [indecipherable] was sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">She managed to walk out four hours later. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And she managed also to — this false paper that she had, she managed to give it a certain aura of credibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">In other words, you know, he asked her, well, how come you are a communist? </span><span class="sentence" id="283">She says, you know, these were things of when you are a young ma — person, you — you think of other people, and this and that, and not of yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">But this is something which is — which is gone past. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So she managed to — to survive this way, on this set of papers, for close to three — three — well, more than that, she — she — she crossed the — the — she’s crossed into <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> from — from the <span class="COUNTRY">Czech Republic</span> , from the other half, the night of Christmas of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">They figured that, and figured correctly that the German guards would be all drunk, having a Christmas party, and there was a huge snowstorm that night, but they managed to cross into <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Into <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , they already had Mr. Mousekopf(ph) to help May 8, 2013 her, and she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nitra</span> from late 1941 to early 1944, til practically August, September of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">She — she had joined also, the Slovakian underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">There was a Slovakian uprising, I think in August — July or August of 1944, which was the reason that the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">They felt that the Slovakians couldn’t handle this, so they came in, and they cleaned out the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to their liking. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">My cousin, curiously enough, could have survived, but again, she — principle was — used to get her, and this time it got her, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Was basically she — she — she tells that she was picked up by the Germans, taken to the Gestapo headquarters, and sat down with a group of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And this man that she knew in the Gestapo walked in, and says, what are you doing sitting there? </span><span class="sentence" id="294">You’re not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">Go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So she got up and went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and she describes it as having had a terrible night. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I mean, considering that the rest of the Jewish population was being done to something, and deported, or whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So she basically walked in the next morning, into Gestapo headquarters and said, you know, you’re looking for Jews, I’m Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">The man was floored. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">He never in his wildest dream imagined her to be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">She was about as far physically from being a Jew as — as — as you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Of course, didn’t — this didn’t help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But she helped other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">She took Mr. Mousekopf’s(ph) wife and daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">She — she — she was able to — she went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , and in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , Mr. Mousekopf’s(ph) wife and daughter were — were in that same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Mr.May 8, 2013 Mousekopf(ph) had been actually — was able to hide with some — some Catholic priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And she — she told the people at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> that she was a surgeon, she was a —a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So there was a shortage of doctors, not only for — for the inmates, but for actually the general population outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So she was transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross-Rosen</span> , which was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">satellite camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And she said that she needed assistants. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">She was put in charge of a group of 200 agriculture workers, that were working in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross-Rosen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So she said that, you know, she needed assistants. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">So she got the wife and daughter of — of this man Mousekopf(ph) to be her assistants, and all — all three survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And she — she not only — she was actually taken by the camp commandant to his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">northern Germany</span> , to see his mother, who was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And she says she could have stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I mean, they liked her, they — they fed her, they — they clothed her, they — and — and they were very interested for her to stay around, because the mother seemed to be better with her being around. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But she felt a responsibility, curiously enough, for those 200 people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross-Rosen</span> , so she went back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and she stayed there til liberation, til — til May — May of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Of course, we — we — we found out about her almost immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">As liberation occurred, she was able to communicate with us, and we asked what happened to Mother and Father, and she says, we don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I lost total communications with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I spoke to Vera(ph) the last time, which was May 8, 2013 end of 19 — 1939, early 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And she — you know, she told us the whole story, but we were — and my father actually came back, and believe it or not, paid — returned the money to the company that had been given out for my cousin, not for the other — well, the others worked at the company. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But he felt that, you know, property pro — propriety was important.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Forty-one?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  — well, th-that was also a confusing issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">First, my father kept writing sa — horrible letters about <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span> , you know, poverty, dirt, this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">My father — my mother said, you know, what are you trying to do to me? </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I mean, I’m perfectly happy here. </span><span class="sentence" id="351"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> is a nice, clean <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , with no problems of any — any sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So, basically, I actually think that somebody — a — a general, or maybe even a <span class="DLF">field</span> https://collections.ushmm.org May 8, 2013 marshal — I mean, the German army, who was the buyer for the cloth for the German army, came to talk to my mother, and he told her, look, this is no — no time for a Jew to be in — in — in Europe, and you know the — this will take a year, two years, and everything will be settled again, everything will come into its normal course, and you’ll come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">But at this point, this is no point — no time to — for a Jew to be in — in — 1n Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Convinced her. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">The next problem was how to — how to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">My father had arranged for her to — to take Verlichs(ph) out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trieste</span> — th-the ship out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trieste</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , there were two problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">First of all, she c- couldn’t — she — she — it was very difficult to get a transit visa to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , which I think she finally got. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">But before she could leave, Mussolini got into the war, so that cut it off. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Next thing is how to go when there — there were a lot of Jewish refugees who went to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">In other words, they — they took the Trans- Siberian to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vladivostok</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vladivostok</span> to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> , or if not, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vladivostok</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Osaka</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , and from there to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Francisco</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So she figured that that made sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I mean, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> has a <span class="DLF">border</span> with — with <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , and she hadn’t seen her mother for, I don’t know, 30 years, or 25 years, 30 years, so she would do both things. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">So she started to get a— a — a Russian visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">She actually went to the Russian consul, and she applied, and she left, and — and obviously the consul was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And he came running after her, and he told her, look, I can give you a May 8, 2013 visa, I can guarantee that you can get into the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I cannot guarantee that you will be allowed to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So my mother, you know, advice to the wise — wise, you only give once. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So she tried then, going out through — through <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , through — well, there were several problems in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">First of all, the Mexicans did not wish to give her the visa on anything but the Polish passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And the Cubans wouldn’t give her a transit visa either on — except on the Polish passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">She still had the valid Polish passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I mean, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> didn’t exist, but she still had a valish por — Polish pa — of course, here the problem came to the rest of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">I mean, <span class="NPIP">place</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like unoccupied France. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">To them <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> doesn’t — did not exist anymore.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  So, you couldn’t — you know, you can’t travel through us with that Polish passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">So my father’s company, since they had such good relationship with the — with the Hungarian government, managed to get, for my mother, a [indecipherable] passport, a League of Nations passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So, well she — she got herself into, you know, this is a complication. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">First you couldn’t — at that time you couldn’t travel with two passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So one had to be very well hidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">So basically, she was — 1-1t took her a good six months, or seven months, to get all the transit visas there. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">The German transit visa through all — through then <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , German May 8, 2013 <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and you had to go through <span class="REGION">southern Germany</span> , through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miinsing</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , to the <span class="DLF">Swiss border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And then you went across <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , and then you took a — a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vichy</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> to [indecipherable] in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">The — the most difficult visa of them all was the — was the French, the [indecipherable] government visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">She managed to — to get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">She — she was a very strong woman, and she wouldn’t take no for an answer, so she managed to get everything together by about February of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">And we left for — for <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , and traveled through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">We managed to — to be in men — min — Miinsing, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> the night of the — of the speech of Hitler in the — in the beer — beer stuben(ph), in the beer — beer hall. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And the British were bombing, and you know, being in the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> during a bombing 1s the wrong <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Anyways, noth — they did not bomb there. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">They were trying to get Hitler, so they bombed all of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , except for the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">We got out of there, we got into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , we had to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> almost two weeks, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And then we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> was another problem, because <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> — this was the end of the civil war, and th-there was no food in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">So we were given the privilege to live in — in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , which the Spanish government had for foreign dignitaries, which was not far from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Prado</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So we stayed there til — til the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that we were supposed to take, arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vigo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vigo</span> , we had a — a bad May 8, 2013 experience there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">My mother was a type which when she traveled, took everything with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And imagine traveling to war torn Europe with 22 pieces of luggage, including two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamer trunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">She managed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I mean no ha — anyways, in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , she made a — a terrible mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">She met a Hungarian, and she said, you know, I worry about this and that and the other thing, because I took everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I took my silver, I took my jewels, I took this, I took that, and everything is packed away in these 22 bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">So sure enough, it was a terrible mistake, because the guy went and spoke to the — to the Spanish customs. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And we were already on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and suddenly Spanish customs come up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and hold the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and they want to see my mother’s bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">So they started opening bags, and my sister, in all innocence, she had a bar of chocolate, that we brought from <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and she offered it to the — to the inspector, to the Spanish customs inspector, you know, as a courtesy. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Here, would you like to have this? </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Obviously the man hadn’t seen a bar of chocolate in God knows when. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">He said, close up everything, we have nothing to do, we’re just holding up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So, you see, we were — we were saved by a bar of chocolate. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">But my mother was, in that sense, you know, very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">She — she used to — people used to tell her, don’t do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">She said, Pll do it, and PI- Vl carry it through, and she — she was able to carry through almost anything that she undertook. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">She — very — very strong personality. </span><span

<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">A-Actually, that was very lucky, because the Mexican insis — wanted to have a Polish passport, but they didn’t trust passports in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So basically, what they used to do 1s, an — and I'll try to get you a copy of that, too, they used to give you a—a—a-—apiece of cardboard, with your picture on it, with a authorization to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">So basically, you didn’t have to have a passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">I-It — it was just shown that the — at the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> , or whatever it is, and the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> , put all the details of the passport in this piece of paper, and Mexican immigration didn’t — the — the problem was, I understand, was <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , because in <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> they wouldn’t give her a transit visa, unless she had — showed a — a Polish passport, and she didn’t want to show it. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So, finally, after a long argument, saying look, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> doesn’t exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="424"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is now <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="426">ANSWER:  And we have no way of getting a— a German passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So with that, and a little consideration, I think helped — helped us get a transit visa to — to <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">So what we did is we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vigo</span> , and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">the boat</span> made a two day stop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">https://collections.ushmm.org May 8, 2013 And in those two days that we stopped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lisbon</span> , my mother was able to pick up the Mexican visa, and she — we’re also able to pick up matzos, because this was — this was Passover time. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">My mother had gotten from the Jewish community there, kosher [indecipherable] of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I have no idea how she carried it though all of Europe, especially through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , because <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> forbade you — one of their — the only th-thing which was forbidden was to take food out of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">There was plenty of food in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , but you couldn’t — you couldn’t export any of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">My mother was able to pull that through, and quite a few chocolate bars, which were our salvation, sooner or later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">QUESTION:  Do you know if you went to <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span> — if the Mexican government knew that you were Jewish when you were getting your visas, or if you were just traveling at —
ANSWER:  The Mexican — the Mexican government at the time was fairly liberal, and it was fairly liberal — this was the time of Lazaro Cardenas. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Lazaro Cardenas was probably the only world leader which was supporting the republic in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And he had given instructions to all of his consulates, to give a-anybody that walked in, you give him a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So, first of all, my father had the la — legal base to request a visa, but otherwise, you would have gotten a visa as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">They — they were extraordinary liberal. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Unfortunately, very few people knew about this, so very few people availed themself of this situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">May 8, 2013
