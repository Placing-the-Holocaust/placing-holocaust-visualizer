<p>ANSWER:  Testing, one, two, testing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">QUESTION:  How about just tell me — introduce yourself and tell us where you’!l — where we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Tell —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Ah, my name is Michael Vogel. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I’m being interviewed by the Holocaust Museum of Washington, D.C. We are at our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at 6531 Sunset Lane, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Indianapolis</span> , <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> of Washington, D.C. We are at our home at 6531 <span class="DLF">Sunset Lane</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> We are at our home at <span class="DLF">6531 Sunset Lane</span> , Indianapolis, Indiana.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  All right, that’ ll work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Is— am I coming through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  You’re coming through fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">The one thing I’m going to do is just tilt this slightly. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">There we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">What they’ve asked me to do is before we get started talking about your life since coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> is — there are a f — there were a few gaps in the video interview that you did almost 10 years ago, and there were a — a short list of things that they wanted me to ask about, to clarify certain —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  The spelling and stuff?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  Well, that separately, you got that list.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  That — that’s something we can do at the end of the interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  But there were a couple of specific things that they wanted me to ask you that pertained to details regarding stories that you told before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  So, I’d like to start with those and then move into your life since the war ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  In your previous interview you mentioned that on the — the march from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> </p>
<p>ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">That several guards asked the prisoners to quote, sign that I was good to you, that I gave you bread.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  What did they mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="23">What were they expecting of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Well, I’ve seen it, I’ve seen the paper, I’ve seen the paper in their hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">These were actually Wehrmacht guards by now, so most of the SS guards ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">But as we were marching with these Wehrmacht guards, from the lans — last concentration camp, which was a subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , which was a subcamp of Dachau, Landsberg, we were supposedly marching towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Tyrolean mountains</span> , and they knew the ne — end was near. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Of course we — we had — we had to push a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> behind us so if anybody fell, that was just throw ‘em in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , so nobody was — be left on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And this piece of pa — they wrote these pieces of paper and they tried to give it to the persons on the end, on the edge as they were marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Here, would you mind — would you sign this for me, and tell them that I was good to you, that I helped you, that I gave you some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Some people did sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I’ve seen some people sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Wha-Wha-What — what could a poor — poor soul do? </span><span class="sentence" id="33">In the — they never came to me personally, but I’ve seen them being done. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So this was the death march, so to speak a death march because lot of people were — were falling like flies. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I was one of the fortunate ones, I was still strong enough because of — of the slave labor that I performed prior to that, of eating a little better. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So, during this death march there was also a American Air Force air raid on a munition depot very close to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wiirzburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> <span class="BUILDING">munition depot</span> very close to a town called Wiirzburg, Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And from there as the — th — as the Americans were bombing, I ran and I successfully escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And soon after I was picked up by the United States Armed Forces.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  Th-Th-The questions I’m going to ask you in the next few minutes are very disparate, they’re — they’re — they’re not in chronology necessarily, but they’re, again, picking up on things that you mentioned before. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Did you ever get over your fear of doctors and dentists? </span><span class="sentence" id="41">You referred to that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  Unfortunately not. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I — from day — from — ever since I’ve been out of the — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> — when I met my wife, I got married, I had — I had problem with my teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">You know, there — there is saying, your teeth are alright, but your gums have to come out, and that was my case, and I was deathly afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Once — I once ran away from a dentist in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I don’t know if I ever s — mentioned that to — to — to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I was taken by another — another G.I. with — to — to go to the dentist because I had awful ba-bad teeth and pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And I was sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> and I ran away from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I’m still scared of dentists, I’m still deathly afraid of shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Pll tell you an — a little story about what happened to me a few years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">As I mentioned to you before, I wa — I was involved in soccer, not only as a coach and a referee, but as a player. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">I was playing a soccer game and I got hit by a man and he opened my f— my forehead. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I ended up in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And a friend of mine, the one I showed you on the picture in — in the <span class="DLF">wall</span> there, took me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and then they called my wife to come to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They wanted to give me a tetanus shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I would re — I refused it, I would — I fought it. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">My wife almost left me because of that, she was so upset with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">That tetanus shot was so important because I was hit, and also hit a <span class="DLF">door</span> , and the hor — <span class="DLF">door</span> had a little steel [indecipherable] I was — and doctors fear is still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">When I go to examination, I am awfully fearful what they going to do to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Very much so, even today. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I’m afraid of when they look for po — prostrate, you know, when they do th — do that little finger job on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">That scares me, that scares the hell out of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">When they take a little blood from the fingers, that scares me. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So that fear is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , unfortunately, because I’ve seen Mengele e-e-every day on th —on-—on the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So the doctors always scare me, and they shouldn’t, they really shouldn’t, not today. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And especially since I have a daughter who is a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But I’m still afra — a-afraid of it. ’</span><span class="sentence" id="68">m very much so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Have you ever made any efforts to do anything about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Have you —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  N-No. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">See, there are two things that I am afraid of. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Doctors and dentists is two, and I’m also afraid of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Water scares me for the simple reason because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I was sent to a shtraf(ph) commander once. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Shtraf(ph) commander meaning that they caught me es — organizing food for Jewish girls [indecipherable] commando, and they send you to a sin 0-0-operation, so they call it shtraf(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Sin — sin — sin commando, which meant that we were forced to cut seaweeds in water. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We had a chain — chainsaw like, but with the one guy on one end of it, the other one the other end, gonna pull it, was like a sickle, which would cut it. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And there would be a kapo(ph) — a—a [indecipherable], a kapo(ph), a — a person who was in charge of us behind us with the SS man, and they would dunk our heads in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and kept us there until we could not breathe any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So I — I— I went through that for a couple of weeks as a — a-a-as a shtraf commander, as a sin [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So whenever — whenever we go to a <span class="DLF">beach</span> or something, I only go up to my knees. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And not one of my children, of the four kids, were swimmers, because of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And of course, now they are learning a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Some of them are — a couple of them are still afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Arsani’s(ph) a swimmer now, his ti— his children are a swimmer. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Our daughter the physician, she swims now, she was always deathly afraid of water, because of the — because of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So those are the things that scare me, scare the hell out of me, doctors, dentists and water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Makes sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I’m gonna re-rearrange the microphone so it’s a little less bothersome for you and you can move around better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Can you —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  It’s fine, it’s -- that just gives you a little more free reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Oh, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Although it’s off s — the chronology a little bit here, I would like t — well, I’Il come back to this, th-the — how you think — what you — how you think your children have been affected by what happened to you is something I would like to talk to you about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Do you — you want to talk to me about 1t now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Well —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  All right, we’re there, so let’s — let’s —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  All right, let’s — the children, our children. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Well, when I arrived to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , May 10", 1946, I came from the army, so it was a little different for me than the most survivors that arrived here, because most survivors came on a diff —in a—1-ina—ina different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I was helped with the United States armed forces and also was very helpful that I had an aunt living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So when I first met my wife, my future wife, we started dating, we — also a survivor, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">She didn't have much family, I didn’t have any family, so you lonely, I’m lonely, let’s be lonely together, the old saying what is the — one survivor said it at one time, if I may use his phrase. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So when we got married, February 22", 1948, it will be 50 years coming up in the next — th-this February, I asked my wife, why don’t we — let’s not talk any more any other language except English. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">My English was fairly decent except I had the ar-army language, which was not the cleanest language in those days, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">That’s how I learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And we decided — she was a little bit against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">She said no, we should talk to the children other languages also. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">She was much smarter than me, believe me, because the kids today could have — although they speak some languages, but they could — today they could have learned much more. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So, how did it affect my children? </span><span class="sentence" id="105">First, we wouldn’t talk about our experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Another mistake we made — I made, anyway, it was — I’m — I’m taking the blame for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Reason we didn’t want to, why hurt them? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Why let them know how much we suffered, how much we went through? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But the kids knew they were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Our children soon, as soon as they started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> found out they were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Number one, they didn’t have any first cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">They didn’t have any aunts and uncles. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">No grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">There was never a grandmother to — to — to hug them and kiss them or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="115"><span class="BUILDING">School</span> functions, for parent and grandparents, there were never any grandparents around. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We used to adopt grandparents for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> we use to a-adopt a lady in the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">She was nice, and th — Grandma Goldstein, that was her grandma. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">She did — she had one daughter, an old, old maid, never married, so our children became her grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So the kids were — knew they — and yet they knew, they knew why something was wrong, but we never talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">The only time the kids would — our son was the first one, who was the oldest. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">When I joined this soccer team in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> , which by the way was founded by German Jews who arrived to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in the 30’s, just before Hitler got to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And I joined this team and pretty soon — there was a tryout — pretty soon there were more survivors joining this team. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So after soccer games we would go to someone’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , yours, mine or someone else’s and had a cookout or dinner, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We would start talking about the game, then we would start talking about our lives in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , how — how are we doing, how much money do you make. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And before you knew it, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> would come to the — to — into the — into the conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And our children, especially our son, would always listen from be — from behind the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And — and he knew — he — then he would tell his sisters, you know, I just heard something about Daddy, or I heard something about Mom, about what ha — what happened to them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">So we didn’t want to talk about these experiences to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And ar — then, let me tell you about the — the — the — the local Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="131"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> is a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">metropolitan city</span> with a large Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We, Agnes and I, my wife Agnes went to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to learn English. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I — at the Jewish Community Center in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Detroit</span> <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> in Detroit, and our soccer team will also meet there. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So, I didn’t go to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because I—I-—I-I felt I— I had enough of schooling, which was another mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Would have listened to my wife I probably would have been sometime a teacher today somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So we — then we tried to tell the local population, the local Jewish population, our — our own people in — in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We had a Purim play, we went to a Purim play, and then all of a sudden we start talking to these people about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , no — number of us in the soccer team. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And the leader of the group says, that’s enough about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Let’s go back to singing and playing the music again. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So nobody want to listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">My own aunt, may she rest in peace, my father’s youngest sister, who lost everybody in her family, she lost two sisters, she lost her brother, she lost all her nieces and nephews and — and — and — and all her cousins, she wouldn’t — she, coming in 1939, emigrating to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in 1939 from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , she didn’t want to listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So we decided not to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The first time I was able to talk about it was when our youngest daughter asked my wife to come to her eighth grade <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> to speak, and the next day my wife forced me to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Yet, I didn’t tell them a story like the story should be told. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I kind of whitewashed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I was afraid to hurt people. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So that took a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So my children, at f— at first they were resentful, they said Daddy, why didn’t you tell us? </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Why — you know, th — they didn’t come and — and say to me, you — you — you were wrong, you — you should have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But you could have told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I didn’t want to hurt you honey. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">This — this is simple, it’s a — it the 0 — it’s the way it is, I'd — it just — I don’t want to hurt strangers, let alone my own children. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So they’re different. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But today they’re very much involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">My daughter, the oldest one, the physician was on the Holocaust Committee with me, which I am a chairman of [indecipherable] local — local Holocaust Committee called Jewish Committee Relations. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Both — all three of the daughters went to second generation meetings, second generation of Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">In ninete — January 27, 1985, I took two of my children, my son and my middle daughter, the New Yorker, the jeweler, with me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for the commemoration of the 40" anniversary of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> being liberated, if you can call being liberated by the Soviet Union a liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And they came there. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I showed them, first of all Auschwitz number one, that was the first camp that I was taken to. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I showed them the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> that my father was last taken to, block seven in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> <span class="DLF">block seven</span> in Auschwitz, called the Krankenbau, the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161"><span class="INT_SPACE">Sick bay</span> without doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">I showed them that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">This is where they took my — your grandfather last time, to the ovens from. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I showed them block 16 where I s — where I was living on the — which by the way, block 16 today in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> <span class="BUILDING">block 16</span> where I s — where I was living on the — which by the way, <span class="DLF">block 16</span> today in Auschwitz is the <span class="DLF">Czechoslovakian block</span> , a-a-and they have some artifacts in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And we spend there a couple da — two days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And then of course in 1990, I went back again to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but this time I took agn — took Agnes with me, the same middle daughter and the youngest daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">This 1s where we made a film called, “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , If You Cried, You Died.” </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So I sh — there I really pored my heart out to my children, to show them what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is all about, what it was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I took them to every — see I was working as a slave laborer, a place called Kanada commando, unloading incoming Jews from every — every Nazi occupied European country. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And this is where I gave my two daughters and my wife, who has not been to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , their exact feeling what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was about. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I explained to them <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> one — crematorium one, which is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> <span class="BUILDING">crematorium one</span> , which is in Auschwitz number one, which 1s still standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , which is the Auschwitz number two camp, and I showed them the crematorias(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I worked as a slave laborer at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , 600 yards from the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span>

<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  They didn’t know what to do with us, until the medical groups came when they finally decided that that’s not the way to treat them. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And then, of course, then they opened the displaced person camps, and which I was not part of ba — part of one, but — and I’ve seen <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced person camps</span> , and let me tell you, I’m glad I wasn’t a part of one, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced person camps</span> were just like camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">They were not like Nazi — End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B</p>
<p>QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Michael Vogel. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">This is tape number one, side B. And as the tape was ending you were explaining that because of malnourishment, that when you would — when the G.Ls in their — in their well-meaning way would give you food that was too rich for you and in too large quantities and that it — your bodies couldn’t handle it. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">What was it like for you when they first gave you food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  Well, when I was picked up at the United States forces, and — and the <span class="INT_SPACE">field kitchen</span> was operating, you — you — they had all <span class="INT_SPACE">field kitchens</span> , I don’t know if you know what a <span class="INT_SPACE">field kitchen</span> is, but it’s an <span class="INT_SPACE">army unit kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And they tried to f — they fed me too, and I had a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">The first thing 1s, the food went right through me. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And I was very fortunate, we had a medic on — with us, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">medical unit</span> with us, and they gave me some — some — some coal tablets, you know, charcoal tablets to stop — stop my — my — my — my — my —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Diarrhea?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">ANSWER:  Diarrhea. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And one of the doctors tried to s-say di — don’t give him so much food, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Of course that’s easy for — for him to say don’t give me so much food, because he didn’t stand in the <span class="DLF">chow line</span> wi — like I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I had a [indecipherable] on the <span class="DLF">chow line</span> and I piled it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Of course, it got better with me, I was one of the fortunate ones for this reason, because I was a Kanada worker, I was also in a better physical shape than the other prisoners were. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So I had a little more. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Although I had swollen eyes and swollen feet and swollen hands from malnutrition, but I was not as bad off as the other ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So it took less time for me to digest — to — to — to — to be able to digest the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And it took awhile, I would say it took a couple of weeks at least, but I was always hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I was always the first one in the <span class="DLF">chow line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And then I st — then, of course, put me to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , see, and I was working you n — in — in the <span class="INT_SPACE">mess kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">So that was even better. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And we had a — we had a cook, this mess sergeant, I don’t know if you know what a mess sergeant is. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">That’s the guy who 1s 1n charge of the army ki-kitchen. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">He has cooks under him. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">His name was sad sack, they used to call him sad sack. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And he would kind of take care of me and we used to — he used to go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and — and we used to — he-he was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Furth</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , f-u-r-t-h, which is a s— a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">But I found out of course, many years later, Henry Kissinger came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Furth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And he would go to this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , go to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , steal a few chickens, steal some fresh milk and bring them back to the G.Ls, bring them back to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And we had fresh eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Normally we used to have powder eggs, the army powder eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And he would take me with him in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> and we would go organize. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">The reason he took me with him, because I spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">For a couple of cigarettes he would get anything he wanted in a <span class="DLF">farm</span> — <span class="BUILDING">farm place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">So for me it’s — didn’t take as long to get down to the system where I could eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">QUESTION:  What other physical problems did you have once they — you were there with the army”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">ANSWER:  Well, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , my fingers and my toes were frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So, I had very poor circulation in my — in my hands, in my feet, my blood circulation. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And when I was examined, which I can show you, when I was sworn into the United States Armed Forces, when I was examined by the medical group of — in the army, they did find a little — they don’t put it down there as much, but they found some wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I had cracked fingers, my fingers opened up because of the froze — ba — frostbite and same thing with my toes. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">My — all my hair fell off from my legs, and that was because the blood circulation was poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And my fingers, even to this date, when it s — gets real cold, tips of my fingers get white, even with gloves on. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">So that was one medical problem I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Other than that, I didn’t have too many problems, medical problems, except being afraid of doctors and not going to one and probably if I would have gone to doctors and they would have possibly gave me some sort of mediation to — to — to make me better, I probably would have been better. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">But I— I — I healed quite fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  Did the G.I.s there, did they ask you about what had happened to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Were they —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I found some of them that got to be interested much later. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">See, when I was with — picked up by the army, last days of ni — o-of March 19 twe — 1945, first part of ma — April. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">April 6, 1945, President Roosevelt died, and I was already in with this unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">74 — 774 tank battalion, and I remember over the army radio system came the news and everybody was so hushed up about it, so you know, President Roosevelt died. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">That was April 6", 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And by then I was getting, you know, much better. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">So some of the boys after the war, May 8", 1945, some of the boys — I found a couple of Jewish boys in the sa — 1n the unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">One would not eat un-kosher food, so he was given special — special food. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And this guy wanted to know more, a little bit more about it, and since he found out that most of the Jews were murdered in Europe, so he started asking me the questions, so I would talk to him a little bit about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Then, was a chaplain there also, and the chaplain would ask, but very few people really cared, because you know, here were these young boys, 19 — 20 — 21 years old boys away from those — 4,000 miles away from their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they would sing [sings] I'll be <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for Christmas, 1945, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Or singing that type of song and worrying about one thing only, letters from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Mail call was the biggest thing in the world because you were late — letter from your mom, from your girlfriend, from your brothers, from your sisters and this was the big thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I was a small fry. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Here I was, a Jewish boy who survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> they knew nothing about. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And not only they knew nothing about, some of them could care less. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">To them a crap game was more interesting than my story, which I didn’t tell, to certain groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">I tell you, this Jewish guy, a Sephardic Jew, is a— came from a Spanish type of family, and he was very much interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">He was a religious person and he wanted to know what ha — why did the Jew — why did they do it to Jews, he would ask me. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">I wish I could tell you why they do it — did it to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">But the Jews were the one earmarked for ba — to be — to be murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And he was the only one that I would conver — oh, and the teacher, sorry, Feldman, who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">He was another one, he wanted to know what happened, because his parents and his grandparents came from somewhere in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But other than that most of them get a furlough to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to have a good time with the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">That was the main thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Get a weekend pass, or go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">We were stationed then still in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but on the way from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> towards <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , because this unit, 770 — 774 tank battalion, these boys had enough points — and let me explain what the points were. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Points were, if you served in service that such and such — long time, you were given points for each month. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And if you were married and had family, that was extra points, so you could come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Now this bat-battalion, 774 tank battalion was ready to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in September 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Now here they go from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> we going towards <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">We ended up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp called</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Lucky Strike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">Camp Lucky Strike, the ne — Holocaust Museum has a photograph of me in the Camp Lucky Strike, in a tent picture, I’m — I’m in a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Lucky Strike</span> , the ne — Holocaust Museum has a photograph of me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Lucky Strike</span> , in a tent picture, I’m — I’m in a tent over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Outside a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> , I’m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And now we come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaHavre</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And here’s an interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">I’m sure I told this to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , but I’m going to repeat it if I — 1f I did, so I’]l repeat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="452"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaHavre</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was an embarkation, it was the — this ab — th — where the camp — embarkation camp, this is where you got on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">embarkation camp</span> , this is where you got on ships to go back home. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Now here is my unit going on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> called Lieutenant Colonel James Barker. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">That’s the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop carrier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">The na — that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> is named after this colonel. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Now they don’t know what to do with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">They wanted to put me on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and I’m ready to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I would be going on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> with them to go to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Well, Captain Yogerling(ph), who is an attorney from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> says, we’re gonna get him in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">What they wanted to do, the other captain wanted to do, take him — go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , to — tha-that was our — the — they would stop in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , we would get discharged in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , get our — get our papers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , and then leave for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Get our papers and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Discharge papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Well, Captain Yogerling(ph) felt 1f I’m going to be put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> — the other captain said, let’s take him on with us, put him on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and when we get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , turning him in to the authorities, to <span class="BUILDING">immigration office</span> , and tell them he’s got an aunt here he — he can go to his aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Now, Captain Yogerling(ph), who is an attorney from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , this is nuts, this is illegal entry to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and he will be punished, he will — he will be sent — sent back to where — wherever they send him back. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">So Captain Yogerling(ph) decided un — took me on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> , with my duffle bag — and the guys collected money. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">The — the — my group, company A, which I was with, they collected dollars to give me, you know, to — so I have some money with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">They took me — Captain Yogerling(ph) drove me to Camp Home Run, which was — that was the name of the camp, which was an embarkation camp, but I’m going to tell you what the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">embarkation camp</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Home Run</span> , which was — that was the name of the camp, which was an embarkation camp, but I’m going to tell you what the camp meant — may be an embarkation. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Replacement troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">This is what the troops will be coming to replace the troops that went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And I went to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Home Run</span> , the Captain Yogerling(ph) took me with him, took me to the camp commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And the camp commander kind of welcomed me, they got — they stuck me with the name Chesskey(ph), you know, that was the — that was given to me already by this unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Captain Yogerling(ph) said that’s what they call him, Chesskey(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So I got into this camp, and what I be gi — what kind of job they give me? </span><span class="sentence" id="474">To be in charge of a officer’s dry cleaning and laundry, manned by German prisoners, all right? </span><span class="sentence" id="475">First thing the captain of — of — of Home Run, Captain Home Run tells me who was in charge of us in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">He says to me, Chesskey(ph), you’re going to be working, you’re going to be in charge of this laundry. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">Now, there are German prisoners there. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">We didn’t come here to make <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , we came here to bring democracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And that’s what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I was there, I was sworn into the United States Armed Forces at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Home Run</span> with another fellow, whose name is also misspelled on the list you have, whose name was Raymond Delafonte(ph) Quinones(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="481">He was a Spaniard, not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Now we sworn into United States Armed Forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">However, it was a wrong form, a regular army form. </span><span class="sentence"
