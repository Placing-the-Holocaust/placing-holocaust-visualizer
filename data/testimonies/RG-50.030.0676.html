<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Did they die before you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  They did not die before I was born, but you see, my parents were married in 1932 and moved to the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> where I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And my grandparents -- my maternal grandparents remained in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and my paternal grandmother was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhineland</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  So how long had your family lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Oh, I believe since -- the only thing I know, way back in the 1800s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about your home life before you had to leave in 1935”? </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Can you tell me a little bit about what life was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Well, what I remember, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I was born in 1933, and we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So I was two years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And I don't -- I don't remember too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My father was in the shoe business and director of a <span class="BUILDING">shoe factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My mother was a homemaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And we went for walks. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">My dad carried me on his shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And that's about what I remember except that I know at one point we had to move out of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> because they found out we were Jewish and had to find another <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to move into.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit more about that, either from what you remember or what you've learned, why you had to move out, when you had to move out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Well, as I said, I was born in 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">That's when Hitler came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And my father was allowed to stay at the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="33">He was managing director of a <span class="BUILDING">shoe manufacturing company</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He was allowed to stay awhile because he had connections in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to where the merchandise was exported. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And you see, his father had fought in World War I and never returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  So did that allow him certain privileges?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  Yes, until 1935 when the SS demanded his dismissal. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And that's when we were asked to move out of our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And we managed to find another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And shortly thereafter my father left for <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> , where he started a business with a gentleman that he knew, and my mother and I followed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  Do you happen to know how you found the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in 1935, how you got --
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  -- from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I think they just -- my parents just went looking and asking, but that's all I know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  And tell me a little bit about how your family was first affected by anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">You started talking about that a little bit with your father's dismissal. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Can you elaborate on that a little bit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">He was just asked to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He said that the owner said, "I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">The SS 1s demanding your dismissal. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We don't want any Jews working for us." </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And that's about all I can remember about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">As I said, I was only two years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything about when your father left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Iremember my father leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And he left -- I think he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> through <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And then -- but he often went on business trips. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">He went to <span class="REGION">Sicily</span> on business. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">He often -- and to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And so I guess at the time, as far as I can remember, I just felt, Well, he's either going to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- but we did -- my mother said, "We have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">They don't want us here any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">We're going to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to meet Dad in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> ."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  Do you have any other early memories of living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mannheim</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Not really, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And I haven't been back there since.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  What do you remember about the journey to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  Well, I remember my mother and I taking the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And I don't even remember arriving in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , but I just remember parts of times while we were living there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  Well, my father, as I say, went into business with this gentleman. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And we lived in -- we had a very nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And I always remember going downstairs to see -- the manager of the <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> lived downstairs with his wife, and I always remember going down there and having a few meals. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And my mother used to get angry because I wouldn't eat at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I was a very picky eater. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And I remember having my tonsils out and coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , being in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And I remember my father sitting by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and he was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">He cried very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">He was a very sentimental person. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And then I remember lots of walks we took in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He always carried me on his shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I remember a time being in a sort of a <span class="BUILDING">nursery school</span> with a nun, and we went on a walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">They took us out to take us somewhere in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I don't remember where. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And then my mother and father coming for me and taking me out of -- I was being among the other kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Taking me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">They said, "Come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">We have to go." </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And that's about all I remember about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  And when were you in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="91">From 1935?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  From 1935 to 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  Do you remember any anti-Semitism in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I just remember my parents saying that -- about Mussolini. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">They were collecting all the gold from people, even their wedding bands. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And so they bought themselves, I think, stainless steel wedding bands andhid theirs so they wouldn't have to give them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And I remember that much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  So how would you characterize your childhood up to this point, up to 1939?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  Up to 1939? </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Well, I suppose it was fairly normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">That's when we left <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , when it started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">QUESTION:  Tell me about how and when you left <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">ANSWER:  Well, in 1939 or in 1938 -- I'm sorry -- all immigrant Jews were asked to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">This is when Mussolini and Hitler became close. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And we didn't know, of course, where to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And we didn't want to return to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and we could not obtain affidavits to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">My parents had cousins and distant relatives, but they were bringing their own families over, so they couldn't do anything for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So my father, who had business acquaintances in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> still dating back to when he was working in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , called them, and he procured a position in a <span class="BUILDING">shoe factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So we gave away -- we gave up all of what we had because we had to leave our possessions, most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And we took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lugano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And there a gentleman accompanied us across the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zurich</span> we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> and we were denied entry because we had German passports which had a big Jon them. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And they wanted to send us back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but of course we did not think that was a very good idea, so my father did a little persuading. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And they agreed to let us stay overnight at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> and we would leave the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , but there is a story in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We were waiting for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> to leave, and I had never seen a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> take off. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">This was in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And my father lifted me onto a heat register and didn't realize how hot it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">He sat me on it and burned my dertriere. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And I was very badly burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">But we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And the doctor -- a gentleman noticed that I was very uncomfortable sitting, so he approached my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And he happened to be a doctor from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ViennA</span> : And he and my parents began a conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And he apparently told them to go -- the best thing was to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">He advised my father that the situation for the immigrant Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milan</span> was bad, not to go back there, and to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And he even suggested a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> there where we might stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And we were there for about three weeks and then obtained permission to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Caen</span> , C-A-E-N, for the next six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And now we go to the year of 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">My father joined the French Army, and my mother and I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Caen</span> at a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where she was a waitress. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And very soon thereafter the Germans occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and took over the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So my mother was supposed to be a Swiss citizen because she couldn't speak French by that time and could only speak German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  Was she posing as a Swiss citizen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  She was posing as a Swiss citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And she took me aside and told me -- warned me that if any of the German soldiers approached me and spoke to me, to pretend I didn't understand them, to answer them in French or Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So lo and behold, a German soldier did approach me and asked "Wie heifen Sie?" </span><span class="sentence" id="138">What is your name, in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And I answered, "Je ne comprends pas ce." </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I don't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And he persisted, and another German soldier joined him. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And they were talking between them about the little girl who they left in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And so after a while they let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And I was scared to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Was this in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Caen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  Inthe <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">They were going -- I remember being at the bottom of the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , and the <span class="INT_SPACE">restroom</span> was on the side and they were going to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">restroom</span> and they happened to see me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  And how old were you at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  I was Six.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  So were you already enrolled in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or not yet?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  No, I was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I was not because soon thereafter it was time to flee again. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And this time we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Mans</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">That's capital L-E and then capital M-A-N-S.
QUESTION:  And what caused you to flee?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">ANSWER:  Well, the German occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We were running away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Mans</span> until 1940, until the Germans approached and began bombing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So I guess my father came -- was on furlough from the Army, I don't remember which, but talked to a French citizen who accompanied us across the boarder to what we thought was the unoccupied zone. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">That was southern -- <span class="REGION">southwestern France</span> , to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of Castelmoron-sur-Lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Did you want me to spell all these words, these names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Ifyou can.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  It's C-A-S-T-E-L-M-O-R-O-N, and then next word is S-U-R, and the third name -- word is Lot, capital L-O-T.
QUESTION:  And can you tell me, how did you get from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And all of us were walking very leisurely. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And all of a sudden my mother asked me to go down and make pee pee. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And I responded that I didn't have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And she said again, "Sit down and make pee pee." </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And I said, "I don't have to." </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And finally she slapped me and pushed me down. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And of course, I started to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I was hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">I was -- And then later she explained to me that the Germans from the occupied zone of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> were watching us with their binoculars and we were supposed to make it look like a promenade, a leisurely walk, and not an escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And then the gentleman who was with us led us to the nearest <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And I remember hiding in the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> where tobacco was hanging, hung drying. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And the next two days we slept in <span class="INT_SPACE">stalls</span> and different <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And I remember noises at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">There were rats and mice. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">We had no green card, so we were at the mercy of the farmers who did give us food and shelter. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And we trusted them that they wouldn't turn us in to the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Can you tell me for a moment what you mean by "green card"? </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Do you mean a special transit card?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  I'm using that as an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">As we have green cards here, it was -- I can't think -- an identification card. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Being noncitizens, we had to have identification.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  So you were walking from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  We were walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">And we continued to make our way then to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Castelmoron</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And of course, we had to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And my parents did. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">It was very, very primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">The <span class="DLF">entry</span> was just dirt and had wood to burn in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> , and <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> were upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And there was just one <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and a very primitive <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> with a wood-burning <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">No <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , indoor or outdoor. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We just used a bucket, which had to be emptied every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And my parents got jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">They acquired jobs in a <span class="BUILDING">belt factory</span> , doing assembly work. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And then I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  When you started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , did you have to pose as a non-Jewish child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  You know, I don't -- we were the only Jews in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">The children probably didn't know, but I'm sure their parents knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">People were very, very good to us there. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">There was never anything that I remember said from any of the children, anything derogatory. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And then in 1940 of course the Vichy government came into power, whose leader was Marshal Philippe Pétain. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Capital P-E-T-A-I-N. And of course, he -- his bosses were the Germans, were the SS, the Nazis, even though he had fought against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in World War I. He just turned around completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And from that time I guess until the end of the war, we were hunted. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">We lived underground most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Our neighbors knew we were refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And then the next thing I remember was that my parents told me that they have to leave or they were warned beforehand by a sympathetic official from the police that there would be a house-to-house search and that they had better flee.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  And this was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Castelmoron</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And they left me in the care of the French family who owned the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And of course, they didn't say where they were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I had no idea where they were or when and if I would see them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So I was sent to <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> on Sundays and catechism after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">They told my parents, "Well, if she can't practice her religion, she should have something. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So send her to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and to <span class="BUILDING">catechism</span> ."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about the family who you were hidden with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  Well, they also owned the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And of course, they gave my parents a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So my parents felt that they should listen to them and send me to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And they were very, very sympathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Very nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  And how were you hidden? </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Were you taken in as part of the family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I was like part of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I had no problems, except I was very homesick. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I didn't know when and if my parents would return or when and if I would even see them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">It was months before we were reunited. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And I guess my parents had gone to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where they knew a German-Jewish family who owned a <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And this family had two daughters a little bit older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">As a matter of fact, they had their daughters converted to Catholicism so that their lives would be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">They were -- Both girls were baptized. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So they went into hiding there and I stayed with a French family. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And when I started going to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , my father even bought me the New Testment, prayer book, and a rosary. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">He was not an Orthodox Jew, but he was fairly traditional, so that was an unusual thing for him to do, but then our lives were in question. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So I continued attending <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and catechism. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And then one day the priest approached me about baptizing me, and he mentioned that I needed to have a religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And I responded, I said, "I do have one. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">I'm Jewish." </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And he said, "Well, that's really not a religion, but I have to talk to your father, and he's going to have to convert first." </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">He spoke to my dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And my dad told him, "Father, I'm very sorry," he said, "I'm not a very good Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I'd make an even worse Catholic." </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So that was the end of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">QUESTION:  How did the priest know where your father was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">ANSWER:  Well, my father was -- my parents were back at that time, back from their hiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  And about what year was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  That was sometime, 1940, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">1941 perhaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">There was one <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> , and he was the priest in that <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And we lived in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So he knew where to find my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And that was before my father joined the French Underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And we had no idea where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">He mentioned to us after the war that their job, the Underground, called the French Forces of the Interior, their job was to blow up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German ammunition trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And he did come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> occasionally for a couple of days. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And then in late 1940 -- In 1942 my parents decided to have another child. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I guess it was rumored that the Vichy authorities would not arrest a husband of the Jewish women who were pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And of course, that was all foolishness. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">It wasn't true. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">But my mother at the time was then two months pregnant when the gendarmerie, the French police, came to arrest my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And I remember clearly that they took him from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived, had him remove his belt, and handed him three safety pins to hold up his pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And I heard them say to my mother, "We don't want him to keep his belt. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">He might hang himself." </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And of course, I started screaming, "Please don't take my father away." </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I was nine years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And this 1s an episode which is in my mind always. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And the chief of police was very nice to us, very sympathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And I don't know what would have happened if it hadn't been for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">He told my mother to obtain a letter from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> 's only -- one and only doctor, stating that she was four months pregnant instead of two, and that he would try to have my father released. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And she did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And she did so. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And my father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a couple of days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">But from then on, he was a hunted man. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So my sister and I -- you'll have to forgive me. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I tend to be a little emotional. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">My sister Annie was born in Villeneuve-sur-Lot -- V-I-L-L-E-N-E-U-V-E, next word S-U-R, and the next word capital L-O-T -- on August 5th, 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And this was the nearest -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with the nearest <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">And I was 10 years old and, of course, very excited to have a sibling. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And then my dad was in and out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> or wherever he was with the underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">He would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> once in a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">He left his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> at the next-door neighbor's <span class="DLF">back yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And our <span class="DLF">bedroom window</span> would -- you would go onto the roof of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and then you could jump into the neighbor's <span class="DLF">back yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">On one of his visits in the middle of the night, there was a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">So he quickly jumped out of the <span class="DLF">bedroom window</span> to the adjoining <span class="DLF">yard</span> and took off on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">The authority -- now, this was the French authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I guess they had to do their job, or so they said. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">They came upstairs -- Oh, and what I have to preempt this with was that they had tried to warn us that they had to come and inspect the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And they looked all over, under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And my mother held my two-months-old baby sister and said, "Here, do you want to take her too?" </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So they mentioned they were under the orders of the SS and then they left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  Now, was your father back and forth from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> to your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> through the entire period from 1940 to 1943?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  Do you remember him coming and going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  Coming and going, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And I remember him vividly jumping out the <span class="DLF">bedroom window</span> and onto the <span class="DLF">roof</span> and then going down the <span class="DLF">neighbor's yard</span> on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So I was- every night I laid in my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and I was terrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I knew that they -- that the Germans or the Vichy government were picking up the Jews in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And whenever I heard a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicle</span> during the night I was just trembling. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I was terribly frightened, and I knew they usually came in the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And then about my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> attendance was of course very erratic. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I'd go to attend <span class="BUILDING">class</span> one month and then we went into hiding two or three months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">QUESTION:  Where did you go into hiding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">ANSWER:  In <span class="DLF">farms</span> outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And we had one particular <span class="DLF">farm</span> we always went to where we worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And my -- when my father was not serving with the resistance, he worked on one <span class="DLF">farm</span> while my mother and I and my sister and on another <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And we worked in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">We picked tobacco, tomatoes, potatoes, green beans. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I milked cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I took them to <span class="DLF">pasture</span> and had to tend to them so they wouldn't stray into neighbors' <span class="REGION">property</span> because there were no <span class="DLF">fences</span> anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And the living conditions were also very primitive there. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And no indoor or outdoor facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">You just went out in the <span class="DLF">field</span> and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">In the morning you went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pump</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and you washed face and hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And once a week my mother would heat water in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> or on the wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> and take -- put it into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">galvanized tub</span> , and that was my bath in the middle of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And that was my bath.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION:  And so who was hiding you? </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Were these local farmers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  The farmers. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">The farmers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  And you were moving from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> so that your father wouldn't be found?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">ANSWER:  Well, my father was in a different <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And of course, I still remember the chickens, the ducks, and the pigs and running in and out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> throughout the <span class="BUILDING">farmhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And my poor sister and I were infected with lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">My mother was always working on our hair with kerosene to get rid of the lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And rodents were all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And the only time I really had any fun was during harvest season. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Harvest the grapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">We were in a <span class="REGION">region</span> that's not too far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bordeaux</span> , which 1s a <span class="REGION">wine region</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I'll spell it for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Capital B-O-R-D-E-A-U-X. And then in a couple of months or three months when we thought it was safe, we would return to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and I would resume <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I also -- my husband is reminding me. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">My fun during grape harvest was to get into the barrel with the grapes and stomping on the grapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">That was a lot of fun.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about what year this was that you were going from <span class="NPIP">place</span> to <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Well, this was -- we were doing this off and on until the end of the war in 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  So from 1943 or so?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">ANSWER:  From around 1940 to 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  And of course, when I returned to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I didn't have a very understanding teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I had missed a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And she would give a test. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And of course, I would get a bad grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">But truthfully, my father was not very understanding where <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Where education was concerned, he was extremely strict. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And the only slap on the derriere I ever got from him was when I brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> a fail grade or a bad grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And oftentimes I would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and find my mother waiting with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">baby carriage</span> and off we went to hide again. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">This time my father was hiding with the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And then the word came that the Allies had landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Normandy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And everyone was excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">We could hardly restrain our emotions. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">And my father and his group aided the American troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And then when he returned from one of these missions, he'd bring us powdered milk and toothpaste and chocolate and soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And by the way, during the war we had -- everything was rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">We had coupons for meat, for bread, for everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And my mother used to make her own soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">She used to save all the grease from -- I don't know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Save it and use -- and cook it in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> and then it became hard when it cooled. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And that was soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And then the Allies advanced into our vicinity, and the Germans and Vichy troops left the <span class="REGION">area</span> and we were able to breathe a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And my father was much decorated. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">He got the medal of honor. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And he got the medal of voluntary firer of the resistance as well as the commemorative medal war with clasp of liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">CHK) SEE HIDDEN NOTE -> And by the way, I didn't write this in my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">My father was in Who's Who in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And my father was discharged from military service in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And he accepted the post of tax inspector in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Saar</span> , which is capital S-A-A-R, which is a region between <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">During that time, of course, it was occupied by the French military, and during that time we became French citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about what liberation was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">ANSWER:  Well, everyone was dancing in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of that -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Castelmoron</span> , in that little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">It was just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Especially when Dad came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and he said we survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And after this my dad was appointed director of police for the <span class="REGION">Saar province</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And when his job was -- ended with that, he became a co-owner of a <span class="BUILDING">shoe manufacturing company</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">He had met a gentleman who had the funds, a French gentleman. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And my father had the know-how, so they opened the <span class="BUILDING">shoe factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And we at the time, as I mentioned before, had relatives in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And I was really sick and tired of war-torn Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And I used to read magazines of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I thought at the time that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> was -- literally the <span class="DLF">streets</span> were lined with gold.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  What made you sick and tired of war-torn Europe? </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Was it the conditions? </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Was it the way people were treating you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">ANSWER:  The conditions and what we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And prior to my -- that comes later. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I just wanted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">My parents agreed to send me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , to relatives for a year or two, where I could study, learn the language, and come back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">QUESTION:  And how old were you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="395">ANSWER:  16. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">But while I was here I met my husband whose family had -- my husband's name is Werner, W-E-R-N-E-R. His family fled from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">They were smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">But they had relatives here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">My husband's father had a sister in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , so they obtained affidavits and came in 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And my husband and I were engaged in 1952. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">That same year he was drafted into the Army and was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where he served in the military intelligence in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">QUESTION:  And I want to take you back for just a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">How did you get from Europe to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="408">QUESTION:  Is there anything in particular you remember about that journey?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="627">QUESTION:  So what was it that made you want to tell your story now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">ANSWER:  Iheard other people telling. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And I decided perhaps it would be a catharsis for me or it's a story that really -- the Holocaust shouldn't be forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And my -- the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> we belong to, we're looking for a speaker every year, Yom Ha'Shoah. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Someone comes to speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So I decided, Well, I'll write my story down as best as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And that's how this came about. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And it's still -- I don't know -- it's still some of these things still come back to me when I read them and I get all upset, unfortunately.</span></p>
