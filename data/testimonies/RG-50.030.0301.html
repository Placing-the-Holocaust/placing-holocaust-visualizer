ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  And your name was Per Anger then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Per Anger, I got other names, which I had never mentioned, because that was my mother wanted that I should have named after our old relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">So my name is Per Johann Valentine (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I never mentioned those other names because I don't think they are very pretty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Do you ever use them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Mr. Anger, in 1941, you were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">You were a member of the foreign service at this point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Can you tell us what that was like? </span><span class="sentence" id="12">You were a very young man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  This was my first post. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I had applied -- see, I had applied for the foreign service already earlier, but I wasn't ready with my exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uppsala</span> , I studied law, and in the meantime I was drafted; I was in the military service. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So I had difficulty in finishing this, but I just finished in time in December 1939, when the war broke out between <span class="COUNTRY">Finland</span> and the Soviets at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">A dramatic period. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And the war had already started. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">And the beginning of World War II had already started, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So the Swedish Foreign Office knowing that I was applying for entering the service, they said, "Look, here. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We have -- we need staff now. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">So we could present you as a trainee to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in January." </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And so I just got out of the military service, and I just happened to finish my law exam. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So I was sent in January 1940 to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to help at the commercial department in the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So I was working there the whole spring and went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> then in June, the same year, to apply and to go through the exam for the foreign service. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And I managed to get through that and returned then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> where I stayed on till summer '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And I returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> exactly the day when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded, so in June, midsummer '41. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So from there on, I stayed on another year in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , it was, of course, for me, for a Swede never having been out in war and all that, 1t was quite a new situation, all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And it wasn't so much all of the bombing and fighting, that didn't happen then because all over Europe was then slowly being dominated by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Not during the spring, but as you remember, in April they invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in a big operation when they took over all of Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So during this first half-year when I was there, it was very, very little of wars, things which reminds me of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">There were some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British airplanes</span> coming in now and then and dropped some bombs on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And so we had to go around in the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">But it was, of course, hard to get food and it was also a very severe winter that 1940 and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So it was in a way then kind of a hardship for all the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">But it was not destroyed and not -- those bombs didn't cause very much damage really. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But it was a psychological thing, which is very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">There came one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British airplane</span> in during the night, say, at midnight and forced the whole population down in the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And then Hitler was, of course, furious that the Air Force couldn't stop these people coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And so everybody was sitting there in the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And then after an hour, they went up again to continue to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And then after two more hours, another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> came from <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and started to drop some bombs and forced the whole population again down in the <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">So that was a kind of psychological warfare, in a way, which was very frustrating for the people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Then they started to know that now something is coming here, and this is only the beginning, which was the fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But then, you see, slowly the Germans took over, and I was there -- I was there in April when we sent the first- | think it was end of March, we sent the first dispatch or the code telegram to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> about the German planning. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">That was very -- I was there sitting in my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> on a Sunday when they telephoned from the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="48">Now, you have to come here because you are on duty, and you have to send a code telegram to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , a cipher." </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So I came there and I remember still that was one of the more dramatic periods of my life at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I was waiting for that telegram to come, and my boss said, "Now, in a few minutes you will get the most terrible message you ever have met to send to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And that was the information we had got through the underground, and Kanaris (ph) and those people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> who were working against Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And we got through them the whole plan that in a few days, they are going to invade <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> -- we didn't know about <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , if they were going to touch <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And that's part of a bigger plan to conquer the whole of Europe, including <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , which they never succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">But the whole of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">So I got that in, and I started to put it into this mapping machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">It was at that time a very awkward machine, a modern thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And I managed to get it through and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> and mailed that to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , and then I couldn't sleep, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">My god, perhaps I had made the wrong sort of -- pushed the wrong button or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So what happens -- what could happen now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> is that the Germans will invade <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> tomorrow; and they will not be warned in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because there was a sloppy sort of attache at the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> who couldn't cipher, who couldn't send the right telegram to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">That will be you can read it in all the history books about this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">It was a nightmare I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And, of course, they could, and that is the interesting reaction then in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> -- “We think you have been nervous tn <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I mean, we can't understand why you sort of exaggerate things like that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And they didn't believe us. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And then, not till a couple of days before, I would say five days before the invasion, we send a new cable. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And then they understood that now, it's serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Now, it's serious, but that was rather later. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">You know, we were not prepared at all to defend our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And Hitler apparently thought that it wasn't necessary to invade <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because he could always do that later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="70"><span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> was always there, and we were delivering iron ore to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And he was happy with that, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So granted, they conquered <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , and the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So I was then in that situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Then, we were in administration, we were sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> and didn't know from one day or the other if the Germans were going to include <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> also in the attack towards <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And then I also remember another episode which I very much remember is when the brigade or the army, whatever you call it, returned from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> marching through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and how the people greeted them and throwing flowers towards the soldiers and thinking that now, the war is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And the war had just started, you know, which they couldn't understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">The war had just started. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And they marched, these troops marched up and lined up outside the big <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">The Villa Platt (ph) was the name, and out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> came Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And he was greeted then by the masses saying "Heil, Hitler" and all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I was standing there and everybody did this, that salute, so I thought I better do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Otherwise, I don't -- but I had forgotten one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I had still my hat on, and then a man right behind me gave me a blow like that so my hat flew away, I don't how long, because you shouldn't stand facing the Fuhrer with a hat on. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So that was that atmosphere, you know, of sort of he had more or less hypnotized the whole population. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">He was the -- I mean, the savior, the Fuhrer and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">So that gave me the first impression; I saw how terribly this system had infiltrated in the whole population. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And then after that came also the persecutions of the -- the Jewish persecutions and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">One didn't notice so much of it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> because they did it in a very clever, secret way. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">But I remember that I had a housekeeper, a Jewish lady, who came to -- I was a bachelor at the time -- to clean up my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">All of a sudden, or one day, she didn't come. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">She just disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So they disappeared, just like that, and were brought to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camps</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Only at that time, it wasn't very much known in the world, I would say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Were you getting reports about what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and then what was happening <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in terms of the persecution . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Ya.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION: ... not just the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Yes, we didn't very much, say, in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We didn't know very about it then -- or '41, I didn't know other than there was discriminations against the Jewish people and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But the first real report we sent -- I wasn't there then, I was then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> -- was sent in '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">You see, there was the big conference in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wannsee</span> in the beginning of '42, when the final solution was decided upon. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And then towards the end of that year, the world started to know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I know that the Americans knew about it; also, the Swedish. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">The American government knew about it, the Swedish government and all that; because we had a diplomat at the <span class="BUILDING">Berlin Embassy</span> , a good friend of mine, who on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in, say, October '42 met an SS officer who came up and said, "I have to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I can't stand it any longer." </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And he told him the whole story about the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And that we reported <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> in '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So, for sure, from the autumn of '42, the Swedish government and the Americans got the same report, and the Swiss and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">From that on, most of the governments in the <span class="REGION">western world</span> knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I think that is important to say because to -- knowing how little they did, or they did nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Did you know about the euthanasia killings in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  About the what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  About the euthanasia, when they were doing so-called mercy killings in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , in the mental hospitals?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  I didn't know at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I think we got to know about that later. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I didn't know anything then at that time, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  When you said you were in this situation watching the Fuhrer and watching everybody respond to him and you almost raised your hand in a "Heil, Hitler," but, fortunately, you were stopped, what were you thinking? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Were you frightened and thought you would have to do it because somebody . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Why, they would have killed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Oh absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">There saying such -- what do I say -- excited, what you call, hypnotical (sic) situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They were spellbound. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They were spellbound by this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So if you said anything against him or if you did anything to him, you would have been killed on the spot by the mass of people, by the crowd.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  When you met ordinary Germans during this period, did they -- were they hypnotized even outside of that situation when there were crowds?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Well, they -- not hypnotized, but they were all indoctrinated in a fantastic way. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I mean, this Goebbels must have been absolute, remarkable professional in the way of spreading this information or indoctrinating people. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Imagine, at that time there was no television. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">There was just the spoken word. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">There was the radio, of course, and the newspapers, but that was enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I was living at that time at the pension, where I was sitting around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with the Germans and old people and how the day after the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> were so happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">They said, "Look, aren't you happy?" </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Looked at me, "Why?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="133">Because we have saved, we have saved your neighbors from being invaded by the allies, by the British. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And now, they are going to be free people, and, of course, under our control. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Anyhow, we have saved them from this imperialist sort of western powers." </span><span class="sentence" id="136">This whole attitude was so all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">There were no exceptions from that theory. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And, of course, it was part of it and so forth that they were also perhaps -- even if they thought that it was absolutely the wrong, the right version of it, they were scared to say something against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Because then they knew what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So everybody was -- I mean, even the officials in the foreign service with whom I had to deal, they were all the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">They never doubted. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">When you came up to the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> , I was dealing with the commercial things, always the same salute. "</span><span class="sentence" id="143">Heil, Hitler," like that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I never said, "Heil, Hitler." </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Never in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So that was the way of greeting people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">QUESTION:  What sort of an impression -- you were a very young person and certainly had not experienced this kind of form of government, this kind of oppression. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">What effect did this have on you in your mid 20s, late 20s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Well, that's -- of course, it was very strange for me to encounter such a system. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Of course, it was, but that is also very dangerous because without knowing if yourself, you get indoctrinated. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">If you every day hear the same thing in radio, read the same thing in the paper, hearing people speaking about the same thing, about how victorious we are and how we are going to conquer the whole world, and all that and so on, and Hitler is a fantastic man. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">He has given us jobs and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So I sometimes had the impression that I have to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> now for some vacation to breathe, to listen to other opinions than this. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I mean, this 1s remarkable how you can get influenced without knowing it yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  Did you see any persecution of anybody? </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Beatings in the <span class="DLF">street</span> or...
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  Nothing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  No, I didn't see anything like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  How did it happen that you were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> in 1942?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Well, it so happened because I was then off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> dealing with the Hungarian affairs in the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> with the commercial matters, and there were delegations from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And we were negotiating with them, and we saw that <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> is a potential sort of delivery of our goods we need. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Foodstuffs, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="163"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was and still is an agricultural country, you know, so then they wanted to send someone who already got some experience in these negotiations. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> mainly because they needed someone for this job. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So I was participating in the negotiations there. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The Swedish delegation coming out, I was a member of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And we tried to -- you know, that old system of negotiations about trade that if we give you some steel, you give us some apples.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Bartering?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Bargaining like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Bilateral sort of trade which doesn't exist any longer happily enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So that was my job from 1942 when I came in November '42 to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> onwards till, say, till '43, '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Beginning of '44 and so on when it wasn't very much -- you didn't notice very much of the war then in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> at that time even if <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was an ally to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">But the Hungarians, first of all, they didn't like -- of course, nobody likes war, but they were forced into this war. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And it was also perhaps rather easy for the Germans to force them to get into the war on their side because this all goes back to the first world war, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">The injustice of the first world war, which I think after the second world war, people had -- the western powers and learned much more how to treat those who have defeated. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">That after the first world war, they decided to more or less exterminate <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , or they -- <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they put on the shoulders of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> those enormous debts in all the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And they on the map sort of drew up new <span class="DLF">lines</span> , <span class="DLF">lines</span> for new <span class="COUNTRY">states</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And they cut off then artificial <span class="DLF">borders</span> , but they didn't think of that now, we are placing a great minority of people on the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , within the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> ’ <span class="DLF">borders</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , they took away from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> two-thirds of their <span class="REGION">territory</span> after the first world war and gave it to the neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So that was still -- that was always in the mind of the Hungarians, this feeling of revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">We have to get back our <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And, of course, when they joined <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the second world war, that was their hope and that goes back, everything, which doesn't prevent history to take it away again after the second world war. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So that's how it went, you know, with those <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So that was very sad that people who didn't understand the history of Europe and all that, the statesmen at that time, I think they caused very much all the reasons for everything for the second world war. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">All the fault which was made during after the first world war, more or less, caused the second world war, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  What was your daily life like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> during those two years before the occupation by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in '42 and '43?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  Well, it was, as I told you, 1t was going on as usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">The Hungarians had, of course, participated in the war already, but they lost their whole army in the battle on the <span class="REGION">east front</span> at the beginning of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And after that, they said to themselves, "Never, we are not going to be active any longer in this war." </span><span class="sentence" id="190">So when the Germans -- and then during this period and when I was there, '42 till '44, when <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded, the life went on more or less as usual. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We had our trade negotiations with them, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> looked rather peaceful. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">There had been no bombing to speak of from the Russians or from any of the enemies. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And the Hungarians are people who enjoy life, and I was sitting at the <span class="BUILDING">cafes</span> there and listening to the Gypsy music and so on and so on as it always had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , this beautiful <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And then this situation, of course, completely changed in March '44 when the Germans decided to invade <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> because of two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">The first was that they wanted to force the Hungarians to fight now more actively on these fronts against the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And, secondly, that they have to start off also with the final solution, which they hadn't done. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">There was, of course, anti-Semitic feelings in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , as there had always been. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And also part of the explanation that is also part of what happened after the first world war when -- you see, 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to do business wasn't -- a gentleman couldn't do business. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">That was the Jewish people who had the business in their hand, they thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">They were sitting on their <span class="DLF">estates</span> , you know, and had their <span class="BUILDING">castles</span> and the upper class and all that is one. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And they left all the business in the hands of the Jewish people, and also many Jewish people were then in those professions as doctors, as architects, and all those professions. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So when <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> then lost two-thirds of that <span class="REGION">territory</span> , all the -- or most of the Hungarians were sitting out on this <span class="REGION">land</span> which was taken over by neighboring <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">They moved into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to that center, and then they found that all professions more or less were taken by the Jewish people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And so that, of course, increased the anti-Semitics in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But they never came to that extreme that they tried to exterminate the whole race in terms of to find a solution like the Germans had. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So that led, of course, to the situation that the people, the Jewish people in other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in Europe like in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , if they could, they fled to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> because they said, "Well, look, there is a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which is still is free." </span><span class="sentence" id="207">It was in the paper it was independent even if it was allied to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but they knew, everybody knew that they hadn't come to any persecutions in that big scale as all that had been done in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So the population in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> increased to 800,000 people, living 600,000 in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> and about 200,000 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  The Jews, you're talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  Huh?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  Jews, Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And so that was one of the purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">The second purpose was then for the Germans to invade <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to force them now to bring the final solution to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">That was the purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">QUESTION:  Had Jewish people's lives changed very much during the period of the alliance with the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  Pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  Did the life of the Jews change very much during the period of time prior to the occupation? </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Were there laws like the Nuremberg Laws for the lost professions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  They had some Jews -- discriminated the Jewish people, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">They had, for instance, there were quotas for so-and-so many could only study at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So there had already been -- those laws had already been introduced after the first world war and slowly increased and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">But they were not sort of serious really compared to what happened then in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but it was discrimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Certainly, it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  Were there other groups who were discriminated against during this period of time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  Well, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Really, it wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">The Gypsies, for instance, which the Germans also sent to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">But in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> they were treated like -- they were favored because they liked them. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">They played in the <span class="BUILDING">cafes</span> and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">No, there was mainly the Jewish people who were discriminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And all -- see, they didn't have these problems either with the minorities because all the people now within their <span class="DLF">borders</span> were Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Contrary to today when big minorities are living in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Germania</span> and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">QUESTION:  Were there discussions in the legation or between legations about the potential for more severe persecution in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and some attempt to make preparations for that prior to the occupation in March?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">ANSWER:  No, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">It didn't happen very much before the Germans came in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">QUESTION:  So there wasn't a sense that the Germans will probably come in, and if they do, the situation will get worse?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">ANSWER:  Well, what we discovered was, of course, was that there were some people in the government or in the departments, some high-ranking officials who were very anti-Jewish, anti-Semitic and so on, which then they came into power then when the situation had changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So we knew there was a growing feeling among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">That, we knew; but they had no say because it was, after all, Horthy was a strange man anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">He was the Head of State, of course, and he like all these magnates, all these upper class, they never sort of for persecution, but they didn't -- they were sort of anti-Jewish in a way that they didn't accept them really in society, if I may take that as an example and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It didn't prevent , for instance, to have a few Jewish good friends with whom he played bridge and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I mean, it was kind of a mixture of anti-Semitics and after all, having good friends also among the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">It's a lot difficult to give you the exact definition of how strong these feelings against the Jewish people were at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">But then, of course, when all the Nazi people in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , when they came into power, or the pro-Germans came into power, but even so, the first government which came into power was kind of a --- Sztojay was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">He was Ambassador to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and he was known as being very much pro-German, but they made a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And I think all of them kind of made a difference between people who were pro- German and people who were Nazis in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="249">For instance, the old Swedish generation, you know, military people and bureaucrats, they admired very much the old <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for their efficiency and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">But when they were faced with this new situation with the Nazis, of course, they were all against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">So I mean, I think this Ambassador to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , Sztojay, was a typical pro-German Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And he came into power, and it's typical then how we managed to negotiate with him, with that government and how they approved those passports and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">They did. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I mean, they would never have done that if they had been extreme Nazi people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  Just to go back for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">You were married in 1943 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">We were married in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , but we made our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> shortly after in June 1943.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">QUESTION:  Can you explain a little bit your position? </span><span class="sentence" id="261">You were a second secretary in negotiation when you first came in '42?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  The attaché is perhaps the name or secretary or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">It's the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Today, we don't have attachés; we have secretaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">But we always called attachés because that was the first position we had abroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And I was in charge of, as I told you, about the trade business and commerce and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">But, you see, an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> , a very small <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> like that, it was only the ambassador or you call it minister at that time because it was delegation -- we cannot forget about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Say, the ambassador, myself that is next in command. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">We had a <span class="BUILDING">chancellor office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">We had the two girls who were typewriting, and we had a coach attaché and a driver. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">That was all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  Seven people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  Ya, that was the whole staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Then, what did we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Well, we had to safeguard the Swedish interests, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">If there were Swedish citizens there, we have to protect them, and all the legal business for the Swedes, you know, and the trade and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Information about <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , the culture relations. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">We had so many cultural interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">It was rather strange when I think of it that in the midst of the war we had so much of exchange on the <span class="REGION">cultural side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We have Swedish opera singers who came. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Jussi Bjorling, for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">He came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , was singing there in the opera. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">In 1942, '43, those two years, we had nearly every month we had someone coming from the Swedish Opera and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We had the Swedish language taught at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So the commercial and the cultural business and the political -- wasn't very much, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We didn't have any exchange in that <span class="DLF">field</span> very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Of course, we listened to what they said because they were, after all, allied to Germans, so we reported <span class="BUILDING">home</span> about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Some political dispatches and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">That was all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  Were you getting continuous dispatches about the war and about what was happening...
ANSWER:  Pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">QUESTION:  Were you getting dispatches about the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  Ya, well, ...
QUESTION:  What about the...
ANSWER:  We reported what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">We reported about the defeat on the <span class="REGION">east front</span> , the German army or the Hungarian army and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">About the feelings about the first bombings when the Russians dropped a few bombs on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> once, and the atmosphere and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">We were reporting about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">QUESTION:  Now, I also mean were you getting reports? </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> giving you reports about what was happening <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">ANSWER:  Oh, always, always. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">We always relayed reports like that between the <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> , you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So we were aware of what was happening, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">QUESTION:  So explain what March 19th, 1944 was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Where were you when the Germans came 1n?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  Well, that's how I start my book. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">When I was awake in the morning on a Sunday morning when the ambassador telephoned me and said, "You have to come to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> now because the Germans are on the way to invade the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="305">And so I saw the German troops coming in with big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and artillery and everything through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and how people were scared and how people felt that now their independence is at stake now and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And above all, the Jewish people understood what was going to happen there. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">That's for sure, and the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And to only a few days after to see every third people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> wearing a yellow star and all that made me sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I mean, how could one discriminate another race? </span><span class="sentence" id="310">How could one doom -- I mean, the doomsday for Jewish people has come. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">How on earth is that possible to do all this? </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Even if I had known a little bit about it in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to see it now in full development, see, that was terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">QUESTION:  How quickly did people have to put on a Jewish star?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">ANSWER:  Oh, that came like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Rules were sort of issued immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And if you didn't wear it, you were punished. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And they had already, you see, they had already information, the Germans about the -- now, this was about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I don't know about the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> so much, but they had already information about the most prominent Jewish people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">So without we couldn't do anything because just the first days, they just arrested, say, a couple of hundred Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Many of them are best, good friends, really, and the only -- this is really strange -- the only family who managed to get out was the Manfred-Vice (ph) family. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">This was a big industrialist. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">They had the big <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> on Saffle (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Saffle (ph) was an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and they managed to negotiate and they were very clever. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And one of them, one of the family -- the whole family was, with relatives, about 120 people or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">But one of them was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and tortured and all that, but he managed to say, "I want to negotiate." </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And he knew there were two that were -- there were Himmler on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and Goering on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , who both wanted to have these <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">So he made a deal with one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">I think it was Himmler, I think, who got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Because Himmler knew that if he didn't play his cards, it would be taken all by the Goering family. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">So he managed to get free sort of traveling for the whole family to <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , plus an amount of money and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So those people were given false Portuguese passports and were all sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">That's the only example I know of how at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">At the very beginning, people managed to get out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  What happened at the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Were people immediately crowding around the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">ANSWER:  Oh, ya. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">The following days they were queuing up outside the <span class="BUILDING">neutral embassies</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">The neutral <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> at that time was the Swedish, the Swiss, the Portuguese and the Spanish, and also the <span class="BUILDING">Vatican</span> had their representation there. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">They were queuing up outside our <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> in big numbers, and it was very, very difficult to know what to do really. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And as I have written in my book and all that, we tried to improvise and we tried to find ways of bluffing the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And we gave those people who had very close connections with <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , married to Swedish lady perhaps, or having their relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , or very, very close trade relations with <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , we gave them Swedish provisional passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">A Swedish provisional passport is a document which you, as a rule, can give to Swedish citizen or someone who says, "I am Swedish, but I have lost my passport." </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And, "Oh, here, you can have a provisional one. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and verify your identity there, and you will get an ordinary passport." </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Really, a traveler's document, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And so I took on me to give away a few of these without instructions from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I took the risk to be fired, but anyhow .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="348">QUESTION:  Can you tell us about the first time you did it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">ANSWER:  Well, it was one of the days just after the invasion when I was sitting at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and then came one of my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">He was Jewish head of one of the big Swedish companies in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">He was coming and he was hiding his star with a portfolio like this (indicating). </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And he said to me "Per Anger, you have to help me." </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I said, "Is this a new situation?" </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I said, "We have instructions to help Swedish citizens, and we have no instructions to help any other nationals. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">That's against every international law and all that." </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So I don't know what to do, but after I thought of it for a while, I said, "I give you a provisional passport." </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And then not only to him, but to his wife, to his daughter, and to all the grandchildren. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So the whole family got provisional passports, and I said -- I was waiting for some reprimands from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , but they, fair enough, they approved afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  Did you write a report to them to say what you had done?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER:  Oh, ya. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Certainly, I do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I describe the situation and all that, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And then we worked in that sort of direction, more or less. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">We gave them -- we couldn't keep provisional passports too many, but we invented these certificates. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">We established sort of certificates saying that the holder of this certificate has just applied for Swedish citizenship, and until he gets that he is under the protection of the Swedish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">The document had stamps and everything on it, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And also, we got authorization from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> to give visa to people who could show that they had relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and all that and so on, and to them we gave this. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Also, identity papers saying that the holder of this paper has got visa to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Until he is able to travel to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , he's under the protection of the Swedish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I mean, a completely legal document according to international law, but the Nazis, you know, there were many of those Nazis who were illiterate, and they were very impressed by papers with stamps and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">So we got many examples of how those people -- many of those people were saved from being deported through showing these papers, so even to own them. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">We issued around 600, 700 of those papers and these people were saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">But, you see, the numbers of those people increased the whole time, and we couldn't cope with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We were only, as I told you, a handful of people in the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So that comes to the new situation; then we ask for more staff from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="376">QUESTION:  At this time, were other groups, were other legations, the neutrals, also writing out provisional passports like this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  Well, there was, of course, the Swiss already had the British interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">You see, in all the wars, the first world war, the second world war, both the neutral countries like <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> have taken upon them to protect the enemies' interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">In other words, you can't keep your <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> in the enemy's <span class="BUILDING">capitol</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">So, for instance, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , the Swiss had the American and the British interests and to hold their <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> and citizens and protected them, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And we had other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Finland</span> , we even had the Soviet Union's interests in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">So they were under our protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Now, <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> had the British interests and the British had this old system with Palestine certificates which the Swiss took over, enabling people to immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> -- to immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Afterward, <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And that was, of course, very restrictive because the British were not very anxious to increase that quota because their interests, their relationship with the Arabs and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And so that's a long story and so on, but didn't prevent the Swiss from going on and issuing those papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So I think that was the start for the Swiss, was the Palestine certificates, and if they then changed that into the same protective passport as we had -- I don't remember, but I think they did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Finally, they copied us, like the others, like the Spanish people and the Portuguese and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">So I think they more or less followed in our footsteps.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="390">QUESTION:  From the beginning, from March.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="391">ANSWER:  Well, thatis when the —_.. That's later on then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">QUESTION:  Later on’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  At the very beginning, I don't think that they did very much because I don't think -- they couldn't do very much trying the same way perhaps as we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I can't tell you how they succeeded because we were so occupied with our own problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So we had -- from that time, I don't remember very much of what they did, just the first days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="396">QUESTION:  Were you -- do you know whether the legation or you yourself was contacted by the Zionist underground during this period prior to the deportations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER:  By the Hungarian underground?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="398">QUESTION:  By the Zionist underground, the Zionist group?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">ANSWER:  Ya, so -- well, no, we were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">We were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">We had some connections later on with them and ____ had, but not at that time, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">It became more and more important later on towards the end of the war, you know, when we were all in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , you see, where we were all living underground after having been liquidated by the Nazis.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="403">QUESTION:  Did you or any of your staff witness the ghettoization in April of 1944? </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Did you go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="405">ANSWER:  In '44?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">ANSWER:  Ya, certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva Ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  Oh, ya, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  Did you visit that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  Well, I went, I was there, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Not very often, but we had our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">We had our own <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> with the people with the passports and all that under our protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">QUESTION:  No, I meant in April, prior to all the deportations and the <span class="BUILDING">safe houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liebau Ghetto</span> was established in April. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Did you...
ANSWER:  Was it established that early? </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Well, no, I didn't see it then. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I saw it later on, later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  So the situation changes again radically between May and July when these huge deportations begin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  No, well, you see, the situation was this: That when you come to July, then the whole <span class="REGION">countryside</span> was evacuated and the 600,000 people were already sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">200,000 people were still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and then except for this Manfred-Vice (ph) family and a few others, what managed to escape, there were 200 people -- 200,000 Jewish people still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So our concentration then when Wallenberg comes was to try to save those who were there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about a little bit prior to Wallenberg coming, a Mr. Langley (ph) who was in the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> and connected with the Swedish Red Cross, what was he trying to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="426">ANSWER:  Well, he was the -- like I said from the beginning, the cultural attaché because he was teaching Swedish at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So we appointed him cultural attaché at the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> , and he was a very good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Had a fantastic feeling for his fellowman and a great idealist and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">He - | would say that he was the man who pushed us very much to do something, because he knew, he knew much more than we did about the Hungarian situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">He had lived there for all the years, so he had a feeling more than we what was coming on. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">So he insisted very much from the very beginning that, of course, this 1s good what we are doing here, but we need more staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">We need more help. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And why don't we ask Count Bernadotte (ph) to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> with a Red Cross delegation to try to do something? </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Now, that failed because Bernadotte (ph) never got visa to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">The Germans refused to have a relative of the Swedish monarchy on the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">They couldn't see that, so that never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">But we raised the question in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> that we need more staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And that's how -- and not only for that purpose, but also for safeguarding the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> ’ interests, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- well, I don't know did you say tell this chronological order or not, but Wallenberg comes first. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And then I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in August with my wife and our baby, left them <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to get staff, more staff for taking care of these other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> ' interests, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So this little <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> of five people grew to quite an enormous organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">We had the ambassador who was very loyal to this action and very -- I mean, for us it was a great thing, and for Wallenberg also, of course, that he was staying on. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">It gave our <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> a prestige which the others didn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">The Swiss Ambassador, when it started to -- the bombs started to fall, he went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">The Portuguese left; the Spanish Ambassador left; all of them left. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">So the only one remaining was -- of course, the Vatican representative, he was there and our ambassador. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So we could always -- we always had this base of a strong <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> with an ambassador and all that, which guaranteed legality of our existence and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So that was how our situation was. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">And then I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to get all these people for the special section for the foreign interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">So we had the original <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> , where I was sitting in the middle as a coordinator, more or less, to start with, to coordinate the enormous department __ established. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">The Red Cross, which Langley was basing, was leading, we had the Save the Children, a lady called Asta Nielsen (ph), she was also in the Red Cross in a way or Save the Children Fund. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">That was the three, we had this big department for the foreign interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">We had one special section for buying all the foodstuffs and all that on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> for the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> where we had all the people hiding and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So this became really quite a big organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="455">QUESTION:  Tell me one thing about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Langley</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Did this happen prior to the arrival of Raoul Wallenberg? </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Did he put signs on <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that said, "Under the protection of the Swedish Red Cross"?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  Uh-huh, ya. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">He was very well-meaning. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">He tried to help, and the problem with him was, of course, that he wasn't that well organized, so as soon one come and asked for help, he said, "Oh, here, you have a passport or Red Cross," and so on, and he took under his protection <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> and <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and all that and put on the sign "This is under protection of the Swedish Red Cross." </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And, you see, this became kind of inflation of those papers, and so it became difficult for him in the long run to defend all these. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">So this was a headache for us very often to rush out when the Nazis invaded one of his <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , for us to rush out and try to stop these Nazis from doing something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But he helped many, and he saved many people, so he should have all the credit for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">But the problem was, as I say, that he never knew where to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I mean, there was also discussions I had with Raoul Wallenberg later on, "We can't give protective passports to the whole Budapest population because then they will have no value. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So we have to hide ourselves behind a bureaucracy." </span><span class="sentence" id="467">But we were able to show, the Germans could come in and look at our files and see those people had protective passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Because this man has a cousin in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">This person is married to a Swedish girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">This man is head of big Swedish -- so those criteria were very important to keep and to have as a kind of a protection against accusations that were going around. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So it was a well organized bureaucracy which helped us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  Let's stop now, so we can change the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">It was a perfect ending. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">End of Tape 1. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Tape 2
QUESTION:  If you can, keep the chronology.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  Keep the chronology?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  I'll try.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">I'll try, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">ANSWER:  If it's possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">QUESTION:  Mr. Anger, Raoul Wallenberg arrives July 9th, 1944, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="484">You knew that he was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">You had been asked about him. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">What did you think about the presence of Raoul Wallenberg coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">ANSWER:  Well, first they asked us. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We are intending -- the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> cabled us, we are intending to send Raoul Wallenberg to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> in this one Italian mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">We didn't know the background then about the negotiations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> between the <span class="BUILDING">American Embassy</span> and the Jewish -- well, congress on one hand and this <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> on the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">But we only got the message "We are intending to send Raoul Wallenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">We want your comments." </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And I said to the ambassador, "Of course, this couldn't be better because I know him, and I know he's the right man." </span><span class="sentence" id="493">So, of course, they would never have sent him if we had said, "No, for heaven's sake, don't send Wallenberg." </span><span class="sentence" id="494">But that was never the question, so he came as you said on the 9th of July to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Late, of course, too late, but that was not his fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Nobody's fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Of course, the whole <span class="REGION">countryside</span> was already evacuated and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">So once he was appointed, he traveled day and night to come as soon as possible to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">QUESTION:  What happened when he first arrived? </span><span class="sentence" id="500">What was your first discussion about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">ANSWER:  Well, he came there to the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> where we were in full work trying to issue those papers I told you about. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">The whole <span class="DLF">garden</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> was full of people who were lining up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Who knows who they were, and trying to issue those different certificates and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And there he comes, and as I describe it in my book, he comes then with equipment rather odd for a diplomat. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">He's carrying sleeping bag and a knapsack and the revolver, and he was very proud to show me this revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And, of course, I knew that everyone in the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> had a revolver somewhere lying. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">But the man coming was like this (indicating) and he joked. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">He had a good sense of humor, also, Raoul Wallenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">So you see, this only -- it gives me more courage to have this in my pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">He never used it, of course, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">But he had it with him and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleeping bag</span> and all this equipment was very -- this came to use, of course, later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Which he had this kind of a mission, of course, that he had been in the military service in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> like I, and we had met there, so he knew what it was to sleep under a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">So he was perhaps thinking of a situation where we were going to be bombed out and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">So he had this sort of equipment with him, and then he saw all this activity around. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">He said, "What are you doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I briefed him; I gave sort of a description of what we are doing, and he saw the documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And that is typical for him with his inventiveness that he more or less on the spot said, "Well, it's very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">But I think of an idea -- I have idea one could perhaps make them more spectacular, these certificates." </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Same reading as I had once upon a time invented myself, but now a document with a Swedish emblem, the Swedish coat of arms on it in blue and yellow colors and the ambassador's signature and stamps and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">It made it more like an official document, an authentic Swedish passport in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">So that was his first -- the first action was to invent this. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And then another quality he had was that he was very good negotiator. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I knew that because he had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> before 1942, '43 negotiating for his firm in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> about trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And I followed him there to see how he negotiated about this quota of foodstuffs coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">So I discovered there that he was a good negotiator. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">That also came to use because he then started to negotiate with them, the new government, about these passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And he got the approval of, say, 4,500 passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And also the approval to have these people living in <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> under our protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">That was his first action, to say, and...
QUESTION:  Was that his idea, also, the safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">ANSWER:  That was his idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">That was his idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Oh, yes, it was because, you see, there were so many empty <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> because Jewish people had been living in their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And then the first step was, of course, to put on the yellow star on your clothes, and the second, that you could be identified. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And then you had to go together in <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> with the yellow star on it, and they had to leave their <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , you see, and being concentrated in special <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And the next step after that was, of course, to be brought to the general <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and from there on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">That was the sort of procedure in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">But it's interesting then that prior to his arrival, I was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> one day when the cablegram came from the King of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , the old king, Gustavus V, that he appeals to halt, to stop all these deportations. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So I delivered that, and I remembered that my ambassador was on leave and I telephoned him, and he said, "Oh, I'll come with you, then." </span><span class="sentence" id="540">So we dressed up in morning coats, you know, that you have when you meet Head of State, as is rather peculiar situation in the middle of the war, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">This long tails and all that and high top hats, and went to Horthy and presented the message from the king. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And Horthy looked at it and he said, "Oh, this is terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I can't believe that my compatriots are committing themselves those crimes, and I'm so unhappy about all this and that." </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And he sent a message back to the king in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , saying that he was going to do his best. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And he actually stopped deportations from -- it was too late for the __—s—s,_ but he stopped deportations from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">They had just came to the surroundings. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Several areas of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> had already been evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I was myself there and saw it, but when it came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> itself, 1t stopped because of all this intervention. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So it's this peculiar situation when Raoul Wallenberg had then started off all this action to have people under our protection with passports living in these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and all that, everything was organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And he said, "Well, I've done my job, and no more deportations will take place. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">So I better prepare my trip back to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="552">This was in August, the end of August, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">The beginning of September, perhaps, when the new situation later on comes when after the revolution when the , the Hungarian Nazis take over. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Then, comes the real job, and it's -- you think in terms of nine months when Raoul Wallenberg was there, from July to January, and of those nine months, he used the first month just to organize things. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">But the real rescue operations where he also went out to the <span class="BUILDING">railway stations</span> and all that -- I was very often with him and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">It was a concentrated work of three months where he saves all those people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">QUESTION:  Let's talk about this period between July and October just a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">When he came, did he have a formal mission that he announced to you, or was it very clear what he was supposed to do from some papers that you had received before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">ANSWER:  Well, he had a clear mandate from the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">He had negotiated or had already started negotiating in a clever way with the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> , and got a mandate to operate quite independently, but under, of course, the cover of the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> and subordinated, of course, to the ambassador. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And in the case of the ambassadors delegating me under my sort of command in a way, but we were sort of equal and good friends so that was no problem at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">So the edict was quite clear that he could perform as he thought would be the most useful, most -- the best one to save as many people as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">That he used then unconventional methods and all that, that was hard -- I mean, you see, it was in a way very typical situation was this: That I was sitting there at the Oder (ph) Swedish Embassy and everybody was sort of respecting an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I was a diplomat; my boss was a diplomat, all that dramatic status. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Raoul Wallenberg was a businessman, but he was also given diplomatic status, no doubt about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So he had the same -- from the international law, from that viewpoint, he had the same status and the same protection as we had, but being more or less a freelance or having his own department and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">We closed our eyes very often when he did things which a diplomat never does. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Bribe people, like that, you know, to save people's lives or doing things out of the ordinary and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And we thought that was a good way of organizing the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">That he goes "Oh, look, here. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">With the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> we are not doing that," and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And we don't know about anything illegal and so on and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">There you come to a question, which I don't know if you would like me to talk about now. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And that is the relationship between <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="575">How on earth, why did they accept this, the Germans? </span><span class="sentence" id="576">That's a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Shall we talk about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="578">That is, of course, there you have a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , in this case, completely under the command of the Germans, but having a puppet government. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">The German and Hungarian government who is in charge whom they could handle as they -- I mean, they could decide anything, the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">They could fire the government; they could do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">But they let this government act because for the image of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> it was in a way good to show that we are -- haven't occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> to enslave them, to have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">They are a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and they have their old government, and they have all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">That is their relationship between the Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">Now, but how could they accept then that the Hungarians went on and made agreements with <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> about the Jewish people who they liked to extinguish, to exterminate? </span><span class="sentence" id="585">And then comes this situation into the picture that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was very anxious, especially towards the end of the war, to have a breathing hole up in the north. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Have a neutral <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> there with whom they could negotiate. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">They could have their spies there, of course, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">That was -- all the people, both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , were happy to have <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because they could meet and they could -- sort of a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which was not involved in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And some authors, and I'm not quite sure that I share all this opinion entirely and so on, but the fact is that towards the end of the war the Germans tried, even first the underground in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> tried, those people who were fighting against Hitler tried through our people in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> through the Wallenbergs -- that's the relatives of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span> -- to get contact with the allies. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Not with the Soviets, but with the others, with the British and the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Tried to get contact with them through us to say this: That why couldn't we try to make a deal here now, and we will try to do something? </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And they tried to kill Hitler, but they didn't manage. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And on the condition that we capitulate the Jew and that we could make a separate agreement with Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And we all -- and then Himmler worked on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">It's funny, but he also worked on that idea later on when he said to Bernadotte, I think, that we must all now stand up against this Communistic danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">They are going to invade Europe, and, you know, we all have to fight against the Communist. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And why don't we now -- why don't you help us to make an agreement with the allies that we could stop the war with them and we all join force against the Soviet? </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Completely unrealistic idea, of course, because there was 100 percent solidarity between the Americans and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and the Soviets on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> to win the war against the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">That was how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">In other words, I think that this time then in 1944 when the war was coming closer to an end that they thought perhaps that it's good to have <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">You never know, perhaps we could have their help, I don't know, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And by all means one shouldn't violate the diplomat relations between <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they respected us as diplomats the whole time. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Even Eichmann respected, in a way, Wallenberg even if he hated him. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And they tried once to kill him in letting one of the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> drive into Raoul Wallenberg's <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , but Raoul Wallenberg wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And we reported that to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> instructed our <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to protest in the <span class="BUILDING">German Foreign Office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And they did, and the German Foreign Office got upset and they reprimanded Eichmann and said, "Why on earth do you do things like that? </span><span class="sentence" id="607">We have to respect the Swedes, the Swedish immunity, the diplomats and all that." </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And then comes this rather funny answer from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">You can find that now in the files which are all open now. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Then he answered back, he said, "Well, I'm sorry, but I couldn't help doing this, trying to do this because Raoul Wallenberg used such unconventional methods." </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So that explains, partly explains why they accepted Raoul Wallenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And they said after all a handful of Jewish people, if they can be saved just for our image towards <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , it's only good they -- perhaps that was what they thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And there on one side of this, why, how did Wallenberg manage? </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And even I, when I spoke to German officers at the <span class="BUILDING">railway stations</span> , opened these <span class="DLF">doors</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">We have Swedish people there and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">It's just because of this reason that they wanted to be correct, to say, towards us. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And I had, of course, my connections with the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> , <span class="BUILDING">German Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> was with the ordinary diplomats. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And they helped me sometimes to get visa for some people and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">But there was only a few cases, so we had these official connections with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And it's interesting then when the whole comes to an end, when all the Germans evacuate from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , there was a telephone call from the <span class="BUILDING">German embassy</span> which says, "Could you take over our interests?" </span><span class="sentence" id="622">We had already the Soviets and the others and so on, and we got instructions from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , "By no means, no." </span><span class="sentence" id="623">But we made a compromise, so we told the Germans, "Okay, we will take over the keys to your <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">We'll have that now." </span><span class="sentence" id="625">So I went up to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> up on the side where they have the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> and met this terrible man, was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">He was not only ambassador, but he was the kind of a governor for this whole part -- a German governor for this whole of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And there he was standing very polite and gave me the keys, and that saved us in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Later on, towards the -- that's a long story -- how that saved us towards the Hungarian officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Of course, then we got a paper saying that we have now the interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">We have the interests of the <span class="BUILDING">German Embassy</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">So when they tried to arrest one of my colleagues, Berg (ph), he managed to escape, thanks to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">He was -- it's a long story, when they invaded the - when the Hungarian officers invaded the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span> on Christmas Eve 1944, tried to capture us and we managed to escape most of us, except a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">The ladies, Asta Nielsen (ph) was taken to the -- first, they were going to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">They lined them up against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> to shoot them, but they didn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Then they took them to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and there with the help of the International Red Cross we liberated them, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I wasn't at the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> at that time, so I was hiding in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">But Berg's story, Berg was the head of the Department of Foreign Interests, so when he was captured he said, "Well, I have to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> first and pack." </span><span class="sentence" id="639">They wanted to take him away, all of us they want to take away to the <span class="REGION">western Hungary</span> to where they were evacuating. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And then he said, "No, I have to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> first." </span><span class="sentence" id="641">So they gave him a Nazi man with a machine gun in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to pick up his belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Instead, he went directly up to the <span class="BUILDING">SS headquarters</span> , jumped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and said, "We have your interests here, the German interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And you have to arrest this man." </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And the Germans arrested this Hungarian Nazi and then they gave Berg a big paper saying that Mr. Berg from the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span> was taking care of the German interests. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">He's under the protection of this close Deutch Reich of the big German power. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And we duplicated that paper and I don't know how many copies. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Each of us had this copy in the pocket and we saved us many times; we showed that to the Hungarian Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">It looks like a fairy tale when you talk about it, but it was the reality at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">QUESTION:  So in a certain way, the German Nazis were respecting this very strange set of behaviors going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">ANSWER:  They were. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">What I forgot to tell you was, of course, as far as Raoul Wallenberg was concerned, it was not only the fact that he was a Swedish diplomat, but it was, of course, also his personality, I mean, which helped a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Because he was the kind of -- which I forgot to tell you -- a kind of an actor in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">He could change. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Funny, to look at him when we were together, he was sitting, speaking in a soft voice, so he looked more like an intellectual, you know, like a professor. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">But when he met the Germans, he yelled and he used the same language as they and in a very sort of ageressive way, and they were very impressed, very impressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Not only was he diplomat, but also he speaks our language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">QUESTION:  Was that shocking for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Was that a behavior that...
ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I tried to do the same thing (laughter).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="660">QUESTION:  Let me just go back to something that struck me as somewhat funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">When you first produced, printed the , you discovered something funny in the coat of arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">ANSWER:  Oh, terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">We put it in the wrong way. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">We put one crown like that and two under it; it should be the other way around, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">But nobody thought of it at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="666">QUESTION:  So the first 4,500 were all...
ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">All of them, all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">All the provisional passports had that funny emblem with the crowns put in the wrong way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">QUESTION:  And nobody noticed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">ANSWER:  No (laughter).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="671">QUESTION:  During these few months before October, before the Hungarian Nazis come in, before the comes in, are you and Wallenberg both organizing the group of people who will be doing all the work, helping? </span><span class="sentence" id="672">There's a huge organization that he creates.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">ANSWER:  Ya, ya.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">QUESTION:  Yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="675">About how many people does he bring 1n?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">ANSWER:  At the start, you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">ANSWER:  Well, the first people were those whom I had given these provisional passports or these certificates, that was the base, so to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Now, there were perhaps 20 people or whatever to start with, and then it increased because we had given them many more. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">But then -- and they organized it. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">They were very good organizers, those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">They were heads of Swedish companies. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">They had great experience in dealing with people and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">So they knew how to organize an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So he had lots of <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , though. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">One <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , say, for administrating the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="687">One <span class="BUILDING">office</span> for scrutinizing the applicants, the applications for passports and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And one <span class="NPIP">part</span> was for the provision of medicine and organizing the medical help to these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and one for providing with food stamps and all that and so on and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So towards the end of this operation, I think that he had about 400 people, Jewish volunteers who were all working.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  So it's a good bureaucracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I mean, that had to be very quickly formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Oh, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  I'm not sure that most people understand how complicated it might be to administer this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Very, very, very much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">QUESTION:  And was he the one who actually administered -- I mean, was overseeing everything or was the people that had volunteered at the top, they were doing it and he was doing very particular kind of things?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">ANSWER:  Well, he did both. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I don't know how he had time for both, but, of course, he had a kernel of people who he relied upon to start with, a handful who is his closest collaborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">You see on that picture where he sits at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and is surrounded by about six or seven people. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Those were the key people who had different <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> under their command, so to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So he delegated, of course, very much to them, but he supervised himself everything as much as he could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">QUESTION:  Is there any such thing as extraterritoriality? </span><span class="sentence" id="705">When you created these safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , is there any international law that really allows for this kind of creation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">ANSWER:  It's very -- it was a big bluff, the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I mean, how can you -- I mean, you see according to international law, there is different degrees of extraterritoriality. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">The 100 percent extraterritoriality is the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">They have the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where you are sitting and working and the <span class="BUILDING">ambassador's residence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Then comes, say, my <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> , sort of second degree, and then you have perhaps some <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> for issuing passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Another third degree, or whatever it was, but in sort of putting on a label on a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> saying that this is under our protection because, I don't know, we own it or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We created that ourselves and in all this mess, in all this confusion and with the Germans in a way tolerating it, 1t worked till the real Nazis, the Hungarians, took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Then we had great difficulty in defending our <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> and which culminated on the day when they invaded the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Because that was for us never heard of in history. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I couldn't remember anything when I studied diplomatic history once upon a time that an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> has been invaded by the government's troops in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where they were located. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">So when we were warned then, Wallenberg and myself, on Christmas -- the day before Christmas Eve that they said, "Now, you have to come with us, evacuate from here." </span><span class="sentence" id="717">And was told that the Germans remaining in the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and they said, "Well, if you don't fall out, you have to take the consequences." </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Well, we didn't think very much of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Of course, never on earth are they going to attack the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">They might attack Raoul Wallenberg's <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> , I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">But our <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> , which has 100 percent extraterritoriality, they won't, but they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">QUESTION:  Prior to October, prior to the Hungarian Nazis coming in, do you know whether Raoul Wallenberg was in touch with the underground organizations, with the Jewish Counsel in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="723">What sort of contacts he was making, was he telling you about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">ANSWER:  Well, with the Jewish Counsel, we always had contacts, because that was an official institution, as you know, which the Germans had all over the world when they had invaded a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">That was for them a very convenient, practical way of dealing with the Jewish question. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">To channel it through the Jews themselves which they did then, of course, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">They had a Jewish Counsel to whom they always said, "Look here, if you know, be quiet now and tell your people that nothing is going to happen," and so on and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">They are just going to move you to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Through these organizations they managed -- they had a very clever way of these deportations, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">They got, of course, experienced during the time how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So they made it, did it step-by-step like that, very often with the help of the Jewish Counsels who were in good faith and thought that this was going to be only moving us to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And we had contact with them and Raoul Wallenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">When he came, he had already a list of people not so much underground, but social democrats people and party people who were against Nazis and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">That, he had and so on, but the real contact with the fighting underground, I don't think that he had that from the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I had it then later on when it was the question about defending our <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">We foresaw the situation when the Germans who after all were a guarantee for our protection, when they evacuated and an interval until the Russians would come, when the criminals, the Hungarian officers would come over and there would be no rules whatsoever for diplomats, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">We foresaw a situation like that, and so I contacted then the underground, and they had promised to put people to our disposal for defending us. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And we ourselves bought weapons on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , machine guns, to protect ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Now, this situation never came about. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">They persecuted us and we were hiding, but it never came to fightings between us because when they were starting to persecute us and we were hiding, the Soviets arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">So they had no time for this period we had thought was coming.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">QUESTION:  In an interview that you gave at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uppsala</span> , you said you never took risks. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Do you agree with that, that you never took any risks? </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I want to ask you about a particular situation with a George Libnik (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  Ya, Libbik (ph).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="746">QUESTION:  Libbik (ph), where you went in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with him and loaned him your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> at some point. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Is that true?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">ANSWER:  What did I do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">QUESTION:  You gave him your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> so that he did some things by himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Oh, well, he was in all secrecy -- well, he was my official driver anyway, but I knew that he was the underground _, so I said, "You can have my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> during the night, I don't care." </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And I never asked him what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">But afterwards, he said, "I was just blowing up the munitions storage for the Germans," and all that, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">That would have been sort of a great risk for me in my situation towards Germans, so I -- but we saved -- together we saved his father-in-law, the Nobel Prize winner, Szent-Gyorgyi. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">That was the big thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">QUESTION:  What happened October 15th when the change really comes, when the Hungarians come and the Germans have left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">ANSWER:  Well, that was a chaotic, chaotic day. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I was -- it so happened that I was at the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> to send off the remaining Swedish colony, the Swedish ladies with their children and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And when I had managed to put them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with German troops, but we had managed to get one part of it for our purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">When on the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in the loudspeaker you all of a sudden heard that now, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> is free and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> is going to -- is leaving the war, making peace treaty and here and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">So there's not going to be any more fightings for us and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And everybody started to wonder what is happening now. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">That was the attempt by Herr Holte (ph), you remember, to jump the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and he was immediately stopped and they shot his son, Nickolas Holte (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And after a while came a new message from the loudspeakers saying well, this was a complete mistake, what you just heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">It's going on, the war's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And I said to myself what am I going to do now with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swedish transport</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And the Germans said, "Oh, now, there will be fightings during the way here and when we leave here, and there will be bombings," and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">So I faced the situation either to send off these people or to stop it. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And it was a terrible responsibility, but I said to myself I don't think it can be worse, after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">I think it would be worse to stay on, so I gave the signal to leave and then I couldn't sleep, of course, that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">But after a while, I think some days, I heard that they had safely arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , all of them and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">And then the whole situation in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was then the Nazis had taken over everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Salinger had been appointed the new Prime Minister, and they canceled officially all the protective passports and they started to attack, invade all the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish houses</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">So that was the worst day of the whole -- during this whole period, I would say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">QUESTION:  At this point in September, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wallenberg</span> is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> , ya.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">QUESTION:  So that you're not as close geographically as you were before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  Well, we were -- well, the whole thing was as before was the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">We communicated every day with each other and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">So the difference was that the Nazi government had taken over, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">That was the situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">QUESTION:  Approximately how many people at this point in October had protective passes insofar as you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">ANSWER:  Well, we had about, say, about 20,000 like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">We had the official permission for 4,500, but in all secrecy we were hiding three times as many in these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">QUESTION:  And at the same time, the other legations, the other neutral . . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">ANSWER:  They also had a great number.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">QUESTION:  So there were many, many thousands of people under so-called protection?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="788">ANSWER:  Ya.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="789">QUESTION:  So immediately these undermined by the...
ANSWER:  Not all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Of course, you don't do that quickly, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">It takes time. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">So the first thing which happened was -- which was very critical situation also when they later on invaded the Swedish Red Cross, <span class="BUILDING">Langley's office</span> and sort of stopped the whole Red Cross activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">And then our negotiations with them, with the Nazis, was that if you go on like this, we have to leave this, cut off the diplomatic relations with <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , which in a way they didn't want. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">That was the only card we had to play, could play, promising the whole time that one day we will recognize you here and you will be -- I said to the Foreign Minister of the cabinet, you see, "You'll be the first Ambassador to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">You are so respected and so clever and so, you know." </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And he was sort of very happy with this idea to be an ambassador in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> after the war had been won. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">They still thought that the Germans were going to win the war, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">That was the card we play against the instructions from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Said that never, ever will be recognized, this government.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="800">QUESTION:  I'm going to go a little bit <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the particular situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">What is it like for somebody to negotiate with people with whom you have so little respect?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="802">ANSWER:  You have to mobilize all your efforts and you have to try to copy him in a way of some brutal sort of -- you shouldn't say that and be polite and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Like Wallenberg did, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">He used the same hard, very hard language and said as I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I negotiated with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Of course, this was how we divided the work, that Raoul Wallenberg, he went and saw everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I mean, Eichmann, and all those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I tried to follow the diplomatic rules only to have the contact with the <span class="BUILDING">front office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="809">So I negotiated quite often with Kamienna (ph) about this, and he was not a normal person really. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">He was a fanatic and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Raoul Wallenberg had another advantage because he knew his wife who had once upon a time approached Raoul Wallenberg to ask him, "Can I help in a way?" </span><span class="sentence" id="812">and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">So he used that channel more; I didn't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">But I negotiated with him officially from the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span> which had the effect he over radio announced; then later on, that it was a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">The Swedish protective passports are still valid. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">That was the Raoul Wallenberg's sort of -- the result of his efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="817">QUESTION:  You smiled when you mentioned the Baroness Kamienna (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="818">There were rumors that they had some sort of a relationship, she and Wallenberg.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">ANSWER:  Of course, it is very easy to draw that conclusion, but, of course, I didn't know how Raoul Wallenberg acted on his private hours and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">But I'm quite sure that that never happened, anything more than she wanted to help, and he used her as a tool towards her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">So that's -- but it's interesting how in the film with Richard Chamberlain how -- this Hollywood film -- how they developed that a little bit more. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">That he went to the <span class="BUILDING">railway station</span> to say goodbye to her; that is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">That he did, and he also went there with flowers to say goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">That he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">When she was leaving for <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , she was expecting a child with Kamienna (ph), and she wanted to have that child born in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="826">She left and he went to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> to thank her for all that she had done to help and gave her some roses. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">In this film, I don't know whether you saw it, but it's very interesting to see how Raoul Wallenberg comes to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and he's standing behind a corner and look, when Baron Kamienna (ph) says goodbye to his wife and then he leaves, and then <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> starts to move and Raoul Wallenberg jumps up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , comes in with a bottle of champagne and the flowers. "</span><span class="sentence" id="828">Here, are you going with me to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="829">Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">I have bribed the people in the next <span class="BUILDING">station</span> and they're going to stop the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> next <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I wanted to say goodbye to you." </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Typical Hollywood sort of product, but it was very amusing to see this. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">No, she's -- and there's a beautiful British actress who plays her role in this film, and I asked this Mrs. Kamienna (ph) once, "What do you think about the film?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="834">Well, it was a good film, but, you see, I was much prettier than that girl."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">QUESTION:  There were forced marches from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> east -- west to the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">You and Raoul Wallenberg went with a driver in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">What did you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">ANSWER:  Well, we saw all these terrible marches. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">You know, people were taken -- it was the time when all <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railway transports</span> were impossible because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was cut off and they were bombed -- the railway connections were bombed and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">So they took the people as they stood and walked in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , took them and pushed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">That was the -- also, Hungarian soldiers were mobilized for that, marched this whole way from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Debrecen</span> (ph), and that is the <span class="BUILDING">border station</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , about 200 kilometers or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">It took a week to march this, and they died on the way, many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">There was snow and it was cold, and they had to spend the night in the open <span class="DLF">air</span> and all that; it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And we had with us some foodstuff we were distributing and so on, but the main was that when we came to this <span class="BUILDING">border station</span> , we or Raoul to get back quite a few of them who had Swedish passports or he bluffed and got them back anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">There are so many stories about that, it would take too long to tell you all these different situations and also showing his inventiveness and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">But typical is one which a Jewish survivor told me once, and that is when they were standing, a group of about 50 students, Jewish students, waiting for being handed over to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Raoul Wallenberg approached them and said, "Are there anyone here who -- or is there anyone here who has a Swedish passport, protective passport?" </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And there were only two came forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">But then he said, "Well, but you must all remember that the other day the authorities confiscated lots of your passports, and don't you remember that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Oh, yes, they remembered, and the whole crowd came forward, and we then organized transports back to their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And there were the Germans, and, of course, it was a combination of our status and all that and that he also had some bottles and things with him, and he sort of distributed -- let his drivers distribute little gifts to the Germans around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">QUESTION:  When were these marches occurring? </span><span class="sentence" id="853">It was after October?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="854">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">It was in December. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">In December.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">QUESTION:  And what did you do, I mean, when you went with Raoul? </span><span class="sentence" id="858">I mean, do tell a few incidences of when you were with him and what you actually saw and what you did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="859">ANSWER:  Well, I helped him as much as I could, and, you see, prior to that I helped him, also, as often as I could in spite of other jobs I had especially to coordinate, you know, all these actions, also headache with Langley and with our foreign interests and the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">We had Soviets and citizens there and Soviet prisoners of war and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">But I remember one day, I remember when I was writing my book, I sent the manuscript to my publisher and he said, "Ah, I think it's good. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">It's a good book. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">But I refuse to publish this book if you don't say anything of what you did yourself." </span><span class="sentence" id="864">Well, I said, "I haven't written this book for writing about myself." "</span><span class="sentence" id="865">Well, you have to." </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And then I didn't know what to do, but all of a sudden a friend sent me a book called "When Six Million People Died." </span><span class="sentence" id="867">And I looked in the index and found my name, and he related an episode when Raoul Wallenberg telephoned me and said, "I'm so busy now, I'm going to run that <span class="NPIP">place</span> to save people. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">But I know that now at this and that <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , there is a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> leaving and there might be Swedish people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Please, can you take over?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="870">Of course." </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And I went there and used the same language as Raoul, and there was a German officer and I said, "Open the <span class="DLF">doors</span> ," and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And I came into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and there were about 100 people there, and I said, "Those who have Swedish passports, come forward." </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And there were only a few of them, one or two or three -- I've forgotten now. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And then I said, "But I know that I recognize you here. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">I have seen you in the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish houses</span> , and have you forgotten your passport? </span><span class="sentence" id="876">What's happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="877">And don't you have any paper that you can show that you have had a pass?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="878">Oh, yes." </span><span class="sentence" id="879">They took and showed Hungarian papers, driving licenses, and receipts or whatever in Hungarian language which the Germans, of course, couldn't read. "</span><span class="sentence" id="880">Oh, that proves that you have a Swedish passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Come. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Come with me." </span><span class="sentence" id="883">And they came out, all of them, and then I had as my help a Hungarian officer, a police officer was in our service in a way unofficially and his two dogs and in full uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And I said, "You take care of these people." </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And the Germans thought that he was going to take them to a <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian jail</span> or something, but he marched away, straight away to the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish houses</span> and put them in there, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">That kind of bluff, I learned that from Raoul, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">It wasn't my invention at all, but you asked me about if I did anything and that is an example. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I said if that has been described in one book, why couldn't I relate it in my own?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">QUESTION:  Was it frightening to do this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">ANSWER:  No, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">I had also a certain experience to talk to Germans because of my previous assignment to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I spoke their language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="893">QUESTION:  But when the was in, when the Hungarian Nazis were in, certainly you had to be taking more and more risks. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="894">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="895">QUESTION:  ... for your own life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="896">ANSWER:  Oh, that was, of course, a different situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="898">QUESTION:  Is there anything between October and December when you get the cable from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> that you want to talk about that's going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="899">Is the situation now just becoming more and more chaotic?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="900">ANSWER:  Ya. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">Also, that was slowly, it was deteriorating and the bombing started, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="902">QUESTION:  When did the bombing start?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">ANSWER:  Well, the bombings of the allies, the air force and all that was going more sporadically to start with, but it was then concentrated very much towards the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And then when the Russians were surrounding the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , they were shooting artillery into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And the worst -- absolutely the worst situation was, of course, when they took to the <span class="REGION">Pest side</span> first, and we were then separated from Raoul Wallenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">He happened to be on that <span class="NPIP">side</span> when they came, and we were on the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">We never knew, you know, where the Russians were coming first. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">It looked as though they were going into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , the <span class="REGION">Buda side</span> , they were first. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">Because they came to surroundings of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , which stopped the Nazis for a while to persecute us who were on that <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="910">On the <span class="REGION">Pest side</span> , nothing had happened, but always it was kind of surprise they attacked <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> first in the beginning of January and went through the <span class="INT_SPACE">underground</span> to <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">caves</span> and come in the back of the Germans and all that, and the Germans then panicked, tore for the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> and tried to get over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> where they were sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">And that remains then in the German hands another month till they then attacked us. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">But during that time, it was the most terrible time from the viewpoint of the war because then the Soviets put on their artillery on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pest</span> and shooting direct fire up on us and destroying the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">royal palace</span> and all the other <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And we were sitting -- if you stay first in the first war, you move down and you ended up down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">caves</span> where we were spending our last time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">QUESTION:  Where were you getting food from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="915">ANSWER:  Well, we had some stored tins and sort of foodstuff, but we lived the last time up in the Buda side on a, say, one potato soup a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Everything was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">The electricity, the water, nothing exists any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">So we put on all -- we took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> from a <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> and put it down on the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> and had some wood, and we were making fire in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">We had to pick up some water from a <span class="DLF">dam</span> on <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the open which was really useful if there were wood, fires and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">That was yellow stuff, water which was not very tasty. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And we cooked those potatoes and had a meal every day of potato soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">It's interesting how man can survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="923">QUESTION:  When you received that telegram when you talked about everybody standing and saying that they would stay, when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> thought that you were risk, there were two women -- no, actually, three on the staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Two secretaries and Asta Nielsen from Save the Children, yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="925">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="926">QUESTION:  And were they involved in this discussion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="927">ANSWER:  Certainly, all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And they were -- Asta Nielsen was, of course, she was in charge of this saving children and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Absolutely, she was staying, she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And the two other girls, we told them that you have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">And one of them said she was engaged to be married to a Hungarian, and we really didn't need the girls any longer, and we understood that they were going to take great risks when the Russians were coming and all that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="932">QUESTION:  You mean, as women?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="933">ANSWER:  Ya, ya. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">So she said okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">She accepted then to leave with the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">We were driving over in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in December, in the middle of December just before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">But the other girl, she started to cry and say, "Oh, you don't trust me, and why should I leave here? </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And I want to be with you and help," and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">She was Marguerite Ball (ph) was her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">So we couldn't convince her to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so we said, "Okay, you stay." </span><span class="sentence" id="941">So she was staying with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="942">QUESTION:  And did her work change? </span><span class="sentence" id="943">I mean, obviously, with the situation deteriorating everybody is doing...
ANSWER:  Ya, she was still helping to send cables to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="944">We could communicate with <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> till Christmas when we were then invaded by the Nazis, and they cut off all our communications with <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="945">So in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , they didn't know what happened to us from Christmas '44 till the end of March. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">We completely disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">The Soviets never communicated with <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> about what happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Raoul Wallenberg, they told <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> that Raoul Wallenberg, he is under our protection and nothing is going to happen to him and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">So in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> they were very concerned what had happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">With Raoul Wallenberg, oh, he is safe and he is coming <span class="BUILDING">home</span> one day, which he never did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Let's change the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">End of Tape 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Tape 3
QUESTION:  Let's talk about those last few weeks a little bit more. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">Were you able to see Wallenberg pretty much every day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="956">ANSWER:  Not every day, but we tried to have a contact to eliminate the risks for the whole staff, for him, for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">We were never staying, all of us, in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And we were moving very often from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">We never -- tried to never spend every night in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And there he was, of course, with his knapsack and his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleeping bag</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="961">He had a greater advantage to move around in there, I mean in that respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">So, but we had a kind of communication, so to start with he tried to come over to our <span class="NPIP">part</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And he knew day-by-day where I am going to stay, and I knew where he was going to stay pretty regularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And I went over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> now and then and so on, and then, as I say and I write in my book, the last time he came was the 10th of January 1945 when he comes up to the Buda side on the <span class="DLF">hills</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And it was a situation where the bombs were falling down all around and all that, and we were going to see a general, an SS general, who was sitting deep under in the <span class="INT_SPACE">caves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">You know, from the historical time, once upon a time, long ago when the Turks were dominating that part of the world, they had sort of big underground caves which were in existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">So I remember from our small <span class="DLF">cave</span> we had in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I was staying for a while, you had the connections you could go further down. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">There was, for instance, the International Red Cross had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> there, and that is the place where tens of thousands Hungarians took refuge. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">They went there the day when the Russians were encircling the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and the final fightings were starting. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And thinking that they were going to sit there a couple of days; they were there three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">You see, you can imagine the situation among those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">I went down there down then and saw it, without food and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">They had some perhaps some water to drink and all that and so on, but most of those people survived after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">How they looked when they came up to the surface is another question. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">So there were all these people underground in those <span class="INT_SPACE">caves</span> sitting there waiting for the Russians to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And there also the Germans had the commandos, so there was an SS general sitting there with his staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And Raoul and I went to him because we wanted to have some more -- some guarantees from the Germans that they, after all, should try to help to protect our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , you see, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">That is the situation when this German says to Raoul Wallenberg that "You are our greatest enemy ever, and you are hiding in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> one of the underground fighters, Hungarians. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And how could you do that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And then Raoul Wallenberg answers that "I don't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I have never been hiding someone." </span><span class="sentence" id="982">His name was Deuschufee (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="983">He was a journalist and he was underground fighter and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">I knew him very well, so I said to this general "Well, look here. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">I can guarantee that he's not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">We are never hiding anybody." </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And that was our principle, we were never hiding anyone in the real <span class="BUILDING">embassy building</span> or in our private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> because we didn't want to risk our own existence, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">If they discovered that, we would have been deported ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I mean, to be able to continue our work, we had to respect those kind of rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">So the people we were hiding were all in the <span class="BUILDING">protective houses</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">And he said, "Well, look, I know better." </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And that is the strange story that when I meet this man again, Deuschufee (ph) was his name, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> when I was posted there and he was then in the government, the liberal government for one year after Russians took over, 1946, '47, and he was one member of the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">So he came to a big conference in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cairo</span> , and we were sitting together one evening, and I told him the story about this absurd story. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And he started to laugh and say, "Well, of course, I was there the whole time, but you didn't know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">I was hiding in one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> there which you didn't know about. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">I knew this old <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I knew it very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">So I was hiding in the one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there, and I so very often saw you and Raoul sitting having dinner there over the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="998">But I never told you." </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And it's strange then that this German knew it, but he didn't dare to go into that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> because it was Raoul Wallenberg, it was a Swedish diplomat's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">He never violated that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">That was a typical example of this German sort of -- this correct sort of attitude they tried to maintain with every Swede.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1002">QUESTION:  And Raoul didn't know it either, Raoul Wallenberg?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1003">ANSWER:  Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">So that is when I said to Raoul, "Now, you have really -- now, you have done the job here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">Now, you have to think of your own safety absolutely because the whole situation is completely hopeless as chaotic and all that," and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">And that is when he says, "But you see, I can't stop now any longer because I can never return to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> without knowing that I've done as much as I can to save as many people as possible." </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">That is his last word to me, the 10th of January. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">Then he returns to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">The Germans withdraw, blew up the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , and Raoul is arrested by the Soviet troops.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1011">QUESTION:  Did you try to convince him after he said that to stay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1012">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">He didn't listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">You can only speculate on what could have happened if he had stayed on with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1015">QUESTION:  He had and showed you plans for the rehabilitation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> or the helping of people after the war; is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1016">ANSWER:  Ya.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1017">QUESTION:  What did this entail?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1018">ANSWER:  Well, you see, this also I think contributed to the suspicions, the Russians' suspicions because he very proudly he told them the story about the future here now will be that I, Swedish diplomat and all that, I am going to stay on and I am going to reorganize this humanitarian action. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I'm going to see to it that the family will be reunited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">That the property is put back to the Jewish people, and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And some author has said that he was politically naive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And my answer to that is weren't we all very naive, the whole <span class="REGION">western world</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">I mean, we accepted the Soviets because they helped to defeat the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , when I told the people that I'm completely convinced that the Soviets had arrested Raoul, that how could you say things like that about the Soviets, our great helper? </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">They have helped us to defeat the Nazis, the Nazi system and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">And the whole <span class="REGION">western world</span> said the same thing till 1948, at least, until <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> situation then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">So we all thought -- we thought ourselves as soon as the Soviets arrive, we will reestablish our <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">We will continue our work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">They didn't want any foreigners to remain on the <span class="REGION">territory</span> which they were going to occupy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">So all the <span class="BUILDING">embassies</span> were taken away like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1032">QUESTION:  Let me go back a little bit again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">Between October 15th and December after Christmas when it becomes really impossible to do very much except to save oneself, how is it that you or Wallenberg find out that a particular action is going to happen someplace and that he goes to try and save people? </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">I mean, how do these messages get transmitted so that you know where to go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1035">ANSWER:  Well, you know this big organization he had was, of course, consisted also of younger sort of boys, whatever, and were running between the different <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">And they had the information from- we -- I am sure that Raoul Wallenberg had that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">There weren't so many of these <span class="BUILDING">railway stations</span> ; there were one or two only. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">I am convinced that the -- and yes, I know that he had some people there who observed the situation and reported immediately to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">So that wasn't such -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> isn't that big a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , so they could bicycle back to him or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">It wasn't complicated, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1041">QUESTION:  Were things like this done once a day, more than that when he would go out? </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">I mean, what kind of situation are we talking about when we talk about not simply saving people by giving them the passes which are obviously very significant, but also going out and doing something, which was what was unusual, when you and he went out or he went out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1043">ANSWER:  Well, it was all certainly a combination of all this that he -- first, we had the protective passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">The people lodged in our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , that's one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">But once that was done, it was the question to try to save more people than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And also to find if by chance some people without a passport had been deported or were on the way to be deported, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">So that became a routine in a way to check on that when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were leaving for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or the death marches later on, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">So that was complementary to this first more or less organized sanction by the government and all that; that was one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">The other thing was to try to -- I had hoped to help people who were on the way to be deported and then comes, of course, the big risky operation which Raoul Wallenberg didn't form himself, but indirectly through his presence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">You see, it's also interesting with Raoul Wallenberg which is very well described by Levi in the first book which appeared just after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">He says something like that Raoul Wallenberg became the observing eye, so to say, which -- the conscience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">He became kind of a something which the Nazis feared in a way that his mere presence stopped them from going still further in a way sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And an example of that is, of course, that when one of the collaborators, I don't think that Raoul Wallenberg was present himself, heard that the Hungarian officers were going to blow up the whole, so to say, international -- our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in their desperation because they couldn't deport any people any longer because, you see, they were just being encircled by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Then he took upon him to say in Raoul's words that Raoul Wallenberg is sending a message to you, General Schmitthuber (ph), who was the last remaining army general. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">I mean, not SS, but the army general in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="1056">If you don't stop this action which the <span class="BUILDING">Hungarian offices</span> are planning, I'll see to it that you will be hanged as a war criminal after the war." </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">And then the general stopped this action; 70,000 people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1058">QUESTION:  What do you think they were actually intending, machine-gunning people or bombing it or does anyone know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1059">ANSWER:  Well, there were both, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">Putting the fire and then shooting them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1061">QUESTION:  So this was an intermediary who called this general and said this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1062">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">So that -- in Richard Chamberlain's film, they have -- it's more dramatic, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">Raoul Wallenberg is running to Schmitthuber (ph) and telling all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">It never happened, but anyhow it doesn't make a difference because the people were saved thanks to his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1066">QUESTION:  This is rather extraordinary that one person would have such an impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">When you knew him as a younger man, would you have been able to predict that he would have such ingenuity and initiative and a kind of fearlessness in such a difficult situation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1068">ANSWER:  No, I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">I think he grew with the task, as we all do, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">That he -- I'm not astonished at all that he became that kind of a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">He -- we all came into a situation where we thought that this 1s going to be a fowl couple of months and kind of really had a cross section of people we saved and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">I don't think that we ever thought of -- first of all, we never thought of the danger we were in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">And the second thing is we never thought of the dimensions -- the enormous dimensions it would take; I mean, the magnitude of this operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">We were not dreaming of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Raoul Wallenberg in a way was forced into an operation which became much bigger than he ever thought of.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1076">QUESTION:  Did the other legations -- because other legations ran safe <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> also -- did they also have such a large staff, do you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1077">ANSWER:  No, they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">They had also Jewish volunteers and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">Of course, the Swiss were the next biggest, but the other were the small actions, the Portuguese and the Spanish and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1080">QUESTION:  Did you know Gyorgyi Polaska (ph) from the Spanish sector?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1081">ANSWER:  Well, I don't know -- well, I heard his name many times now and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And he was the Spanish sort of chargé d'affaires, they called him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">He called himself an ambassador, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">Like Hungarian Count Pongras (ph), whom I knew very well, he called himself Ambassador of <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">Of course, when those ambassadors left, they gave over everything to locally employed people, which they knew, so they took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">And it's interesting to see how in the documents which also are produced in Levi's book when we made joint interventions for the government, they were signed by ; my boss, by Lutz (ph), or Feller (ph) was my opposite, a young , Count Pongras (ph) and so on, Ambassador of <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">And so there were always a sort of a joint -- very often joint interventions from the neutral countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1088">QUESTION:  Can you explain what that means for people who don't know what that means when you say "a joint intervention"?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1089">ANSWER:  Well, that we all go together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">I mean, that we go together, the four or three or four or five, the neutrals presented -- go together to the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> and present a paper signed by all of us that we protest against this action you have taken against whatever, our nationals or against people under our protection and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1091">QUESTION:  In those situations, you present a document?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1092">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1094">QUESTION:  Is there then a discussion or is it simply a formal presentation and then...
ANSWER:  Oh, well, it could be followed by discussions, of course, at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1096">QUESTION:  But a very formalized kind of...
ANSWER:  Well, Raoul Wallenberg was often initiated to this, of course, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1097">QUESTION:  So he sometimes was part of the discussions in the interventions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1098">ANSWER:  Oh, ya, ya.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1099">QUESTION:  And did he act differently than the rest of you in those situations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1100">ANSWER:  Beg your pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1101">QUESTION:  Did he act differently in those situations or was he acting in a diplomatic fashion in those interventions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1102">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">Well, it was different depending on the situation, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">There was no special -- you can't say there was any special rules for how to act. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">You always had to adopt yourself after the situation and improvise and all that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1106">QUESTION:  Talk to me a little bit about neutrality and what that means and what you felt given all that you saw about your government's own neutrality.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1107">ANSWER:  Well, you see, the neutrality is a concept which has been very much discussed, of course, especially now in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> in this completely new situation today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">But neutrality for us during the war was, of course, that we tried not to take sides, not to be in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">A very egotistical sort of policy that you try to save your life, your own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">That's perhaps quite natural in a way, and so on, but neutrality speaking of the time during the war, of course, if you are smart and you have adapted a little bit, changed it a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">So I think that the Swedish government was very anxious towards the end of the war to be more pro-allied than they were just at the beginning of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And that's no longer, I'm not -- no one should be astonished about that kind of a situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">So from having had given in for the Germans in the beginning when we didn't know if they were going to invade us or not, 1t was permitting <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> with soldiers through <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , German soldiers and all that, and delivering iron ore to them and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">At the time we diminished all this like that, so towards the end of the war we didn't give the Germans any favor whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">We were more favorable towards the allied countries and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And I'm sure that that was also part of our -- well, the political, 1t was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Of course, humanitarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">Of course, this was help for the Jewish people, but I think it was well in <span class="DLF">line</span> with our policy towards the end of the war that we show up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">Look here, what we have done for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">We have helped the Jewish people, and we have been fighting against the Germans, the Nazis in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and all that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1121">QUESTION:  Were you ever upset that your government had not done more for rescuing people? </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">In other words, do you think there was a time that they might have?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1123">ANSWER:  Ya, I think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And that is very well illustrated by a friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">His name is Steve Koblik. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">Perhaps you have heard about him; he's a historian, Jewish historian at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">And he wrote a book, first in Swedish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">He speaks Swedish like a Swede because he's married to Swedish lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And it appeared a couple of years later, the same book in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">It's called "If the Stones Cry Out." </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">It's from the Bible, that if you are silent -- you can't keep that silent because the stones will cry out, is from Jesus, sort of a chapter in the Bible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And he wrote that book and that is just about the Swedish situation towards the Jewish people in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> between 1930- something when the Nazis started off in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> till the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">Where he tells us who doesn't know it -- I knew it, of course -- and the Swiss were in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">How we had no visa with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">The Germans could freely come to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> without visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And then the Swiss government and the Swedish government asked the Germans, "But how do we know if there are any Jewish people among those people?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="1137">Well, we'll see to it that they put a J in the passport." </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And those people were stopped at the borders of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , the borders of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , because the Swedish trade unions, the Swedish doctors, one special one person in the Swedish government was anti-Semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">They said we -- and the Jewish people themselves and that is terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">The Jewish people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> said, "Don't let any" -- quoting him now the whole time, as you understand, in his book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">They were saying according to his words that "For God's sake, don't let any Jewish people come into <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because there will be a Jewish problem in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">You see, that reflects the whole atmosphere in Europe or in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or wherever you are in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">I mean, in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , In <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , they know pretty well what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">Six million people at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And they had in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> the problem to create the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">To create the State of Israel, they wanted to be on good terms with the British, and the British were in the dilemma that they didn't want to have too many Jewish people coming to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because there would be conflict with the Arabs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">This is policy the whole time, the whole time, see, which stopped the possibility of taking in more Jewish people at that time to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">So if you ask and I'm quite straightforward to you in this question, because I think that the whole world, the whole world is guilty in this situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And how then he describes then how we comes further in this situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">When the war breaks out, <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> was in a very great danger to be occupied by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">1942, when we reported that the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> existed and when Roosevelt got the same report in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , there was great anti-Semitic feelings here, so there was not published at all anything from the government about these <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1152"><span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">But if I talk about <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , I think we could have sort of brought out this to the public in, say, in 1943, when you could see that the war is not going to be won by the Germans, and after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And as Koblik says in his book, he means that if <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , a neutral country, or <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , a neutral country, would have published in big headlines what's going on, it would perhaps have given the Germans second thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">That they would have not stopped, but slowed down this whole action. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And above all, he says in his book it would have given the Jewish people an information from neutral countries, where they must tell the truth, after all, about this and would perhaps have given the Jewish people a more feeling to resist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">You might take all this what I have told you now, I'm not saying that it's my opinion at all like that, but I think it's very interesting that an American author, an American historian puts forward all these arguments here against the whole world which did nothing to help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1158">QUESTION:  Did you think there could have been more Jewish resistance in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1159">ANSWER:  If there could have been?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1160">QUESTION:  Could there have been more Jewish resistance? </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">Were you...
ANSWER:  I mean, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> they were fighting towards the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">There might have been other situations, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">That's only very political. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">What would have happened if they had attacked the ghetto in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> like they attacked the ghetto in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">Would the Hungarians have made the same resistance there? </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1168">QUESTION:  You've probably heard the debate about bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1169">ANSWER:  Ya.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1170">QUESTION:  Do you think that had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> been bombed, that these Hungarians would have been killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">I mean, what did you think about the argument about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1172">ANSWER:  I think that's -- it was the Head of the War Liberty Board who initiated or proposed this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And not only bombing, above all bombing the <span class="DLF">lines</span> between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , so he was very active in suggesting this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">The answer was and that is, of course, very much because of the Soviet attitude because the allies were very -- there was a great similarity with the Soviets because they were, after all, helping to -- they were saving British or American lives in putting in so much force themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">So if the Russians said no, we are not in war just to protect the Jewish people, we veto that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">And we have no time, we have our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> for other purposes, namely, to kill Germans, and that's not at all for this purpose you suggest, they told them, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">And I think that's a terrible thing because it wouldn't have cost them more than one or two bombs to throw down on these connection lines. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">That would have stopped, at least they would have saved hundreds of thousands of people just stopping that deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">So that's terrible, but it's very easy also, of course, afterward to sit down there and say you should have done that and you should have done that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">One really has to also try to see it how was the real situation and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">So it's very difficult to judge, but from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> like this, I think it was a great mistake not at least to bomb the <span class="DLF">connection lines</span> within <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">I think that would have helped a lot to save many people's lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1183">QUESTION:  You, in an interview at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Uppsala</span> , commented on a question that a filmmaker had asked you that had one of you returned from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , not just Raoul Wallenberg, what do you think would have been the feelings, the understandings of what everybody did? </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">I think the question has something to do with when one person is taken and other people who have also done many things came back, does that enlarge the reputation of Raoul Wallenberg, because he was the one who obviously suffered after the war in a way that the rest of you didn't.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1185">ANSWER:  Well, I think that the mere fact that we all stood up behind Raoul Wallenberg, and even if we were not -- every person were not engaged 100 percent like Raoul Wallenberg in saving people like that, at least at the beginning we had so many other things to do, and we were working day and night, especially before he came, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">But after he came, for me, the main task was to keep this together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">I mean, 1t could have easily ended up in a big catastrophe if he made mistakes which would have, after all, frustrated the Germans that much that they would stopped everything, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">So there was a balance the whole time, and I think because that we had this big organization, because we had an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> with a reputation of being correct and that and having the relations with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and all that, Raoul Wallenberg with all what he did and so on, he could never have acted on his own alone, never. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">So even if he and every person didn't do the same job as he did, the mere fact that he was there, that the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> was there, that was the whole base for his action, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">So we both helped each other in one way or another as much as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">So, I mean, did the question you asked was -- I don't...
QUESTION:  Well, I think what the filmmaker was asking was if all of you had been caught by the Russians, as you were, you then were sent back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">If all of you had been caught and not sent back, would everyone's reputation have been different? </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">Would there be this -- in other words, there is a way in which people understand the situation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> as one hero, and that's clearly not how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">Because alone Raoul Wallenberg could not have possibly have done what he did, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">So I think his question to you has to do with the reasons why the reputation is so much larger than other people's.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1196">ANSWER:  Ya. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">Well, I think I understand what you mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">And, of course, suppose that nobody had come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">Of course, still Raoul Wallenberg would have got most of the credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Of course, he did the job more than we did, but I think that we would have been recognized also for being his supporters and the base for his action. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">I think especially in the perspective perhaps not the first day after the discovery, but in a perspective now with all historians looking to this, I think they would have today to say that today we would still be there somewhere or killed or died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">Today, they would have analyzed the situation, and they would have come to this conclusion, as I told you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1203">QUESTION:  Were you a balance for him, both as a person and as representing a more -- well, the <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span> because he was not trained as a diplomat? </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">He wasn't coming there to be a diplomat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">Was there a way in which you...
ANSWER:  Ya, of course, that was part of my job to balance between -- of course, when he came first, the other staff, I mean, the other people in the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> , for them it was a very strange situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">Here's an outsider coming and he takes over and he acts on his own, and this is being an arms operation and what's going on here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">I remember when I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> in August, I'd been <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with my wife and all that and came back with some more people, ___—__ and so on for helping, Asta Nielsen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">Wallenberg had already been in action then for a month when I came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">And the whole <span class="BUILDING">embassy building</span> was filled with Jewish applicants in the <span class="DLF">garden</span> and all over, and he was distributing passports to all of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">And the staff were upset, and I said, "Now, take it easy, take it easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">I'll talk to Raoul about this." </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And when he heard my arguments, he understood completely what I was aiming at; namely, that if we now established a big rescue operation in the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> here along those <span class="DLF">lines</span> you are thinking of, we will not have any possibility to act as an <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> any longer with our ordinary work, and we won't be recognized any longer as the Oder (ph) Swedish Embassy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">We will be a big rescue kind of <span class="BUILDING">station</span> here, so, please, now, you have to organize this another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And he understood immediately what I was aiming at. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">So he had these volunteer people and they established his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on the Pest side and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">So the whole situation calmed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And then after that, the whole staff completely understood the situation and especially when I continued my discussions with Raoul and said, "You have to stick to these criteria the whole time because we have to have vis-a-vis the Germans a correct bureaucracy for what we are doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And we can't give away protective passports to anyone like that, at least not now in the beginning when everything is comparatively calm here and we can work in all quiet," and all that and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">Which didn't prevent him, of course, towards the end when everything was falling into pieces and all the bombing and all that that he could distribute protective passes to anyone he wanted to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">That was the next situation when you couldn't lose anything on doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">But the whole start, it was absolutely necessary to make that along as corrective lines as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">As correct as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1223">QUESTION:  And he had no trouble understanding that there had to be...
ANSWER:  Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">He understood it completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">So, but that was a part of my diplomatic training, and he being a clever businessman making business and all that, you see, in his way of acting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1228">QUESTION:  How did you understand his passion for wanting to come over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to save Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">Did he ever explain what -- it's not the most usual decision to make.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1230">ANSWER:  No, I understood it in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">I understood it because I knew from years before in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> when we were both young and all that that he always stood up for young people who were badly treated by their comrades and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And in the military service also, we were together there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">He always stood up for weaker people, and he also had this kind of enthusiasm for helping and ideas and inventiveness and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">So from that I understood in a way -- understood it, perhaps not 100 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">That I understand now much better when I'm reading -- I read the letters between him and his grandfather where you see how his character develops and how he comes here to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and he studies at <span class="BUILDING">Michigan University</span> and how he wholeheartedly accepts the American way of life, the freedom, democracy and integrity of man and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">And with those impressions, he then comes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hallefors</span> where he meets the first Jewish refugees, and I'm absolutely convinced that when he saw this, that they were unheard of stories, that he said to himself, "I have to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">Absolutely, I can't be passive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">I have to do something for helping." </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And then it so happened that he comes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> and works with a Jewish businessman there, and he gets the story from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> what's happening there and so on and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1240">QUESTION:  When you helped Mr. Wall (ph) who came to see you that night, would you say that your -- not appreciation of the problem -- but your decision to help came from him coming to that <span class="DLF">door</span> , and then you -- sort of the <span class="DLF">door</span> would not close anymore in a certain way? </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">This was not a plan in your head that you were going to go out and save the Jews either?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1242">ANSWER:  No, because it came that early, so I hadn't faced the situation really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">But he described it to me, of course, and the following days we saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">We saw how they were queuing up <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">We saw that this is very serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">So that's no doubt how you get more and more involved in this, how it grows and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">And I was asked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> when I was there in November, we discussed at the symposium or whatever what characterized a humanitarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">That is really not an easy question to answer, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">So I could only exemplify it by telling the story about Raoul Wallenberg and saying that I think in Raoul Wallenberg's case, he was born humanitarian in a way, because he had these feelings for always helping in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">He helped the weaker children there who were terrorized by the stronger ones and all that, and it's also interesting that this one man who was with him -- his name now was Pleti (ph) or something -- who was with Raoul Wallenberg in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> when they were going to and Raoul disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And he said just as they were leaving "Oh, no, I can't follow you because I don't know where my parents are now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">I have to find them." </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">So he left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and saved his life, of course, in doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">And he told the story that they met, they knew each other from the beginning from prior years in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> where they were studying at the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and this little Pleti (ph) was a small little boy, Jewish, weak, and how the older people, the stronger boys, they were terrorizing him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">And then Raoul Wallenberg went straight up to him and said, "Don't be afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">I'll protect you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">So he protected him against the others, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">So having heard all these stories, I came to the conclusion that he was born the humanitarian in a way, and I told the audience that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">And if you apply that on other people on myself and so on, I don't call me humanitarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">But if you would call me humanitarian, I would say that I became that when I was facing the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">That I didn't have sort of -- I wasn't born that way, I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">I can't judge myself, but we all who have faced the situation like that, how could you have done nothing? </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">I mean, you had to, you had to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1265">QUESTION:  When you went back -- you were kept for what, a month, two months by the Russians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1266">ANSWER:  Ya, we were kept, say, from the beginning of February till the beginning of April.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1267">QUESTION:  How were you treated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1268">ANSWER:  Well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">Correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">And that was also the peculiar situation that the Soviets had two armies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">One army occupied <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> , that was the Marshal or General Maddenowsky (ph) and conquered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> in one month before they took over, the Russians took over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> was another general, his name was Turbuchon (ph), and they didn't see eye-to-eye; they were rivals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">So they never communicated between themselves, see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">And on the <span class="REGION">Buda side</span> , we had no signs of being out helping Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">We had no <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> with Swedish flags on and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">But Maddenowsky (ph) when he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , every second <span class="BUILDING">house</span> were hanging a Swedish flag, and people going around with Swedish passports. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">So apparently he became first very, very frustrated and annoyed about all this and so on, and he said the Swedes must be very suspicious people and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">So he never communicated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Turbuchon</span> (ph) and say, "Look, here, if you see any Swedes there, take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">Arrest them." </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">Because -- and at our side there were no signs that we have done anything but being a <span class="BUILDING">Swedish Embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">I think that explains perhaps why they didn't bring us, take us to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">They arrested us, they interred us, and they had us under a guard for a couple of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">But then they decided to send us <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> contrary to what happened to Raoul.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1284">QUESTION:  And the response of the Swedish government in trying to get Raoul back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1285">ANSWER:  Ya. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">Then, of course, they lost so much time when they thought the whole time that Raoul was under their protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">And this is also an interesting story how coded documents which have not been found, you know, tells the story how he was arrested -- no, first of all, how the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> according to instructions which all <span class="BUILDING">foreign offices</span> in the world were following; namely, the Swedish government had before the war, before this happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , given a list to the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> with all our names. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">And saying if you meet these people, take them under your protection because they are Swedes, Swedish diplomats. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">So immediately when the Soviet army found Raoul Wallenberg, according to the instructions they reported back to the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">And so they called for the Swedish Ambassador and they ticked off Raoul Wallenberg, he's safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">He is? </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">Oh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">And then they were happy, but they had not heard a word about us, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">So in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> they started to wonder and asked, "What has happened to the others?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">They thought one day Raoul Wallenberg would come back, but the others? </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">Not till we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> then in April they understood that now something must have been happening here to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Raoul</span> , and they started to ask and so on and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">Then it's interesting to ask the question how on earth could they report they had found Raoul Wallenberg and tell him that he's under good care and all that and the same time arrest him? </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">And that is the lack of communication then between the <span class="BUILDING">Soviet Foreign Office</span> and the KGB. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">Where the KGB had decided to arrest him, but they hadn't told the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">And they became furious, of course, when they heard that the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> had already told the Swedes that they had found Raoul Wallenberg because the following day, they arrested him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">We got the message on the 16th of January, and they arrested him on the 17th.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1302">QUESTION:  Did you think that the government of <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> did enough to try and get Raoul Wallenberg back?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1303">ANSWER:  Not the first -- I would say, as I say in my book, the first two years are the lost years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Well, of course, they should have acted in much forceful way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">They could have -- I mean, they had, after all, got the message that he was there, that they had found him, and they should have pushed that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">And they should have demonstrated that, should have used much harder language and so on, but they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">They didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">And that is very, very sad story, and that 1s also part of foreign policy and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">The Soviets had won the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">They were now going to dominate the whole <span class="REGION">Baltic Sea</span> , and we had come closer to them as neighbors than before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And one should not do anything to irritate them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1312">QUESTION:  Makes you angry, yes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1313">ANSWER:  Pardon?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1314">QUESTION:  Makes you angry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1315">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">To say the least.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1317">QUESTION:  Is there anything you would like to say about that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1318">ANSWER:  I think we have talked now for a while, and I'm thinking of the speech I'm going to make tomorrow, so I will try to say my words.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1319">QUESTION:  Well, then, let me thank you for being here today and for what you did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1320">ANSWER:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1321">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">Conclusion of interview. </span>
