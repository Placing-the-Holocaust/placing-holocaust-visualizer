ANSWER:  Yeah, we were an organized Jewish community, of which I was the secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And we started getting telegrams. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">First a telegram with a few names in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">They were German Jews-- or maybe Austrian Jews, I'm not sure--that were at that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , and they got the visas to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Some of them went to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , or somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">All they needed was Japanese transit visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">Can we arrange Japanese transit visas? </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Uh, our president of our Jewish community--Anatole Ponve’--was a very fine, hard-working dedicated person. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Uh he ran to the police and he talked to them about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">He says, "Look, there are six people. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Here are there names.” </span><span class="sentence" id="466">They gave their names on the...on the telegram. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And, uh, they said, "Well, what do you want?" </span><span class="sentence" id="468">He said, "Let them come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">We guarantee, we the Jewish community, will guarantee their stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">If they need money, and the political--uh that they are not spies, or anything of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Just allow them to enter through <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kobe</span> , and from here they will take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="472">At that time there was...it was before Pearl Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I'm talking about 1900... end of 1940, beginning of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And, uh, they said, "OK.” </span><span class="sentence" id="475">So we sent them a telegram that the visas can be obtained at the <span class="BUILDING">Japanese consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">They got it. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">But then the new story started, this Japanese consul in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> --in...in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaunas</span> [NB: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> ], <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> --who, as it was so very well written in this book, The Fugu Plan... Uh, one of the rabbinical students was a uh a uh citizen of <span class="COUNTRY">Netherlands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">He was a Dutch citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">y Originally: Anatole A.

"</span><span class="sentence" id="489">Yeah.” </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So he went back to the Russian authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I think that's how it worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And says, "Look, I don't need any visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I can go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="494">He says, "Show it. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Prove it to us.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="496">He went back to the Dutch consul; and the Dutch consul [he] told, "Look, give me a paper saying that according to the regulations there is no need for visas to enter <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curacao</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Surinam</span> in <span class="REGION">Dutch West Indies</span> , and subject to the permission from the Governor, the Dutch Governor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Curacao</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And he gave him that, he wrote it down with a stamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">That was all he needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">He went there and said, "Here. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I can go. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Here is the stamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Here is the proof that there is no need for a visa.” </span><span class="sentence" id="503">He says, "Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">We will give you the exit visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">How are you going to go?" </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Need a Japanese transit visa to travel across <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , and from <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So he went to the Japanese, and that's how it all started. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">The Japanese consul started to give them visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">They were standing there... You know, news spread very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">They started going, they were standing there day and night for their turn to get those visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">First the Dutch stamp, then the...the...the uh...the Japanese visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And this man Sugihara, the Japanese consul, he got instructions from his people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> , "Stop issuing visas.” </span><span class="sentence" id="513">But he didn't listen to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">He actually saved the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I mean, part of the whole picture, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">He was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Why did he do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I met him after the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">He uh...he said, "I don't think they can leave this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So let them have some peace of mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I'll give them the visas.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Now with the Dutch consul, according to this book that I just brought to show it to you--the one written by the Rabbi’--the Dutch consul had a...a secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">A German man, who eventually joined the German uh SA. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">The...the... You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">He...his job was to give to the consul the background of each uh...each person who applied for a Dutch, for that Dutch stamp, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And uh uh he was a German; but he was very sympathetic to the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And the reason is, according to this book, is he had a Jewish girlfriend when he was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="528">Laughter) Another one, another angle. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">It's amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">QUESTION:  Bring us back to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">ANSWER:  Bring it back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">So we were, we were the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">We were a small Jewish community, and we started working. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">We organized our ladies. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">My late wife was among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Uh, hundreds of people started to come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Where do you put them? </span><span class="sentence" id="538">You need <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">You need food. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">A representative of the Joint Distribution [Committee] sent their people to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kobe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">A representative of the Jewish organization HIAS sent their people. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">From <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> ; and they were helping with money. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">At first, we put up our own money when a few people came. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So there was very little to spend. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">You * Tokayer, Marvin (Rabbi), The Fugu Plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">know, transportation and food. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">But then, when hundreds started to come in, we just couldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So I sent a cable to the Joint Distribution Committee in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> saying uh what we are doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So in the reply came--I'll never forget it as along as I live--"Money no object. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Save Jews.” </span><span class="sentence" id="551">They immediately sent $25,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">That was a lot of money in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And...and since then, the representative of Joint came; and they were put uh...you know, more and more people were coming 1n.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  How did you arrange all...

<p><span class="sentence" id="557">ANSWER:  They were getting Japanese visas, transit visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">They had Russian exit visas, which the Russians gave to them; and they sold them, they allowed them to buy tickets only if they were paying. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">At first, they allowed them to use Russian money. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Then they said you have to pay in dollars; so all the Jews had relatives somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and also especially the religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">They...they organized themselves in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> with an organization called Va'ad Ha-Hatsala, "Organization of Saving," to...to...

It has to do with what uh Rabbi Tokayer has made research in this book: they...they...they thought by helping the Jews, they would influence the uh top of people in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> --President Roosevelt, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">They needed help.</span></p>

He says, "Well, if you were British, the British would have sent a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> after you and would have taken you out from here to one of the <span class="REGION">British colonies</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="986">At that time it was <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="987">It was <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="988">It was <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="989">They were all <span class="REGION">British colonies</span> , at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">He says, "That's the whole point. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">We must insist that they should send a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> after us. </span><span class="sentence" id="992"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And take us out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">We are their allies.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="995">So...so what do you want from me?"

What's that <span class="DLF">French port</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">Do you remember they were bombed out, like very, very severely?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1001">QUESTION:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">I don't quite remember but I know what you mean.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1003">ANSWER:  Uh, I said, "I don't think... Even if they wanted to do it, they have no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Now is war.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">He says, "Never mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">You go with me and you will translate.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">So, next day I called up the British Consul. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I...I...1 met him a couple of times, because of this situation with the young fellows who volunteered for the British army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And, uh, I said, "Look, I am going to bring a rabbi who is - I don't know if you ever saw uh these people who are still are in the 17th, 18th century, with the way they are dressed, the way they are wearing with the beards and with the fur hats.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">It's August. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">It was hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">I said, uh, "I...I'd like you to meet him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">He says, "Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">What time will he come? </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">Just call me, and I will...I will escort him myself.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">So I called him before, he came to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">We took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">We went there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I called him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">I called the Consul. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">He came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">The <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> was on the <span class="INT_SPACE">sixth floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">He came down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">He met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">Was very very... You know, we always thought the British were so uh high-falutin'--a consul and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">We went upstairs. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">What can I do for you, Rabbi?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">So I told him, the rabbi, "He wants to know what's the purpose of your visit.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">Well, he repeated the whole story about being allies with with the British and a Polish citizen, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">So the guy was smoking his pipe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">He said, "Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">That's a very reasonable request. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">I will have to transmit it to the to His Majesty's Ambassador.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">At that time, it was King George the VI in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ; in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> , his [Ambassador's] name was Robert [Granger (ph)], I believe.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1042">ANSWER:  Oh, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">It was 1941, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">By the way, I have to tell you a point, very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">Uh so when we were talking to the rabbi the night before, I said, "Rabbi, supposing it's all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Supposing it works. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">Who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">Where would you want to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">There's so many <span class="REGION">British colonies</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">He says to me, "Jamaica.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">I said, "Rabbi...” Frankly, I didn't even know where <span class="COUNTRY">Jamaica</span> was, at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">I heard the name <span class="COUNTRY">Jamaica</span> , but I couldn't imagine in my mind on the map where it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">He says, "For us, <span class="COUNTRY">Jamaica</span> .” "</span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Why not <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Why not <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">He says, "The climate is a good the climate, a very good climate.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">I took...I had an atlas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">I said [to myself], "<span class="COUNTRY">Jamaica</span> is very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And he thought if they'll get to <span class="COUNTRY">Jamaica</span> , it maybe would be easier for them to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">He didn't want to say that, but I think that's what he had it in mind. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1063">Laughter) Anyhow...
QUESTION:  Show us your photographs, would you please? </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">You brought photographs with you and there's one that has particular, two that have particular...
ANSWER:  [...I... In my mind, this particular photograph is very very ...uh I'd like to call it historical because the whole episode is historical. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Historical . . . (</span><span class="sentence" id="1066">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) like our like our Jewish people are concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">See, this 1s a farewell dinner for Mr. Ponve-- who is leaving for uh...who 1s leaving for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And uh...
QUESTION:  Mr. Ponve is who?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1069">ANSWER:  Ponve, he was the president of our community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">Mr. Ponve. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">P-O-N-V-E. Anatole Ponve. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">He lived here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">He passed away a few years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">Uh, the Japanese people that are sitting around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and some of them are standing are representatives of various Japanese government institutions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">One was the governor of the state where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">The uh Prefecture - they call it "Prefecture" - where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kobe</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">The others were all working for the Japanese police, but some of them... This gentlemen here was representative of Japanese government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">Anyway to make a long story short, he told Mr. Ponve, "You are going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">We want you to tell the American Jews over there, who are your brothers, how good the Japanese government is to your people here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">How we actually helped to save their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">How we allowed them to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">We gave them visas to come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And we want Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to know about this, and you tell them about us.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">That, in my mind, was the the the basic thought of the Japanese--that the the people in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , the Jewish, our people in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> are very very influential. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And they can influence the higher people in the government, and even the President Roosevelt himself, to help them with uh with uh arranging matters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">So that uh uh they will help them to settle the war in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">The Japanese were getting deeper and deeper towards <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> , and they had no way of getting out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">And uh <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> has uh has uh prohibited the sale of metals and oil to them, started to put economic sanctions on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And they were having a much much harder time at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">So I feel that's the...that's the historical angle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">What they were aiming at. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">It didn't work, because uh the Japanese were allies with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they were occupying <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> ; and the...the sentiment over here was...
QUESTION:  Show us some of your other photographs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1093">ANSWER:  Now this is the...this is the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">This is the group of people that were working. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1095">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) These are various activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">The refugees used to come for their mail, and they used to come with their problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And people would take care of them and uh we would try to solve all their problems whatever they were. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1098">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION) Uh, our ladies, our wives were also uh helping in uh in all the matters that were needed for the refugees; with their clothes and their food and their medical problems and their housing and uh living conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And so the ladies got together and organized a committee, our ladies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">My wife is one of the ladies there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1109">ANSWER:  Oh, the rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">This one here.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1115">QUESTION:  That's the rabbi.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1116">ANSWER:  And this was one of those rabbis--these two of them, as a matter of fact--came to see me about the matzahs, about getting the matzahs and wine through the customs and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">This is one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">They were very active. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">These are the Japanese gentlemen--Dr. Kotsuji, and Captain Fukamachi--who were very very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">They...they did a lot of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Uh as a matter of fact, Kotsuji spoke Hebrew and he converted to Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">He was, yes, very very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">Did a lot of work for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And uh he was buried in uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">He was very very helpful.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1127">QUESTION:  Tell us what happened after Pearl Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">What difference did it make in the way the community functioned?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">ANSWER:  Uh, well, as far as the refugees are concerned, in August, I believe--this was four months before Pearl Harbor--all of a sudden Japanese military took over all the affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">Until that time, their affairs, their arrangements, their visas, the extensions of the visas, the permits to stay, were handled by the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">By the prefecture of police in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kobe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And then in August, after the Japanese occupied in to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> , I believe, the things changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">The military came over and they took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And...and they came to us, and they said, "We give you uh two weeks," I think, "to get them all out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">All to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> .”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And then the immigration, the movement of the refugees to <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> , they gave <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> ; and by the hundreds they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">A few were still left, about six, you know, were left a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">But all eventually had to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And by the time Pearl Harbor...of Pearl Harbor, there were no more refugees left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> --in, uh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kobe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">They were all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">We stayed there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1142">QUESTION:  How did you stay, and what... Why did you stay, and what was it like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1143">ANSWER:  Well, I was...I had a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">I was working there, and uh business was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">I mean, I was buying merchandise and shipping. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">And uh when the war came uh, what do to? </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">I mean, I...my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I had my wife, my child. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And uh stayed there, and uh you couldn't do any more business. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Everything was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">The war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">My firm--which was a Panamanian firm-- a <span class="BUILDING">Panamanian consulate</span> was closed, because <span class="COUNTRY">Panama</span> declared war on <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">So I was left without a job, without any money, without anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">Without doing any business, I had to think of some way of continuing my livelihood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">So my family, my parents, were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> ; and uh I knew there were a lot of Jewish communities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">A lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Where they lived, they are making a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">I will do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">So...

"</span><span class="sentence" id="1167">As a friend.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">I said, "Well, why are you talking to people who like Japanese? </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">You know, [there are] some people who don't like the Japanese too much.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">He jumped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">He said, "What do you mean?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">I said, "Now, don't get excited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">Don't get sore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">You're talking like a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">You're not talking to me like a policeman now.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">I said, "Is it true?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">He said, "Yeah, it's true.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">I said, "Why?"
