ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Fanny Aizenberg on April 21“, 2011. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">And Fanny, first of all, I — like I do on every interview, I would like to thank you for giving our — your time today to speak with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">But unlike every interview that we do, where normally I ask — and I will be asking this later, I usually ask someone to start at the beginning, where were they born, what was their family like, who were their mother and father and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">All of these things are very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">But Id like to start ours in a little different way, because before we started the — the interview itself, we were talking about the process of it, and you were ac — you were telling me about some of the reservations that you had. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">So I’d like to talk about that a little bit, about what 1s it like to speak with someone about these experiences that we are going to be talking about today. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">If you could share some of those thoughts with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  For me it’s very difficult to talk publicly, because of many reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I have heard many wonderful speakers here at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , but all those people have been single people when the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I already had a child, and I already had responsibilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">April 21, 2011 And we — it started out scary enough, and my biggest problem also is, after so many years, I’m still living with the horrors I lived through in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  So, in other words, every time you talk, there’s a cost, there’s a cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Absu-absolutely right. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">Of course it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Even today, which is so many years later, when I’m in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and I pass where there’s a railroad, I still break out in a sweat, which 1s not the polit — polite way of saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Because we had been for so long in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> and I don’t think anybody has ever been able to find words what it was for three days and three nights, for 110 people, including babies, in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">The prayers, the screams, especially from babies, is just indescribable, at least I cannot find the words fer — to describe such unhuman things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  Do you think —
ANSWER:  And we didn’t know what was waiting for us at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Were there — were there many years when you didn’t speak about your life at all in — about this — these aspects of your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  Well, I’ve only start — what is it, Steven, 10 years? </span><span class="sentence" id="20">S: Ten years ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  Fanny is talking to Steven Vitto who is [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Yes, when he was always — and I was very lucky that my job was to sit with Steven, because of his kindness, of his generosity and caring. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Don’t forget, Steven, not because he’s a young person, we are from such a different background and we April 21, 2011 used to have conversations, like one human being should be fortunate to have with another one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  Tell me of — tell me a little bit about this, this 1s — you started as a volunteer here at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , 1s this what you’re talking about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  And how is it — and what was Steve’s job? </span><span class="sentence" id="26">What was his way of meeting you? </span><span class="sentence" id="27">What was — how did your interactions start?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Well, it really started that I saw in “The Jewish Week,” which is a small magazine —
QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  — advertised that the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> needs volunteers. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And one way or another, I was debating for a long, long time, and there’s a lot of things which I didn’t care for to come here. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And I have decided I want to come and see what it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And I am — was interview by somebody, which we connected very nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Her name is Jill and I don’t -- Coynburg(ph) or Cohenberg(ph), I don’t remember her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And somehow, we had a conversation that we understand each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">She said, look Fanny, you could start here right now, or you could wait for about two months when we have a orientation. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And I knew that if I would wait for an orientation, I would never come back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  You knew yourself well then — April 21, 2011
ANSWER:  So she say you could do — yes, I could change my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I had many reasons for not wanting to come, like I had many reasons to do come.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">QUESTION:  What were some of the reasons for not wanting to come?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">ANSWER:  There’s a lot of things I didn’t agree the way the things were working here. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So I had the choice and I did not wait to be oriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I felt I had been oriented a lot, through the time I was — the Germans occupied <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , that was enough orientation. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Anyway, I was very, very fortunate, I met Steven, and immediately we connected very nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">At the same time, I was translating a book from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , who just came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">This was a no — official book, how many transports they had from [indecipherable] how many people in each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , how many people made into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="46">What many people didn’t know, that many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> had gas and people were gassed in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> before they even got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  So as you were coming to — to work at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> as a volunteer, you were also translating this book at the same time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Yes, bes —
QUESTION:  I'd like to stop — excuse me inter — for interrupting you Fanny, I'd like to bring Steve into this shot a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Can we do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Is there a way for Steve to stand right here? </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Q2: Now, you want a two shot, I take it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  This looks like — this is two people in one shot? </span><span class="sentence" id="53">April 21, 2011 Q2: This is a two shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  That’s a two shot — Q2: Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  — yes, at this — while Steve is in the frame, then yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Q2: Keep it on the two shot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  Yeah, keep it on the two shot, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Q2: Okay, that sounds good. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">All-righty-roo.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  We’re ready? </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Q2: We’re all set now, uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Id like to introduce Steve Vitto to our conversation, Fanny, and I’d like Steve to explain a little bit about what his job was here, and how it is that the two of you met and interacted. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So Steve, tell me a little bit about what you do, and how it is that your — your <span class="DLF">path</span> with Fanny’s crossed. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">S: I work in a department that was then called the Holocaust S-Survivors Registry. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We’ ve since expanded, now we’re called the Holocaust Survivors and Victims Resource Center. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And my job then and my job now 1s to ensure that the individual experiences of Holocaust survivors are first recorded in our survivors registry and then made available to people who are asking about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So I bridge the gap between researching archives, but always interacting with the public in s — to find April 21, 2011 out what happened to an individual and to help ensure that an individual’s experience in the Holocaust is recorded in some way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  By recorded, do you mean put in a database, or do you mean that like we’re doing an interview with Fanny right now? </span><span class="sentence" id="70">S: It runs the gamut, the primary focus then was the survivors registry, which 1s survivors or their families providing that information to us, since most people who went through the Holocaust did not have documentation of that experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So, to fill in that gap, we want people to come to us and provide that information that’s otherwise not available, and then we put that information into a database that can then be accessed by people coming through the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , or calling us or writing me for that information. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">That’s one particular database and since then we also work with many other databases, including oral history collections, more online databases, digitized and also scanned image databases.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  So tell me about how it is that Fanny and you first met. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">S: Well, we work in a registry, we work with su-survivor volunteers who come to us and they’re very important, not only in giving us their testimony, but in helping us to arrange, put in data, to scan images and to help us 1n a variety of ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And so Fanny came to me as a volunteer from — she had mentioned our volunteer coordinator, Jill Weinberg, and Fanny was able to do several — working with computers, she was able to pick up using our survivors registry. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And we often get April 21, 2011 requests not only for individual information, but information based on <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So for instance, all the people who were from — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> for instance, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , or from a particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , or share a ca — particular experience, and with our database, we’re able to push a few buttons and so we can get not only a list of individuals, but individuals from a particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And I had a particular request for people who were — somebody wanted information from those who were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , who were registered with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And Fanny was able to help me to —I could set her up and so she could look through this list and produce it so that I could filter it a little bit and provide that information to another individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">That was one database. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">The other infor — information — the other job she had was, since Fanny speaks Belgian, we have a book that’s a list of the deportations that took place in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And this particular collection is based on date, date of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> only. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And also, it was producing. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">It was Belgian, so it was in Belgian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I think in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> we have French and Flemish, as — as languages, SO — S: Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  So which language was it, of those two? </span><span class="sentence" id="88">S: This is in French, okay, you’re right, you’re right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  It was in French, okay, sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">April 21, 2011 S: But because of Fanny’s background in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , I thought it would be a good fit, and this — this information was in French, and Fanny looked through that. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And before each — it’s divided by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoys</span> , before each name list of those on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoys</span> is a description of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoy</span> , and — in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And Fanny was able to translate those introductions, so that now people could not only look up the names of those who were on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , but they could also read, in English now, that general description of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  But cle — thank you, Steve, because I — I — I think we needed to get a sense of what was the structure of the volunteer program, but clearly something much more happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">This was the specific job, the specific task, but when you met, something much more happened between you. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And Fanny, can you tell me what it is that you f — that you felt and that was an ongoing thing over the past several years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">ANSWER:  Because mainly, little by little, I was telling Steven my background and my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And he was kind, very tolerant, and listening. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Also, when we got the book from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , further descriptions, the number of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , the number of people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and how many transport, at the same time the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> got a book called “The Hidden Heroes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="99">That book was written by a German reporter. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">She is from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">She tried to interview peop — Jewish people in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and nobody wanted to give her any information. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Somehow, she was so determined, she came to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and she got the real information, with the names of the people from the April 21, 2011 underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">The underground, the resistance, they were also called the solidarity, and they have pictures right here from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So that book, and the one I was translating made more sense because you could put the two and two together. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And that book wasn’t selling too well, and they had — she had to change the title, to “The 20 Transport.” </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And what makes it so interesting, that in the book, in that what made in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> more people survive, because the underground, Jewish people, non-Jewish people, any kind of people were just one group. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Where in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> they had a separate group of French people, a separate group of Jewish people, and the same thing has happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And this is why in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> only, because of such a dedication of so many unbelievable, brave, wonderful people, I can’t even find the names, who organized in <span class="BUILDING">convents</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> and regular people, because of their caring and their dedication, 40,000 Jewish people have survived in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , including my own child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  That’s amazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  So you see that combination, it was so wonderful that Steven was there for me to help [indecipherable].</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  So wou —
ANSWER:  And many of the words from the documents from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , I did not know because I didn’t learn English of those documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So Steven would — made sure I have a special dictionary, to have those [indecipherable] what anybody who wanted April 21, 2011 to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Another thing what we did is anybody passing by on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> , you just seen people running back and forth, specially young students. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So we really — my job really was, can we help you? </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And we did, because once we had a French person who was sent from a newspaper in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , with the picture from the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where you have all the pictures there, and whoever he asked, they didn't know what he wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And he passed a few times, til I had enough guts and I asked if I help you? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Then he said in French, nobody knows the answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And he had a copy of the picture and the name of the newspaper he was representing. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">So immediately if not sooner, Steven was able, through the computer, to get the — all the information, which he typed for him to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So he didn’t have to go to so many <span class="NPIP">places</span> , because he was originally in the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So you see, you never know the contact you have with Steven in that particular <span class="NPIP">place</span> , because he knows the answers to everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Well, 1t — to me it sounds that here when you started volunteering — I don’t want to put words in your mouth, but this is the sort of thoughts that are coming into my mind, is that there were aspects of the larger story that was relevant to you because it had to do with the Belgian underground.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  You’re right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">QUESTION:  That you were finding out through this work, and that through the work and through your interaction, little bit your own story was coming up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">ANSWER:  Exactly, you’re right. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">April 21, 2011
QUESTION:  And 1s — and 1s that what made it more comfortable for you to now speak?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  Oh, more than just comfortable, because I had the hard time when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I was still young, nobody from the family wanted to hear any of our stories, because they were afraid they gonna have a headache.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  That must have been —
ANSWER:  So this was somebody I just got to know, and I felt comfortable — there’s another word which is just more than comfortable, at ease, and we could talk, which is so unbelievable, which I haven’t done to such extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Because this was always bottle up and still is, to many extent. [</span><span class="sentence" id="130">indecipherable] was very, very fortunate, and the same thing, thanks to Steven. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">He made sure that I would be speaking up. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">He said, if you don’t do it now, when you gonna do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And I know I’m old, so I had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">But it just amazing how two people from such different backgrounds, different lives, have been able to have such a wonderful relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  Steve?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  Which is gonna be for me forever, because we could talk about so many things and I’m very fortunate to have a young person who could understand our situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So that’s why I say —
QUESTION:  Steve, we’re putting you on the spot all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  No, ’'m not. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">He knows I’m not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">April 21, 2011
ANSWER:  So ever — so I—1f I ever get a gold star, it belongs to Steven.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  Steve, is there something you want to add to this, of your thoughts in the years as they’ve gone by, what you’ve learned from Fanny and through the relationship that developed between you about her story? </span><span class="sentence" id="143">S: Oh my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Well, the first thing I wanted to say 1s I br — I wanted to push Fanny, because we did develop this personal relationship and I’m very fortunate in my job that I’m able to interact with the survivors and their families individually, and I meet hundreds of them, thousands of them for 20 years now, but Fanny is os — really special. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And again, one of my profe — jobs is to ensure that the stories of individuals are remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And so, while we had great conversations, I didn’t want it to end there. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I wanted to make sure that other people were able to hear her story through oral histories, read her story. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I always get her — want her to write out her stories, do presentations as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And so in this way, it’s sort of my job, but to make sure that her story is heard by as many people as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">She has so many things to teach about — I guess mainly for me 1s overcoming. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Someone who’s been through so much, and by listening to her I understand as much as anybody can, what she went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And knowing her family, the main thing is about overcoming that. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">You go through so many things and sometimes there’s no answer to them, you just have to wait things out until they pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And you’re affected for life, but that horrible moment does pass and you have to rebuild your life afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And Fanny was April 21, 2011 able to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">So I knew her story, but I also met her daughter and I got to know her granddaughter and her great-granddaughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And so I see that for the horrible things that Fanny went through, four generations later, there’s a beautiful 12 year old girl that’s a friend of my son’s actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And I see that if it wasn’t for Fanny just persevering and going on, that’s — if it wasn’t for that, this beautiful 12 year old girl would not be there, would not be friends with my sons, and would not have the freedom to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and enjoy life in a way that Fanny wasn’t able to later on in her life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And we’re going to continue now with let’s say, the usual part of our oral history. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">But I thought it was very important —
ANSWER:  I think so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  — that we — that we would be able to —
ANSWER:  Because — [Il you why I feel it’s so important. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">It’s very difficult in this time and age, with technology that’s so advanced, to such extent you have little ones with the — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span> , the cell phone, just name it and it’s growing bigger and bigger, that people still could have a personal relationship, and feel good about themself, that they have somebody else who could understand their feelings or what they’re saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Another problem I had is because of the things I went through, I always felt —and this is still with me today, because it took me 50 years to be able to talk about April 21, 2011 it, and I still have a feeling of inferiority, that I’m not like other people, which I’m not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Because you suffered? </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Because you went through these things?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1120">QUESTION:  I see, so —
ANSWER:  Because I could never imagine if that’s a possibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Somehow I felt those people would be protected, and I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">So once my father was taken away in °42, I really had absolutely no choice, but I still couldn’t make up a decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">April 21, 2011
