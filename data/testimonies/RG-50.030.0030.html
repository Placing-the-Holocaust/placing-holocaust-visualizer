<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">We're now about to start. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Would you tell me your name, please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  My name is Magda Blau. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I was born Hellinger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  Where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  I was born on the 19th of August 1916 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Michalovce</span> , Slovens...<span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Will you tell me about your parents and your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  My parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My husb...my father was a teacher of Jewish history. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My mother was a very nice woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">He was...she was a real Jewish mother, who worked and cooked and baked and had a <span class="DLF">garden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">So we had all the fruit and vegetable. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And she helped all the poor, where they needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So I saw already at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> what it means to be helpful to others. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">That's how I was brought up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Tell me about your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">You had brothers at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Yes, we had brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">But I haven't a...didn't have so much contact with my brothers; because there, in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , little children went to learn Jewish history early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Then we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And then, as a only daughter between the four boys, it was somehow different. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I had my...my group of children; but sometimes we played, boys and girls, together. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">But mostly I had my own crowd of...either at, at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> or after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  Tell me about your childhood and growing up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">ANSWER:  My childhood was a very nice childhood, because my father was um--like I told you that-- Jewish history teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And every night, I couldn't get asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">You know, like you tell stories for children? </span><span class="sentence" id="28">He told me always the stories about the history, because he was studying in Frankfurt-am-Main; and he knew and visited all the <span class="NPIP">places</span> that the Jewish history was around. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And so he told me the travels and all the stories what happened; and that was very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And so, before I go to sleep, I crawled in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and he told me those stories; and then I fell to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And they had to carry me out from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And um as a matter of fact...because this time wasn't a <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> when I was a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So I always went with my father to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ; and I was listening to the stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And the children, you know, they was spoiling me rotten. (</span><span class="sentence" id="35">Laughter) And um when I grew tired, so my father asked one of the children to take me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Because I was just a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I was a very bad eater. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I was very skinny; but I already, as a young child, always worried about the poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my mother, and I said, "You know, Mom, I saw...I been at my neighbor's pla...our neighbor's place. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And they are so poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">They haven't got anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And it's Shabbat coming, and they haven't got meat and fat and sugar and coffee and tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So I am not going to eat, but please give them." </span><span class="sentence" id="44">My mother said to my father, "We have so much trouble for her to put a spoon of food in her mouth, (laughter) and she says she's not going to eat!" </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So I managed that this way, already as a young child, that we went to the families. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I was talking with the lady of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> while my mother put it in the pots the food; because they was very proud to accept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And that was the start of my childhood, and that's how I grew up helping people and helping the neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And I always said I will be a doctor, because this is also helping the chil...the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And later in my life, um there came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> some Hebrew teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And they came to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we girls was playing. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And he introduced us a Hebrew songs and dances. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And that's what happened, that they put us first in this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">That in...we just played around in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where one of the children lived; but later he transferred us--like Jewish scouts--in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> which they called [Ma'adon (ph)], which means [louder (ph)]. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And there I started to get to know with the history and what they want to try to make: that they should be in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish state</span> , we should have a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And so it started my youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And I was very much involved; and...because if they...1n a certain organization, they found out somebody's willing and able, naturally they use. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And I didn't mind it. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I was sent out to start a new organization of Jewish scouts. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And as a young girl, I had the idea that's the only way how you can start an organization, gather them under a flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So I was very capable. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I must say, today I don't even know how I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But I approach the all the right sources. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I approached the teacher who was a sewing teacher, and I asked her if she would sew the emblem of, the scout's emblem, on the flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I approached a man who was selling material if he would donate that for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Which he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Then I had the idea that, you know, to have golden nails with their names, which they donate. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And...and the man who did it, he was doing it for...like for charity; but the one who had the nail written in the pole, he had to pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So...and also I arranged a very nice evening with children--dancing and songs and a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And so a lot of money came together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  And this was all for the Zionist Organization?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  Yeah, all for the Keren Kayemeth [and Keren] Hayesod.' </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I tell myself I been very smart, because the collection of the money--I started with the generals. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">There was three military generals. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And I approached the one with the list if he was willing to support the nail of...the golden nail; and voluntarily how much he was willing to give. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And every general was very generous. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Then I approach the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">But on the top of the list was a huge amount, so nobody was... You know how it goes. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And so things like that, I did already. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">They always send me to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> to organize a evening like for Keren Kayemeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So I did all those things before I started; and I postponed my finishing my ' Keren Kayemeth [L'Yisrael], known in English as the Jewish National Fund, and Keren Hayesod (English name unknown) were established by the Zionist Organization in 1901 for the purpose of purchasing land in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> for Jewish settlement. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">studying as a kindergarten teacher, because I thought it's very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Somebody should do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And then I finished there; because, in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , wasn't able...I wasn't able to study for kindergarten teacher because there wasn't <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So I did it privately, by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I went practicing to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , where it was a <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And then I did my...finished my study by myself, and I did the exams in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="88">This was the special <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And so I became a kindergarten teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But even as a young girl, during the holiday... I really don't know how, how...where did I get all those ideas? </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I said to my--I had a girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I said, "Look at the children running around, and there is not a <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">At least during the holiday, let's open a <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And I approached there, there was a...we called her "Gleich Mamma."” </span><span class="sentence" id="95">That was her name; and she was in everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And we said, "What would you say...the children is running around the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and if we would open a <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="97">She said, "I am totally behind you children. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I arrange everything." </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Because when she went, two o'clock from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> she went... You know, her social life was...She went through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , everywhere she had somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">She talked with somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">If we ask her husband, "Where is Gleich Mamma?" </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And he said, "Wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Now it's six o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Two o'clock, she was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Three o'clock, she was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Three o'clock...now, it's six o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">She will be in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> there and there." (</span><span class="sentence" id="109">Laughter) He knew exactly her timetable. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And she arranged everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So during the school holiday, we gathered forty children. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And there was a man who wanted to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And he had built a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but he married in two months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So she arranged he should let the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And <span class="DLF">sand pits</span> , and somebody made us the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And we two young children... was, I has then my birthday in August, and the school holiday in our <span class="NPIP">place</span> is June and July, August. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So I was doing it before I was even fifteen.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  As you got older, obviously things began to change. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Um...what happened um...as indeed things changed, and the war drew closer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  When the real war came closer, I still...1 had my <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">It's true that all the doctors and the lawyers, they were stripped from their um possibility to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Because it's already started the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And um...but I didn't have even to wear a...a yellow star; because my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> belonged, the <span class="BUILDING">Kinderheim</span> [NB: <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> ] belonged to the inspectorate of the other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So I, I...well, they didn't...they wasn't so strict on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So I didn't feel much in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of the persecution, so far as that they lost all their jobs--the lawyers and everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And they started to take away the businesses, and they put Arierstaters (ph)] in. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">That means somebody had their eye on that job, and he was member of that...was a Hlinka guard--similar like SS, or something--and so they took away the business from the Jewish men. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And in *"Gleich" means equal or equivalent. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Perhaps she was given this name because she was like a mother to everyone? “</span><span class="sentence" id="130">Mamma Gleich” may also refer to Margit Gleich, who was active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Michalovce community</span> and a patron of the Zionist youth movements (she is mentioned in the Michalovce memorial book, published in 1969). * </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Since she was born in 1916, this would have been 1931. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">came, without any um restitution or something for the...for the Jewish man, and he [NB: the Jew] had to go out and he [NB: the Aryan] came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So that was bad for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And um...and for me, it was... I don't know if we have time for it, but there was a shoemaker who lived in our vicinity, what he had a <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> on the way where I went to the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And I made all my shoes there. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">He made me beautiful boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And, really, top job. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But what I didn't know, that he fell in love with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">A father with a few children who lived in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And um every time I went to the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , he came out from the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> and he said, "How are you" and "Good morning." </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And I thought it's just neighborly. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">One day, he came to the <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> ; and he said, "I want to protect you. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">In this way: that I will make one child, whichever child that is, is your child. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Because first now they are taking the young girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And as you have a child, I can make that you are exempted from this um transport." </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And I said, "But why are you doing it? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I haven't gotten a child." "</span><span class="sentence" id="148">Can't you understand?" </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I said, "No." "</span><span class="sentence" id="150">I am in love with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I want to protect you." </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I said, "And later, when the children will have to go?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="153">Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I will protect you always." </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And I said, "You mean, I should be your mistress?" </span><span class="sentence" id="156">He said, "Do I have to make it clear for you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So...because I, I couldn't believe my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">But that's what he wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Naturally, I didn't want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I told my mother; I said, "Isn't that funny? </span><span class="sentence" id="161">He's our neighbor, and he's my bootmaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And he gives me such proposition!" </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So I... "What did you say?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="164">I said, 'Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">You are really very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">You mean it well. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">But,' I said, 'T couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">You have a wife and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">How could you ask for me that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="170">The same night, they came for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">The same night they came for me; because he was so angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Because he was waiting that I will naturally say yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">But I didn't know...um, I wouldn't even... I can't believe even when I would know where I am going I would agree to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">But this time, they said to us...which they deceived us, and there was nobody to say something differently. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">They said we are going to work in the <span class="BUILDING">Bata factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So I said to myself, "What's so wrong to go to <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So we will go to <span class="BUILDING">Bata factory</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="178">That's what I thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Nobody ever said that there is danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And then it came that um they gather us, they gathered us like at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">But me, I was so sure that they will...I will be excepted...exempted as a kindergarten teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So I wasn't worrying about myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I worried about others; especially, there was fathers whose daughter was hiding somewhere and they took the fathers instead. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So I worried about the old fathers; and um run around and gave them help. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And I did get excepted um papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">But what happened, there is always somebody greedy. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">They knew I have the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And one woman, a teacher, she bought my papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">She paid twenty thousand crowns, Czech crowns,” for the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And when my father...
QUESTION:  To whom?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">ANSWER:  In the inspectorate was a...a man who was doing the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">She paid him twenty thousand; so she got my papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And my father found out and he went to the <span class="BUILDING">inspectorate</span> ...because he was also in...like teacher, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">So they say, "My dear man," he says, "the times are changing. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">If you bring me twenty thousand crowns, I take it away from her, even if she paid * Czech: koruna. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Official currency of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">it already. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And I give it back to your daughter." </span><span class="sentence" id="199">But my father didn't have the twenty thousand crowns. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">He was crying like a baby, saying it to somebody who after the war told me... He was crying, "They tear the nicest flower out of my <span class="DLF">garden</span> , but I can't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I haven't got the money." </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Anyway, when we came on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...so from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , we went on normal <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And we came there, and the girls was dressed like peasants woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">You know, because they lived in little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And I had my beautiful wardrobe. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">So I opened my suitcase and I dressed them all up. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And there was a policeman--what they called them gendarme, a gendarmerie, because they was Czech. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">They... they had the quarters in the same <span class="DLF">street</span> that we lived on the corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">So they saw me passing by, and they was always very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And he thought...said, "I never happened to see something, that somebody should give away all the clothes!" </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I had only what I had on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">The dress, the coat and a muff, and a bag. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">All the rest I gave out. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I dressed up all the girls, because... He said, "Why are you doing that?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="215">Because," I said, "we are going to <span class="BUILDING">Bata factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">I want the girls to be representing nice."

<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  That...that German woman who was in charge of our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , which she was from politisch reason there. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So she knew about it, so she pulled me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And she said, "You are going to work <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and help me and scrub the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I says, "With what? </span><span class="sentence" id="484">You haven't got anything." </span><span class="sentence" id="485">She said, "With your nails. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">But here you will stay." </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So I...1 took water and I scrubbed the wat...the dirt with my nails. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">But I thought, "I am crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I'm going rather <span class="NPIP">outside</span> on the fresh air." </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Next day, the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I did it three times. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">The third time she said, "What you think you are going to? </span><span class="sentence" id="493">You are going to work for the <span class="DLF">fields</span> to prepare yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="494">How long will you last? </span><span class="sentence" id="495">They will beat you there. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">They will, you know, run you there. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And you won't last three days there. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And I need you there; because look my feet! </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I need somebody who will help me." </span><span class="sentence" id="500">So, and she said, "Otherwise, tell me what you are from profession that you don't want to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , or....". </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I said, "I don't want to tell." </span><span class="sentence" id="502">She said, "Tell me." "</span><span class="sentence" id="503">I'm a kindergarten teacher." </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So she said, "I am a teacher, so I understand what you mean you don't want your profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">But come and help me." </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So let's go start my...my first career. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">She said, "Help me, because I am unable to do that." </span><span class="sentence" id="508">So I was going to carry the food, the bread, the evening meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And we always had to volun...ask for volunteers; because us was a small number and for six hundred people to bring bread and this, that was a hard task. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Because came tired from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">But we had to have the food, but straight away I used that that I am <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for something good; because you can do good even where is impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So I approached the girls who are um working in so-called "Revier"-- like <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I said, "Steal wherever you... whatever you could and bring it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to me, because I know what to use it for." </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And to those girls who are working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">sewing room</span> , "Bring all the rags what you can. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Steal it. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Put it in the pants and bring it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So they brought it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And when the girls came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I saw what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Now I understood why she didn't want to, because she...they had terrible experiences right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">So I bandaged them. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">So I gave them some medication what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And I was even, when I gave the food out, I didn't sit down to eat the food; because I was... saw so many I had to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And there was a interesting thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">There was a girl who was watching me doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And she said, "My name is [Bluma (ph)]." </span><span class="sentence" id="526">She lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="527">I am a daughter...and I am a daughter of a rabbi from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> ," where my husband was born. "</span><span class="sentence" id="528">And, you see, I think that God send me watch over you while you are helping others. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And now you are coming and you are sitting down, and you have that little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Otherwise you won't have strength to do what you are doing." </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And that's what she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Every night, she said, "Enough is enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Now you are going to sit down and have your meal." </span><span class="sentence" id="534">So that's where it started, that togetherness to help each other in the girls where the misery was. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And the sadisms of the woman who took the girls out in kommando, and often they did hurt unnecessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Like...you know, the demolition all the...or they didn't want that the civil population should know, being so close, and see <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="537">So they...they demolished some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and they transferred them somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">But there was ruins. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So they took some woman and watched that; they let some woman go down and some woman on top. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And they had them to demolish and throw the bricks down. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And down the girls was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And if they didn't want to, they beat them. "</span><span class="sentence" id="543">Throw that bricks down!" </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And they threw the bricks on their own friends; and often they came half dead, or dead already. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Or they carried rocks from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to the other. "</span><span class="sentence" id="546">Los! </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Los!" </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So this...this was the start. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And the girls became sick, and the girl became weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And some were...some run to the electrical um... We, we had an <span class="DLF">electrical fence</span> which was with um electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">So if you touch it, you been dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">But some girls, they said, "I rather that. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I can't take it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And I can't see any end to it." </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Because except that the work, there was other things that you wouldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">There was fleas, artificial-like breeded to that they should jump only on <span class="NPIP">places</span> like eyes, ears, nose and mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">You you couldn't help it. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">There was hundreds jumping on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Then there was lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Everywhere lice, crawling all over you. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And then was lice who was crawling under your skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And all that, plus the beatings and the starving and the brutality. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So a lot of girls choose another death. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">But we lasted there in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Auschwitz</span> about...I would say, beginning of August. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I can't tell you exact days that I come. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">And then because...you know, days and weeks we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">We didn't have that somebody says, "It's Monday" or "Tuesday" or... We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">The days were just passing without us knowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And so they took us um on walking to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="570">If <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> was thought on the biggest Satan what can exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">There was um <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> from clay, which meant before it was for horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And the <span class="NPIP">place</span> for one horse suddenly became a lodging for thirty woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Because they put two planks across, and some woman was lying down. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Ten down, ten in the middle, and ten on the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And they couldn't even move. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">They could just lie like sardines, covered up with one blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And this is not enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">But the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was with holes, because they supposed to bring canalization there. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">But they didn't wait 'til they have the canalization, or they have water or they have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">They brought us there in this stage. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">First of all, a lot of lice and this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And it was muddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And it was... You had that one... They... One thing, they took away the Russian uniforms and they gave us one dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">But nothing under it. '</span><span class="sentence" id="585">Nother scarf, and the same wooden clogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">And they...in that you had to exist in rain, in shine. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">So the rain...1magine what it does--the rain and the shine--what it is to a little rag. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">It's felling to pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And some girls was falling 1n that...in those <span class="DLF">holes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And if you fall in this <span class="DLF">hole</span> and you been weak, you couldn't walk out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">That was the end of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And except that it was, when it was raining it was muddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And it was muddy; and so the girls had the wooden clogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And when they walked in it and lost the clogs, they couldn't even take it out anymore; because it was "Los! </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Los!" </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So they run...so they run barefoot in the cold, in the rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">It was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And also, there was only one <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the water was. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">It was one <span class="DLF">well</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">When you took the water out in a...like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">basket</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="601">You had to wind it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">But imagine, one for so many thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And the people came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> thirsty. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So one over the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And lot of girls, they fell in and that was the finish. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And then you couldn't drink that water because it was like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And later they made like the water in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">But it was always a restriction of the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Soon you arrived there, they closed up the water. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">It was all sadistically, brutality. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">You know, just make us like really swines. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Because you couldn't wash yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">You couldn't go properly to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">There was just a <span class="DLF">hole</span> , and over the <span class="DLF">hole</span> a piece of plank. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And you was sitting on the plank and there was... So, and a lot of people, one push the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And if you fell in, that was the finish. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And things like that, for you to see and to...to...to be able to...to...to go on with the life, it's unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So...and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , like I said, people fell in those--"graven," you call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Like, you know, they dig ditches for the...the pipes what they wanted to put in. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But they wasn't in hurry to put in. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And often, they made...they call it "Blocksperre" [NB: "block closing"]. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">There was a siren and everybody had to run to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And say the girl was just on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">And she wanted to run, but there was that <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="626">They fell in. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And when the siren was over, and whoever was found in those <span class="DLF">ditches</span> , they took them straight away on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Often, I did that I saw some friend of mine...they, they just fell in. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">So I run out to pull them out and push them back to... Because I thought [to] myself, "Every day when you are alive, maybe...maybe there will be a chance that something will happen and prolong the life. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Maybe some miracle will happen and the war will come to the end, and then they will recuperate." </span><span class="sentence" id="631">By one of these such occasions when I did it, and the whistle came up and I was there with the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So, naturally, I also went on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with all others to be taken to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And, you know, fate... This woman who many months ago had experiences carrying the water with me and I didn't want to be her lesbian friend...but she was just having a Kommando taken out to work and she was the kapo of this kommando. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And she saw me on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and she knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So she came up and she gave me one big slap; and she pulled me down from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And to the SS who was guarding, he [NB: she] said, "I couldn't walk out with the Kommando because she is missing!" </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And she was, you know, pretending to scream at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And when I came and she said, "And now, run! </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Run for your life." </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And that's... and it saved me. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Anyway, and then...
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">At this point we're going to pause and change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">This is a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to change tapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="644">ANSWER:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">TAPE #2
QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">There was a story you wanted to tell.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  There is...there is a short story I want to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">When I was a young girl...and because being a only daughter, my father took me to a famous rabbi, who came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , to be blessed. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">When he blessed and put his hands over my head, he says "This girl has a special mission in her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">She is chosen, and she is going to save hundreds and hundreds of Jewish sisters and brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And that's what her life will be." </span><span class="sentence" id="652">My father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , told my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">They said, "What? </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Seven year old girl, what he is talking about?" </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Um, but naturally I didn't know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Only before I went away, so my mother told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Imagine, when you've been...the rabbi told that I don't know why he was telling it. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And um my sister said, "Probably that's what you are doing for Zionism. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">That's what it is." </span><span class="sentence" id="660">But when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , I felt something that's... Often I opened my mouth, and I say things and I do things, like...it's not me. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Like...I don't believe in...in...11 unnatural or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">But it was like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Because I undertook to save um my friends, and...and implanted in them to do that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">So I thought, "Is it me doing that, or is something in me what is doing it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="665">So I just show you one sample. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">You see, because the girls was wearing one dress and it was in rain or in shine, so they used the blanket what they have to cover up. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And they tore it up to put it around their chest or wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">So they took all the girls who been in charge to a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> they called <span class="INT_SPACE">sauna</span> , where they usually had once in a while um <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And they put a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And all the commanders of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> from all over were sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And they invited all... Invited! (</span><span class="sentence" id="672">Laughter) I am talking invited! </span><span class="sentence" id="673">All the...all the woman in charge there, even the charge--it wasn't that we wanted to be in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">They pressed us in the charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And they...they said, "You know what the women are doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="676">They are sabotage! </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And you...

I had anyway a nice writing as you saw; and now even I made it even nicer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">And I was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">But one day, I heard the news that the Hungarian arrivals are coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">And one day I was called up by the commander replacing the commander-in-charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">And he...she said, "You will be the Lageraltest in the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where the arrivals are coming." </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">So I said, "Oh, I am so happy here in, in where I am." </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">And she laughed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">She had teeth standing out like that, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">She said, "Oh, ho, ho, ho." </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">She said, "Oh, you are happy here, are you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">She said, "But you are taking that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">You will be in charge." </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">And I said, "I don't know how to be a Lager oldest." </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">I said, "I never been one." </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">And she laughed with her teeth, and she said, "Where could you be?

</span><span class="sentence" id="1451">So they took me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">And the Lagerkommandant, Kramer'!--which was a man of six foot six, with hands like that--he said, "Here you will be Lageraltest." </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">And I looked in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">There was empty <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , nothing in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">Not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , no straw sack, no blankets, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">And I said...clapped my feet and announced my number, and I said, "Lagerfthrer, please. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">Here you want me to be, that next day or the Thursday you can call all the woman 'Jewish swines." </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">Because they're...where can they... they will sleep on top of each other, and they probably won't be able to go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and they will make on each other!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">So I said, "Why don't you send them straight away to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">And I said...and he said, "Why you worrying so much about the other people? </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">Worry about yourself, that you take care of yourself!" </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">And I...but wonder of wonders... Now I tell you, I don't know who was talking from my mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">I said again, that ceremony...I said, "If you, in reverse, would be in charge and you will be a Lager oldest; and the prisoners '' SS Hauptsturmfiihrer Josef Kramer was Kommandant of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> from May 1944, when the Hungarian Jews began arriving, until December 1944, when he was transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">KL Bergen- Belsen</span> by Rudolf Hoss. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">would be your fellow Germans and you wouldn't help them, I would call you 'Coward." </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">And I said it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">I said, "My goodness! </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">Magda, are you crazy? </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">Whom you talking? </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">This is the commander who whenever somebody he doesn't even like or who is just in his way, he grabs it by his neck, squeezes it a minute, throws them like a doll. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">And he is killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">And you telling him what is?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">But I stood straight, and I said, "Be strong, and don't move from this <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">And he looked at me, and he saw I am not shaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">I am not crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">I am not begging. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">He says, "You know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">You are right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">Tomorrow you will have what you want." </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">So I said, "I want <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">I want straw sacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">I want blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">I want um a utencils to eat; and I want spoons." "</span><span class="sentence" id="1483">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">Have it." </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">And I said, "And I want some woman who...who will be in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">In every <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> is thirty <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and I want some thirty girls which I can have which I want." </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">He says, "Have them! </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">Just tell them which one you want, and have them." </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">So again, miracle [of] miracles, they thought--you know, the news traveled--that I am the protegee of Kramer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">But that's nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">Never mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">I couldn't do...I couldn't just save everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">I can't... couldn't, but where I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">I was running up and down from morning to evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">Where I could, I explained, I begged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">I...I ...1 watched the...the...the girls in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">I said, "You try your best. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">If not, I personally punish you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">And I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">I came in; and I saw that the girls didn't take care that they should have the proper kind of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">And they was a little bit [leger (ph)] on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">So I called them to the front whereI __.. And I said, "You are going..." There was water for in case there will be fire; so it was from that it would be taken, the water. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1503">Around that water," I said, "you are going to jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">Because you are here for helping, not for making yourself comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">You saw me running from morning 'til evening to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">You saw my feet um swollen like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">You look at my face, how it's swollen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">You I picked and choose, and I took you out from maybe you wouldn't be alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">So you do your duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">And now this was a punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">I know you are my friends, and I know you will be angry at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">But you will remember, because it's still better like a SS man would come in and something is not in order." </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">So that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">But this why I said I was so strict on my own friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">But one girl um who who was a...she could write poems, she got a paper and she wrote a long poem about me, to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">That, you know, she appreciates that she knows what I am doing and it was wrong for them to be negligence, a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">But, you know, persons 1s like that--1f he can make himself the life easier, he is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">But not with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">So one day Commander Kramer came... Because here was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women camp</span> , there was a <span class="DLF">road</span> and the next after the <span class="DLF">road</span> was the main <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">And often the woman husbands was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">And they just arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">So they screamed over to each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">Or sometimes the man, if he had a chance to get something extra, so he put it in a piece of paper um in in a rock and he threw it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">So...and he [NB: Kramer] found out that they are doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">So he put me in charge that I have to...Sunday when SS are not in, I have to watch it shouldn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">So I have to watch next to the um <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">I have to walk up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">But naturally I said to the girls, "When I am up, down you can talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">And...but watch if you hear some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> or whatever coming, or SS man." </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">So the little runners which we have watch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">One day Kramer came. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">All the girls disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">And he said, "What are you doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">I told myself, "You know, you put here in charge." </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">So I said-- unbelievable--I said, "I am...I want to go to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , and I am thinking what I am going to wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">I haven't got a dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">I haven't got soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">I haven't got a mirror. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">I haven't got perfume, and all those things which needed to the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">That's what I am here standing and thinking about." </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">And you...would you believe? </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">And he said, "You are right! </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">Tomorrow morning, I am coming to pick you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">And I take you there, and I get you all what you wanted." </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">And I came to the girls and I told them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">So, you know, the tragicomedy...they started to laugh.

"</span><span class="sentence" id="1556">Magda...Lageraltester, to the front! </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">Lager Commander Kramer wants you." </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">So I...I arrived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">I announced myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">He said, "So here Iam." </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">And I said, "But I need fifty people for this."

Whichever, whoever was the first fifty; and we went to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> that all the clothing was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">I never been there before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">I was standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">And I left the message through that they should prepare little...um it looked like...

</span><span class="sentence" id="2040">Who can see well? </span><span class="sentence" id="2041">Brought them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2042">And he selected so many, and they went-- who had good hands, they are good with the fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="2043">And so lot of transport went; but unfortunately, a lot of people went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2044">Which I couldn't, by all my strength 'S This was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> designated as B2c in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2045">and influence, I couldn't...

"</span><span class="sentence" id="2051">No, you are going to work harder." </span><span class="sentence" id="2052">So I said, "This is my fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="2053">I am going to work." </span><span class="sentence" id="2054">And imagine, he took me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and-- the <span class="INT_SPACE">lager kitchen</span> --and he announced to the SS woman um...um Schultz... No, I don't say the name because maybe it comes back. </span><span class="sentence" id="2055">And he said, "Here I bring you a new kapo of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2056">She will be in charge." </span><span class="sentence" id="2057">And she said, "Fine." </span><span class="sentence" id="2058">Franz. </span><span class="sentence" id="2059">Did I said Franz before? </span><span class="sentence" id="2060">Franz. </span><span class="sentence" id="2061">Because we called her "Franzka." </span><span class="sentence" id="2062">Franzka. </span><span class="sentence" id="2063">And um she had a sister there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="2064">She was working somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="2065">And um I knew that there is a kapo, a German woman, who 1s a lesbian friend--you know, because you knew those things--of a Lageraltester. </span><span class="sentence" id="2066">A German woman with a red triangle. </span><span class="sentence" id="2067">And I said, "If I take the position of her lesbian friend, how she will handle the other woman? </span><span class="sentence" id="2068">Because she will be mad; and mad on...on innocent people." </span><span class="sentence" id="2069">So I said to her, Franz...I said, "Listen, I am not good in those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2070">I wouldn't even know how to manage those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2071">She is doing a very good job." </span><span class="sentence" id="2072">But I said, "I would rather do the counting out, the Lager office work. </span><span class="sentence" id="2073">I'm good in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2074">I will count on the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="2075">How much, so many." </span><span class="sentence" id="2076">So she said, "But what will the Lagerkommandant Kramer says?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2077">I said, "He will be satisfied." </span><span class="sentence" id="2078">Like he would tell me, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2079">I said, "He will be satisfied." </span><span class="sentence" id="2080">So, in this case, he said, "Go and do the counting." </span><span class="sentence" id="2081">And I was in the counting; and another woman who used to be in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> in the C, she was suddenly here and she didn't have what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="2082">She said, "Can you help me somehow?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2083">So I said to Franz, to this SS woman Franz, "Listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="2084">There is so much work. </span><span class="sentence" id="2085">It's two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to handle and a little bit too much for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2086">Could I have another help?"

It's a German expression: "ausgefressen" [Trans: "chewed out" or "finished"; colloquialism] Which means, "what did you do wrong?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2104">What is special, more than wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="2105">And I said, "I did always to the best of the people and the running of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="2106">And he repeated it hundred times, and hundred times I said the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2107">And now when we went to...in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , so if he would go straight then that means he would take me to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2108">Suddenly, I see that he wents in. </span><span class="sentence" id="2109">And that was again to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp C</span> , where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="2110">Why I was afraid that when he said that "What did you do wrong," because I still had the letters which I didn't have time to deliver. </span><span class="sentence" id="2111">And I thought they found the letters, and now the punishment will be <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2112">But no...because he said, "Step out.

QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="2127">Weare back. </span><span class="sentence" id="2128">Um, Madga, would you tell us about being returned to Lager C?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2129">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="2130">As I mentioned it before, I was um returned by Kommandant um Kramer to Lager C. And there was a Weberei. </span><span class="sentence" id="2131">We been for a while there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2132">And in another Lager, in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> next to us a... It was emptied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2133">And there was a Lagerfthrerin, her...her name Danz, was her... And she was a terrible brutal woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="2134">But the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was emptied. </span><span class="sentence" id="2135">And also the girls, whom she was working with, um was free. </span><span class="sentence" id="2136">So she thought she will put me down, and she will put the other girls on and herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="2137">And she is push...and she pushes Grese out, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="2138">So, yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="2139">She came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ; and she says, "Magda, you are not Lageraltester anymore." </span><span class="sentence" id="2140">And she was watching me what I will say, I will beg for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2141">But I said, "That's alright." </span><span class="sentence" id="2142">So she said I will be um somewhere in a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2143">I accepted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2144">And the other girls came on, with her together. </span><span class="sentence" id="2145">But she was even more brutal than...than Grese; because she was running like crazy all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with the whip, and whipping left and right. </span><span class="sentence" id="2146">I was very sorry that is happening, but I had no way to stop her from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2147">But there was a German um prisoner, and who was really a...with a black triangle which he was a thief sometime. </span><span class="sentence" id="2148">But he was sitting many years there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2149">And he was saying there to a young girl, who he sometimes he rested in...1n her <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> ; because it was the last <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and he used to come with the kommando there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2150">And he had different privileges, so he asked if he could rest there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2151">And he told to that girl, "I will fix her! </span><span class="sentence" id="2152">Madga is coming back, and that's it!" </span><span class="sentence" id="2153">So it was really lasting three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="2154">And after three days, I was back. </span><span class="sentence" id="2155">Back again 1n the... like...like Lageraltester. </span><span class="sentence" id="2156">But it didn't last um very long, because it was coming already close to the march of January 18th [1945], when the death march started. </span><span class="sentence" id="2157">But...and may I...? </span><span class="sentence" id="2158">Before I go with the death march, I have a few interesting things which I forgot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2159">First of all, in Lager C--the first time--it was in one...1n two <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was concentrated all the young girls who was from fourteen 'til about seventeen. </span><span class="sentence" id="2160">And in one of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> --and Mengele who couldn't, you know, stand such beautiful girls, Jewish girls, being there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2161">So just when one of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was emptied, either part went on transport or the other <span class="NPIP">part</span> into the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> , he asked to transfer all the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> from one <span class="DLF">block</span> to Block 3. </span><span class="sentence" id="2162">And there, at night, they supposed to come for them to be gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2163">He put there, in the front of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , a post man. </span><span class="sentence" id="2164">Not a post man--a SS man who was...he didn't have a big...a big function, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="2165">Just a ordinary man, who should um be there on watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="2166">When I heard what happening, so I went together with the report uh writer of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="2167">And I said, "What can we do to save those children? </span><span class="sentence" id="2168">After all, from no reason whatsoever, from there one day or 'nother they should be gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2169">This is our future, if there will be a world. </span><span class="sentence" id="2170">We need that generation!" </span><span class="sentence" id="2171">So I said, "You know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="2172">We are going to approach this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="2173">And we will have a little chat with him." </span><span class="sentence" id="2174">Because it was already after the "appell," the counting; and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was no other SS man but him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2175">So I started to talk with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2176">And I said, "How are you" and so so. </span><span class="sentence" id="2177">And he told me that he is going...tomorrow morning he is going to the <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , to the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="2178">I came with the news together, and said "Oh, here is our chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="2179">We have to do something." </span><span class="sentence" id="2180">So she said, "What?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="2181">We have to get somewhere a bottle of schnapps and make him drunk." </span><span class="sentence" id="2182">So we found a bottle of schnapps. </span><span class="sentence" id="2183">Matter of fact, at that <span class="NPIP">girl's place</span> where the German with the black triangle used to rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="2184">And he left a bottle, so next day he should drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="2185">We...we searched all the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> 'til we came to that <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and there we find. </span><span class="sentence" id="2186">So I said, "Gerda, ..."" She was...that was her name. "...</span><span class="sentence" id="2187">Go there with a cup and tell him, 'Have a little um drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="2188">Tomorrow you are going to the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="2189">Be a little bit merry." </span><span class="sentence" id="2190">So he had a little drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="2191">After a while, I went and offered him a little drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="2192">Again, Gerda. </span><span class="sentence" id="2193">The fourth time, I gave him the whole bottle. </span><span class="sentence" id="2194">I said, "Look, be merry! </span><span class="sentence" id="2195">What...you know what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="2196">Forget the world." </span><span class="sentence" id="2197">He was already a little bit tipsy, so he didn't need much. </span><span class="sentence" id="2198">And when he drank the bottle, he fell asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="2199">You know, he slammed down and fell asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="2200">I said, "Gerda, that's our oppor...opportunity." </span><span class="sentence" id="2201">I went to the back of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> --which I told you there supposed to be like a <span class="INT_SPACE">wash room</span> , but wasn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="2202">I knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2203">They opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and I said, "Shhhh..." And I put the girls down in the five, about hundred a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="2204">And then I just went, and I put the girls in every <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2205">I said, "You have hundred girls more tomorrow on your counting, and don't say anything." </span><span class="sentence" id="2206">And so by the hundred I took them, and I divided them all over the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2207">And we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="2208">When everybody was divided, we just left the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , closed the <span class="DLF">door</span> ; and we went to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . '</span><span class="sentence" id="2209">Til today, we didn't know how it is possible that nobody was claiming the girls and nobody claimed anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="2210">If they killed the man, or they sent him to the <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="2211">What happened, we don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2212">But one thing I know: that in this way, we saved the eight hundred girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="2213">And the eight hundred girl... Yah, just with that thinking how can we overcome and play out at Mengele. </span><span class="sentence" id="2214">Because I was so mad at him that he did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2215">Anyway, but um later it was very interesting that... Um now I have to jump ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="2216">On that death march when we been already um going towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> ,” but I will come back to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2217">So an SS man, in a orderly manner, approached me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2218">And I don't know from what reason he asked me, "What are you from profession?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2219">I said, "My goodness me!" </span><span class="sentence" id="2220">I said, "We are going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2221">What do I need to have profession?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="2222">No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="2223">I need, because I have forty young girls here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2224">And I want you to be in charge of the forty girls." </span><span class="sentence" id="2225">And that was a part of those forty girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="2226">Where the other girls are, I don't know; but I just recently heard that they are still... A few of them, I don't know where else or how many, are living in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2227">So this is the one thing which I thought I will mention; because it was not such a easy thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2228">How when we went to sleep 'til we woke up, we thought, "My goodness! </span><span class="sentence" id="2229">If they found out..." But they didn't, thanks heavens. </span><span class="sentence" id="2230">Then (cough) the other thing which I forgot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2231">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , one um day I was called again to the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="2232">Always called to the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="2233">And the Lagerkommandant said to me that a Russian um <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> is coming here as an exchange for the Russian...for the German generals. "</span><span class="sentence" id="2234">And we found in the papers that you are a kindergarten teacher, so you will take over this whole um <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian village</span> except the the woman between eighteen 'til thirty-five. </span><span class="sentence" id="2235">The rest--the little babies, the pregnant woman, the whole, the old ones--belongs.... Um, you will take them over." </span><span class="sentence" id="2236">So I again open my mouth; and I said, "In this case, if I have to take over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian village</span> who has to be exchanged for Russian general, so I want." </span><span class="sentence" id="2237">And I put conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="2238">I said, "I want them to be bathed daily. </span><span class="sentence" id="2239">I want them to have not to stand on the app...on the counting. </span><span class="sentence" id="2240">I want to pick um sixteen girls '* Subcamp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> , located near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mecklenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2241">out from the Russian woman to be my helpers. </span><span class="sentence" id="2242">I don't want to them to stand "appell." </span><span class="sentence" id="2243">And I want them to get the food of the German SS." </span><span class="sentence" id="2244">You know, I was waiting; and I was thinking, "Madga, you crazy?! </span><span class="sentence" id="2245">What you are...(laughter) What you are asking? </span><span class="sentence" id="2246">Who are you to demand?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2247">And he said, "OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="2248">You get it." </span><span class="sentence" id="2249">And so I got the Germa...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian village</span> , with the little babies to the old woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="2250">And, naturally, didn't take them long to find out that the...how the other people lived and how they lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="2251">So they um...really, they admired me; carried me around, took me to the...to the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2252">And they said they will take me to [batushka (ph)] Stalin. </span><span class="sentence" id="2253">They take me to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to show me to Stalin. </span><span class="sentence" id="2254">Thanks very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="2255">I didn't know then (laughter)... I didn't know what Stalin is, anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="2256">And so they stayed with me, and they was very grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="2257">One thing, which is a cruel thing of the Germans; that one day they gathered all the children from about um four or six, and they send them to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2258">And matter of fact, Grese, you see--who always was telling me things... She said, "You know where they going? </span><span class="sentence" id="2259">They are going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they will be um...they will be given away to um the farmers, who hasn't got children, for adoption. </span><span class="sentence" id="2260">In a few years, they won't even know they are Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="2261">And they, the parents, will have a new genera...new children." </span><span class="sentence" id="2262">Anyway, and um also anoth...another occasion, Grese told me, "You know why we are putting Jewish woman in charge? </span><span class="sentence" id="2263">With all the strength which you wouldn't want to, I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2264">But imagine, if the war will be over and the Germans are losing, so they won't...they won't remember the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="2265">But they ... Because they don't see them so often. </span><span class="sentence" id="2266">But they will remember those girls with whom they been everyday, and who had such a hard position, when they are so hungry, thirsty and tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="2267">And now comes a woman in charge; and maybe she raises her voice or demanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="2268">Her, they will remember! </span><span class="sentence" id="2269">And that's what we want. </span><span class="sentence" id="2270">We want to be unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="2271">If we either um not succeed, but we do succeed." </span><span class="sentence" id="2272">I tell you, she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="2273">Anyway, this was the other thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2274">And now um coming back, um... So that was the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="2275">I really did...um we went to [bombard (ph)], and they had a beautiful food. </span><span class="sentence" id="2276">And imagine, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was saying, "Magda is crazy! </span><span class="sentence" id="2277">What she is doing, nobody can do that like her! </span><span class="sentence" id="2278">Demanded Russians should get the SS food, for the SS man!" </span><span class="sentence" id="2279">But anyway... Then we went on the march, which you heard it so many times displayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2280">So I'm not going to details, only...
QUESTION:  I do want to hear your story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2281">ANSWER:  You want to...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2282">QUESTION:  Yes I do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2283">ANSWER:  Yah, so when we went on the march. </span><span class="sentence" id="2284">So um before we went, so they broke in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2285">And the girls, they took what they could; because they knew what...they didn't know how long the march will be and where they are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="2286">So they took some um salami, bread, margarine, sugar and salt. </span><span class="sentence" id="2287">And they went; but naturally who... The..the SS men was running away, because they knew the Russian are coming close. </span><span class="sentence" id="2288">So they...yah, they was rushing us with all the speed possible, because they didn't want to be caught by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="2289">And anyone who...who moved down to fix her um shoes or bend down for something, they straight away um put her to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="2290">And my aim was: "Girls, we in the front." </span><span class="sentence" id="2291">Because in the back, they was shooting everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="2292">And um the girls was carrying the...that we found there some rucksacks in the <span class="INT_SPACE">store room</span> ; and they, in the rucksacks they put the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="2293">But it was heavy to run and to carry; so slowly, they threw most of the food away. </span><span class="sentence" id="2294">And what I asked them to keep is margarine and sugar, because this time we thought that this is the source of energy. </span><span class="sentence" id="2295">And so we marched, and we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2296">Ravensbrick...um we been put on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and there were just a huge <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2297">And in that <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> , we been in without food, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> --nothing, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> , no blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="2298">The situation was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="2299">I don't think...many, many um lost their life. </span><span class="sentence" id="2300">And I was very sick there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2301">But, you see, again the fate wanted something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2302">So I told you about the French woman who was so grateful to me, and there was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2303">Because they was, like I told you, intellectuals; and they was working there in the <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2304">They found out that the Birkenau girls arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="2305">So... and they came to the <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> , and they looked for Magda. </span><span class="sentence" id="2306">So they found me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2307">They took me to them, and they really brought me back to health. </span><span class="sentence" id="2308">And they...they let me have [butna (ph)] wash. </span><span class="sentence" id="2309">There they feed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2310">They been...they gave me medicament. </span><span class="sentence" id="2311">And so, 'til we had to march, I just went to the roll call there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2312">Otherwise, I been always in their <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="2313">Cough). </span><span class="sentence" id="2314">When it was the time to march farther on, I was good again. </span><span class="sentence" id="2315">But on the march, (cough) suddenly the Germans, they drove us to a empty um...like where the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> are. </span><span class="sentence" id="2316">What is it? </span><span class="sentence" id="2317">A...(cough) (Pause) Not a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , but where are the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> ....

<p><span class="sentence" id="2618">QUESTION:  When did you--just tell us, briefly--after the war about when you and Béla married and when you moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and then to...

<p><span class="sentence" id="2619">QUESTION:  Just bring us through to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2620">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="2621">When, when we...when we met then, then I said, "I'm not going to stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2622">We have to move away from here." </span><span class="sentence" id="2623">So we went first up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , and we booked in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2624">He, meantime--that's why he went away, because he wanted to earn a few...few crowns that he would have. </span><span class="sentence" id="2625">And because for those who been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , there was a possibility to get somewhere...like to settle, to start. </span><span class="sentence" id="2626">A new start, because we didn't have a penny. </span><span class="sentence" id="2627">So, so we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="2628">But Béla, being as he was--broken down, lost his wife and child--and something broke in him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2629">He didn't have that really business sense, or... So he didn't pick a big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , or big <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="2630">He picked a little...in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2631">On the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , a little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> which used to here have a woman whose husband was working and she was doing the repairs and meantime she was selling something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2632">A little... So when...when I saw that what he choosed--because he wanted away from people, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="2633">He suddenly didn't want to see many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2634">So I...I told myself, "That little <span class="NPIP">place</span> ! </span><span class="sentence" id="2635">Couldn't he pick something bigger, that we should have a chance?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2636">Because it was all empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="2637">We had to run away for material, and...and get things done. </span><span class="sentence" id="2638">And ...and you know that <span class="NPIP">place</span> had <span class="DLF">stairs</span> like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2639"><span class="DLF">Spiral stairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2640">So I had run up and be in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> and cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="2641">And...and...and sometimes customers came in, and...and I was running down. </span><span class="sentence" id="2642">And I said, "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="2643">You can't touch anything, because everything is on wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="2644">And when you touch anything, it's...(laughter) it's um ...the bells are ringing upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="2645">So, and tell 1t to everybody," I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="2646">Sometimes I had to go up; but I know, and then I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2647">And, you know, you can tell people and they believe you. </span><span class="sentence" id="2648">And they believed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2649">Anyway, so they didn't touch anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="2650">And um so we started to work it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="2651">But, you know, because really with hard work and with friendliness, with our personality, we brought people from...from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2652">And so we started to do a little prospering. </span><span class="sentence" id="2653">And then I was um pregnant with my first child...was our first child. </span><span class="sentence" id="2654">And when I was in <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> even... This time, in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , they made, you know, from feathers a little...like um feather [bed] and this is like--like I said--like a wurst, and here it gets over and you have to attach things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2655">And the baby is inside; and here is lace around. </span><span class="sentence" id="2656">And when Maya was born, so baby...Béla made it up and brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="2657">And there was a woman who didn't have that thing, and she liked it very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="2658">So Béla said, because he was so happy, he will make [for] her. </span><span class="sentence" id="2659">But then it come to pay, because he didn't have it for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2660">So worked out that her husband is a very high um in this business to checking everything; and...so he didn't want to pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2661">And when Béla demanded he should pay, so he send a committee and they gave us a punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="2662">A financial big punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="2663">Imagine! </span><span class="sentence" id="2664">I said, "Béla, you see how it happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="2665">When you're good and good-hearted, somebody--not that he doesn't say thank you because you made it for his child. </span><span class="sentence" id="2666">He makes us all our saving and our hard work went on...on it." </span><span class="sentence" id="2667">And here we been, and somebody on top of it was jealous because we brought all the customers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2668">He wanted that <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2669">So they took away the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2670">So then I went again to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to demand that what happened, and with no reason they took it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="2671">So we gave another <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2672">But now was the question that they wanted...it came a change, and they wanted Béla to be a member of the Communist Party. </span><span class="sentence" id="2673">He didn't want to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="2674">So they closed him out from the party, without being in the party. </span><span class="sentence" id="2675">And they said...again they take all the business away, because if he is not a member... So I said, "What you mean?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2676">They said, "You can have it, if you divorce him." </span><span class="sentence" id="2677">So again...so we had a lot of bad luck like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2678">The fate wanted to see how much I can endure. </span><span class="sentence" id="2679">And naturally then we got another little... I was running after this member and this member, and we got another little business. </span><span class="sentence" id="2680">But Béla had to travel, and it didn't bring much money.</span></p>
