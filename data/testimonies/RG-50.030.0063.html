<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Robert, can you just tell me your name and where you were born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Well, I'm Robert Mills Donihi D-O-N-I-H-I, born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erie</span> , <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , May 18, 1915.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  What I would like to do is to get into that period of your life where you were about to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">Tell me how it is that you got involved in the trials?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">ANSWER:  Almost accidentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">The Tennessee Bar Association -- I was practicing law in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> , and was an officer, I was actually the acting president of the Junior Bar Association. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">All the lawyer under 35 sort of grouped together and held our separate meetings at the State Bar meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We were having a meeting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Knoxville</span> that year, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I had been practicing for five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">The keynote speaker at the convention was Tom Clark, who was the Attorney General of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I met Mr. Clark while I was there, and he invited me to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> with him, when he finished his speech, and he was going to introduce me or present me to the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Having completed five years of practice, I was eligible to be sworn 1n to practice before the United States Supreme Court. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">That was quite an honor because every lawyer likes to have an Attorney General sign his submission and diploma. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">When we arrived at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Knoxville</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , I was told by the Army people, who were in charge of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , that inasmuch as I didn't have orders that I wouldn't be able to ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Well, I didn't feel like taking commercial that particular moment, so Mr. Clark suggested that I contact him when I arrived back at my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and made a decision on when I'd be coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">I had a case that was going to be coming up at the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> , and I wanted to be there for that occasion, a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I think it might have been along about September, October, and another lawyer and I were scheduled to go together. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">A chap by the name of Whitworth Stokes, another prominent lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We were staying at the <span class="BUILDING">Carlton Hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and I proceeded over to General Clark's office, went with him to the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> , was presented. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Stokes was present. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">As we came out onto the <span class="DLF">steps</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> , to my surprise Clark turned to Stokes and said, "Well, are you going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Stokes said, "I'm sorry, but I would very much like to go, but my wife 1s opposed to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Why don't you ask Bob.” </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And he said, "Would you like to go?" </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And he didn't ask me to go, but he would ask if I would like to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And I said yes I would but I would need ask my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">He said if you're interested, be in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> at 1:00 today. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So, we went back to the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I made calls <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I recall the day was of course a landmark thing for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">My family said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I told them that I had been told that it would be about 90 days of work, and that seemed like a sort of leg up in my profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I didn't expect it to be a very prominent kind of position, but I didn't even know what it would be except that it would be working with the Justice Department mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And my family said okay if it was only going to be for 90 days, why fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So, we had a tureen, if I remember well, of French onion soup sent up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> , and when I finished it, we decided I would go and went over to <span class="BUILDING">Clark's office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> to speak to an American Bar Association meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Alice O'Donnell and Grace Murphy, who were his chief secretary and Administrative Assistant there, had been told by him that I might be coming and they were expecting me and they called the Chief of what was known as "Project K" as I learned later, for Keenan. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Keenan was former head of the criminal division of the Department of Justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">He had been Roosevelt's right arm, as liaison to the Senate. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">He had a particular friendship with Senator McKeller of <span class="REGION">Tennessee</span> , whom I knew, and Senator McKeller was Chairman of the Senate, a very powerful Senate Finance Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So, Keenan was known by Roosevelt as Joe the Key because he was able to get Roosevelt's economic packages through the Senate with relative friendly ease. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">That was very important to the President. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Keenan was known as a king maker in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I think his name today, all these years later, has very little significance, but at that time he was known by people to have recommended persons through the United States Supreme Court to the <span class="BUILDING">Cabinet</span> and high positions otherwise, and known as a king maker. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So, Keenan had been called by the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> staff, either Alice O'Donnell or Grace Murphy saying that I was coming down, and I remember the language well. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">She said the Attorney General wants Mr. Donihi to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So, I went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I didn't know at that time, but Senator McKeller had been contacted by Keenan and McKeller recommended me very highly. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">I didn't know that myself, because I later contacted one of our Senators who in turn again contacted McKeller. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">But in any case, Keenan was influenced by the fact that McKeller -- he had the option of choosing me or not choosing me. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Apparently they began a process of investigating and I went back, not knowing what was going to happen, I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">In fact, his Deputy, a chap by the name of John Darcian, Assistant Attorney General, was very discouraging. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">He said we have no money to employ you because it's a Justice Department Staff man that's going; as we have no funds. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">There's no use even talking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He was trying to discourage me from even wanting to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So, I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> not knowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Subsequently--but I did make a contact with Senator Tom Stewart, our Junior Senator from <span class="REGION">Tennessee</span> who said, "Well, I'll talk to Senator McKeller and we'll get a recommendation over to the Attorney General.” </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I didn't realize that Keenan had already received a recommendation. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So, that really sort of nailed it for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I was unaware of why or how, but patronage does seem to work that way, and I arrived back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> some days or weeks later there was a telegram that came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stokes</span> , saying that if you are not going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> please contact Donihi. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So he called and said, "They seem to want you. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They told me they were processing at a given date in November. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I came up, and then I was sworn to secrecy on everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">You can't tell anyone that you're employed or what's going to happen or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">It was "Project K.” And I recall very well going up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , there was an army captain who's father had been a United States Senator from <span class="REGION">Tennessee</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">In fact his father had captured the Kaiser in World War I and became famous as a result, and that sort of propelled him into political life. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He became a U.S. Senator and a Financier in <span class="BUILDING">Rogers Coldwell firm</span> , Duke Lee, Jr. was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and I recall that he said, "What takes you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , Bob?" </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And I said, "Oh, just some routine business.” </span><span class="sentence" id="68">At the end of the day we were on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , or the next day it was, we were on the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> and he said, "Bob, did you have anything unusual happening in your day?" </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I said, "No, no, just routine, how about you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="70">The same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">The next day to our mutual embarrassment, our pictures appear side by side in the National Tennessean telling the story and that's the first time I knew exactly what I was going to be doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">That we would be ring side in the trial of the Emperor if he was tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I was sort of flabbergasted, because so far as I knew "Project K" had nothing but a name. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Stokes seemed to think it would have something to do with the rewriting, recodifying of the laws of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , which wouldn't quite have been my thing, but I would have been glad to have the experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">The other, trial law, more my forte, I was happy to have an opportunity to work with lawyers who were more experienced of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Well, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I went off to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> expecting to carry books mostly and briefcases for some of the more experienced lawyers, but to my happy surprise, I was used in the trial itself as one of the trial counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">In a project known, as let's see it wasn't a project, we divided it into phases and it was called the "Preparation of Japanese Opinion for War Phases, Police Control, Censorship" that sort of thing, and that was my phase, the very beginning of the trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">The trial became the longest in history at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I guess it still 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I was only there for one year, but you know, the 90 days were interrupted by a tragedy in my own family, and I had to keep working because we needed the funds. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So, I kept working until it was possible to get my family together again. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We had a tragic fire at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So, fortunately I was making what then was considered to be very good money. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I was able to send every penny <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because everything was taken care of in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , my board, my laundry, my driver, my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , my PX supplies, everything was handed to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">There was no reason for money at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  When were you assigned to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , what was the year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Well, we arrived there on Pearl Harbor day of 1945, which was on the anniversary, the fourth anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Actually at Pearl Harbor, it would have been December 7. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">In <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> it was December 8, because of the time line difference, one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So, we arrived there I presume for whatever that propogandic value that might have to be there precisely on the day, four years to the day later. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">That trial was much different than the trials in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for me because we were a twelve nation trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">The Judges -- there were eleven judges on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> , one of them representing two <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Eleven chief prosecutors from the various <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , so my job, I had several bosses and all of them telling me what to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Did you know prior to coming about the war crimes commission? </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Did you learn about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Of course all lawyers had some concept, if you were interested at all in world affairs, you knew what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">These world affairs and the war trials and the war crimes, the London Conference, the Cairo Conference, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Yes, I had some knowledge of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Inever dreamed that I'd be involved in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">First of all, I had no proficiency in Japanese whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I didn't know German at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I spoke some Russian and Spanish, and of course that didn't suit me for either of the assignments, but I did find that English was the official language of the trial in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And everything was on a simultaneous translation basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We had soundtracks when we were standing at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">podium</span> wearing headphones. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Sorry I don't have pictures that show, yes I do think I have one, but the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , the U.S. VA Graduate School, which I'll be teaching a course in foreign affairs in a few weeks, they had that picture and they were going to return it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">It's the only one I had of me while I was trying -- it turned out not to be the Emperor of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">As you know, politically, he was excused from the trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">He wasn't tried, he wasn't indicted. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We tried Tojo as the lead person and all of the other 27 who were high ranking officers, we thought the top people. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">There were many other trials, but they were in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yokohama</span> , some in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">This was only one international trial in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> --the Tojo case.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Can you tell me something about the preparation of that trial and what it was that you did?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Well, we were broken into several phases. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Preparation for Japanese opinion for war being the phase the I was assigned to. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">There were several of us, three lawyers actually, who were working on that phase, and I had the duty of interviewing people who were related to the press, the movie industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We didn't have television in those days, and the newspapers and all of the various media used in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> to bring about the raising of antipathy against the <span class="REGION">western nations</span> , preparation for war, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">To prepare the Japanese mind to accept this, because there had been a lot of pro-western feeling, I think, mostly pro-American feeling, by even a lot of the top leaders in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">The strata of administration of the trial with Keenan as chief American counsel also elected by his peers to be chief prosecutor of the international prosecution section as we were known a part of SCAPs, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Power which translates to MacArthur. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Actually, although MacArthur is historically given credit for the trials, it's sort of a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">In fact, Keenan's orders, own orders were equal to those of MacArthur. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They were presidential orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">I think all of the people who are aware of that period know that President Truman was not reluctant to fire the supreme commander of the Allied Powers, so the title didn't have a whole lot to do with whether or not the President was able to fork his will on the individuals who were American citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So, Keenan's presidential orders were equal to those of MacArthur. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But, Keenan I think, to my sorrow at the time and continued, Keenan apparently felt reluctant, maybe it was on presidential instructions, but Keenan seemed to be reluctant to go off on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">He sort of surrendered his authority to MacArthur when we got there, and became a part of the Supreme Command. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So, instead of being the International Prosecution Section for the <span class="REGION">Far East</span> , it became a part of the Supreme Commander staff, even though we were called International Prosecution Section, it was the <span class="BUILDING">General Headquarters</span> , MacArthur. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">This had a very distinct, I think probably a weakening effect of the end results of the trial, because here we had all of the constituent members of what became the United Nations Security Council, were there on the <span class="BUILDING">Court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">You had <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and the Soviet Union and Great Britain and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">All of the nations who were vying for top authority within the Security Council were there and could have taken it upon themselves at that point to become the United Nations representative in International War Crimes Trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">But you see, that didn't happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">It became more or less an American show because it was McArther. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Even though we had the other <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> 1n, it was international only to a limited extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">The American dollar was paying for it, which I guess, had to be expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We had no subsequent proceedings. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I'm getting a little ahead of myself because in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> the same thing prevailed, incidentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It was also a part of the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">It was International Military Tribunal. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We were International Military Tribunal for the <span class="REGION">Far East</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">When the people at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , after Justice Jackson had come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he had been the chief prosecutor at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> , when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the Soviets had withdrawn, gone back to their zone of operation, so had the French, so had the British, leaving whatever was left of the American staff at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> under the charge of a very competent lawyer by the name of Telford Taylor, who still lives and who's at Columbia teaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">He must be in his 90s by now. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">He's a very capable lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">But he decided, for whatever reasons, possibly again on | don't know if it was Presidential orders, but for whatever reason, he decided that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> should continue in an international vein. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">That is, all the trials that would be held at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> under his direction from then on were to be called international trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">His tribunals would all be known as international military tribunals. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">It was sort of a fiction because they were manned only by Americans who are very capable judges, prosecutors who are American, very capable prosecutors. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I think very excellent prosecutors. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Almost all personnel with the exception of those employed to do the translating and interpreting were of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So, I felt that 1t was a fiction. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We had voted this idea down 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I was on a committee to determine whether we would hold what was called "subsequent proceedings under American authority" but to be called international. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Well, aside from that, the trials were very similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">The Tokyo trial was much like the Nuremberg trial, but the language was a barrier to public comprehension. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">The faces were different. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The Japanese were not as easily depicted to the American imagination and mind as were the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">The German Bund was something that we could comprehend in their swashbuckling style, but the Japanese methods were very foreign to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So, their infiltrative process -- as a matter of fact we misunderstood them to such an extent, that a lot of the Japanese U.S. citizens were thrown in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , as you know, when Pearl Harbor came about. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I think today that wouldn't happen because we understand the Orientals better than we did then. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I don't know what we would have done with the German American Bund. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It seems to me that a lot of those fellows probably should have gone to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> that didn't go. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Do you understand what I'm saying here? </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Well, the strata I started to get at, that would be with MacArthur seemingly at the top as the Appellate Authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">It shouldn't have been that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">The Appellate authority really should have been the President of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and I suppose ultimately it was, but MacArthur's been presented historically as the top authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And Keenan as the chief prosecutor, the justices were working under the leadership of Sir William Webb of <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , who was the Chief Justice of the Tribunal. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , just for the purposes of identifying the Americans, the U.S. representative was a fellow by the name of John P. Higgins. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">John Patrick Higgins, who had been the Chief Justice of the Superior Court system in <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> , very bitterly opposed by Keenan. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Keenan didn't want him on the <span class="BUILDING">Court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Unfortunately Higgins found that out, because when he was appointed, he had served in the Congress at one time with President Truman when Truman was a Congressman. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">The result of that was that they had an affection for each other and Truman appointed him after having asked Keenan what he thought of him, over Telecon, which is a very slow process of communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I guess he figured that when you asked someone, when the President asked you're going to say, "Oh, yes, Mr. President we like him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But Keenan had sent a scathing kind of a commentary back over Telecon which the fate had been accomplished at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Higgins had been named. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">He had arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , was able to read all the exchange of communications including that which was distressing to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">He possibly if he had been a different person might have quit on the spot, but he didn't want to put anybody in a position of embarrassment. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So, he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I talked to him many times, and he was an awfully nice gentleman. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">A very fine justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">The Chief Justice was extremely fond of him and they came to look upon each other as being equal in their comprehension of the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But Higgins waited until an appropriate time and then he threw a bomb into the works by quitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">He didn't quit in a manner that should have embarrassed anyone, but he just said, that there had been many deaths on the <span class="BUILDING">Courts</span> in <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> and I have to go back and take care of things, take charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So, he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">That had the effect of sort of pricking a balloon, taking a lot of the steam out of the nature of the -- the press for example were wondering what's this going to amount to with no American Justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So, Truman called one Judge Advocate General by the name of Myron C. Cramer. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">The Army's Judge Advocate General of some previous years, called him back to active duty and sent him over there in military uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">That in itself started to play down the public comprehension of the kind of trial that it was, with an American General on the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Well, you didn't look at it the same way as you would have if you had a member of the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> or a former member of the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> , or even Higgins. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">So, the result of that was that there were two generals at that time, only two generals on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">One was the Soviet General and I think it was , and the other was our own General, Myron Cramer. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">This all happened in mid-stream so it had a lot of scholars began to look at the thing and say how in the world is a justice going to be able in good faith to sit down and command the evidence as it's gone in so far and properly meet out justice. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Well, he could of course, but nonetheless it had a watering down effect on the trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">So, in any case, my phase of the case was over with. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I worked under a couple of very top level committees, the evidence committee which decided what I could and could not present into evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">It was all screened out very carefully and they determined whether it would fit my phase of the case and whether I should put in. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">All the lawyers did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And the other committee, which was called the Executive Committee, what it really amounted to was Keenan and all the other chief prosecutors from the various <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> who would make determinations of who would be presenting evidence and what evidence seemed inappropriate. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">They were trying to coordinate everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And then there was a coordinating committee down the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="199">So, there was really three committees that we would go through before we even got to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">QUESTION:  Were there defending lawyers and prosecuting lawyers on the <span class="REGION">American side</span> also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  Yes, the Department of Justice, I think, primarily had sent lawyers over at the request of MacArthur, I presume. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Every one of the accused, there were 28, had an American counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">In addition to which, they also had Japanese counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Tojo refused American counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">He didn't want American counsel, and to my thought, perhaps the most intelligent lawyer, the best scholar in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> was probably Tojo's lawyer, Dr. Kiosi (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I have very high regard for him and his capacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">As a matter of fact, I have very high regard for the ability of Tojo himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">When you're dealing with people like that you can't just water them off as being enemies. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">There is something very special about a man who's able to become the Prime Minister of his <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Tojo was known as old razor brains, and I can see why.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  Did you interrogate Tojo?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  Yes, but the system we used in the interrogation of Tojo one man on our staff was promised the sole and exclusive right to the cross examination of Tojo. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">In other words, Tojo was going to be his accused. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I was assigned two people. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">General Hiroki, who had been sort of the tutor and sort of a well guiding force and godfather behind Hirohito as he was growing up, up through his years and until he became the Prince Regent, took over for his father in about 1928 or 1929. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">General Hiroki was the oldest accused in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">She probably had more influence on what happened in later years than anyone else there. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Hiroki and the other was Hiroto. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Hiroto was a diplomat and had been a foreign minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">These were my two for preparation for ultimate cross examination, which I never did conduct because I came here and then later went to Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because of emergencies and then went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> after I had gotten the emergency somewhat in hand, but I had to keep working until I thought everything was right with my family again. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> -- I had resigned to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> thinking I was through. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">When I got back, I found that I wasn't able to really get away. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">My law practice had dribbled out. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Other lawyers had ruminants of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I had been gone almost a year, and I needed a job very badly and one had been offered in the European trials, so I accepted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">But I sort of lost the trend of my thought there for a second with regard to the --
QUESTION:  What was it like to meet Tojo?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  Tojo was what we were talking about a moment ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It seems to me, or I was talking about, Jack Feeley, who had been I think the Solicitor General, he was either an assistant Solicitor General of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or the Solicitor General, also head of, if I remember correctly, of the Justice Department at one time, Criminal Division of the Justice Department at one time, had been promised by Keenan that he would be the sole and exclusive counsel to cross examine and prepare the case against Tojo, and this of course was more or less a center piece of the trial once the Emperor was out of the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So, that was Feeley's role. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">A very interesting fact that that promise was given to him all the way from the very beginning which lends itself to whether or not there was some question about whether the Emperor would be tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">You see, we didn't know it until down the <span class="DLF">line</span> some weeks later whether or not the Emperor was actually going to be tried or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">But I think Keenan had a pretty good idea because he was promising the chief individual in the trial, or what seemed to be the chief individual in the trial, Tojo, to this one man. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">It seems to suggest that back as early as our departure date which was the 2nd of December 1945, that there was some knowledge, but we did have a message delivered to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> just before departure. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">It came from the President. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Presidential car</span> came with this seemingly secret message to Keenan, and we knew it had to do with the Emperor because we were told after that that we would not be permitted to interrogate anyone in the <span class="BUILDING">Royal household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">That seemed to suggest many things that were happening in retrospect. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">It suggests also that the Emperor might not be tried, probably wouldn't be tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Whether that had been a decision made, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">We do know that the people who are foremost in making that decision aside from the President himself, on the <span class="REGION">United States side</span> , were John McCloy who was the --well he was really running the War Department under Stimson in that time period, and MacArthur of course had a voice in it as did Joseph Grew who had been our Ambassador in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">All of these were opposed to the trial of the Emperor. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Now, the Soviets wanted him tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">So did the British, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">There were various people who wanted the Emperor tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">The <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> had the most to lose in that situation, if you can believe that by trying the Emperor that the Japanese would have fought to the last inch. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">It was thought that the assault on Honshu' which was being planned, might have cost millions of lives, American lives, and more millions of Japanese lives so that it would have been a wise practical decision to say, well, all it's going to take to have peace 1s you can have your Emperor. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">It was easy to lay the blame on the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">The Emperor, the assistant in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , the Emperor would have of course be following to a large extent, he was not quite the mouth piece that some people might have described to him for the military just saying yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">When I say the mouthpiece, I mean the yes-man. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">He had more voice than that, but he seemed to go along pretty well with what was wanted in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">The Navy was opposed, for example, to the attack on Pearl Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">The Army was pushing for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">The Navy had to carry it out, of course and did it with dispatch. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But they had fought against the concept. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">A number of the Navy people felt that it was a losing war if we did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">It appears that they were right. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tojo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So, Feeley had total authority as to whether or not one would get to talk with Tojo at Sogolmo (ph) Prison. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">When I wanted to talk to Tojo, I had to do it through Feeley. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Generally, if I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">Sogolmo Prison</span> with him, I could, but I was not permitted to speak, nor were any other lawyers to speak personally with Tojo, except off the record. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Off the record we might have a few comments, but on the record, that which was to become part of his official affidavit sworn testimony, my name would not appear in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Although there would be questions in it which I had propounded through Feeley which I would use in turn in my phase of the trial about censorship, propaganda, police controls and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I recall one incident sort of 1n passing concerning the fact of his being called "Old Razor Brains" while we were there one very cold day in December or January, that winter of '45-'46, a couple of plumbers came into this little <span class="INT_SPACE">interrogation room</span> at <span class="BUILDING">Sogolmo Prison</span> and those of us who were there were the interpreter was a Commander Maxim has written a book about his experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">He was the interpreter, Jeff, he was an American Commander, a Navy man. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Myrtle Mills was Feeley's own secretary who was taking notes. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Feeley himself with me, and of course Tojo. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Two fellows ' The largest of the <span class="REGION">Japanese islands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">came in, two Japanese workmen began to pound on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radiators</span> , it was terribly cold, with their wrenches. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And the girl said "Hubba, Hubba" so they got up and went out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">That was being interpreted as very slang, so Tojo said something in Japanese to Maxim, the interpreter and they both began to laugh. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">They hubba-hubba back and forth a little bit, an then it was explained to us that Tojo said that every night when he left that particular <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , the guards would poke him in the back with their billy clubs and say hubba hubba and up until now he had always believed that meant remember Pearl Harbor. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">He knew it would get a laugh out of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I'm sure he didn't really mean that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  Did you travel through <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> and see --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  Mostly unofficial. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">The workload was almost unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">We were rushing for the indictment and rushing for the first day of trial, and rushing because I had to present the first witnesses 1n the trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So, for me, the pressures were almost inhuman and in particular with the load at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">My anxious feelings about getting back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> took the romance out of the job really for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But I did fly over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hiroshima</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nagasaki</span> and other major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">I wanted to see -- the Army at my request took me over it, the major <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> so I could see the damage and it was unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I couldn't properly describe the effect of one bomb on a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> like say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hiroshima</span> for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Although the damage in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yokohoma</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nagasaki</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> itself from the fire bombs was beyond belief, too, but you could comprehend that to some extent because the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were so fragile, a lot of bamboo and paper structures. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> would be wiped out with a small bomb, a fire bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And occasional weekends there were several of us, Feeley, myself, John Darcey who was the Assistant Attorney General of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in charge of one of the divisions there, and Henry Sacket, later a federal judge, Elton Hyder, Elton has become oil rich in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">He went back and became a very effective lawyer in big oil cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We traveled together usually, all or part of us, and we'd go for one overnight trip we'd go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atomi</span> (ph), which was a seaside resort, wherever, just to get the feeling of being away for a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">It gave us a trip out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but it wasn't every weekend and it wasn't a very, it wasn't really a vacation type of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">It was sort of a quick breather to get out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and we'd carry some K rations with us, dry field rations to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">It's about the way we were living on weekends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">QUESTION:  Can you tell me something about what happened at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and how that --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  Well, my wife, within days after I had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> , had gone to visit her family in <span class="REGION">Alabama</span> with our twin sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">We had twin sons then who had born in 1944, so they were just a little over one year old, and she was expecting another child at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">She was a few weeks pregnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">That was one reason the 90 day period seemed to be almost essential. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">On Christmas Eve I got the word that she had been very critically burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">She apparently had something back in the way of a housecoat from the cleaners that possibly had a lot of flammable liquid used in it and she had backed up too close to an open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> at her <span class="BUILDING">parent's home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And they lived a great distance from a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , so the burns, I guess, just kept getting worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">By the time she got to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> from their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which was in <span class="REGION">Hamilton Alabama</span> to sort of a small sort of a <span class="BUILDING">country hospital</span> in a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">Russlerove Alabama</span> , she was really in very bad condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">So, there had been a lot of efforts to reach me, but for some strange reason Red Cross couldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">My friend Mike Hoffman, I got to talk to him about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">They apparently tried through various means and couldn't get communications very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Finally one lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> called, who knew the Attorney General, called General Clark and said "Did you know?" </span><span class="sentence" id="304">and he said no he didn't so Clark then immediately sent MacArthur a message ordering me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Without asking any further questions, MacArthur's staff prepared the orders for me and told me that I must go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> right away because she was in critical condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I was told that she wasn't expected to live through the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But I remember that I knelt by her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and said prayers with her at that time and we were both pretty desperate about the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I called friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> that said they would make arrangements, and they did, with an expert in skin grafting. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">All I had was this one doctor's word that she wasn't going to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">They arranged to send an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> down to this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and we sent her back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> , a distance, I guess probably nearly 200 miles in an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> which in itself she had to be heavily sedated and have a nurse with her who was a friend of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And we had a <span class="INT_SPACE">private room</span> set up for her in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with a telephone and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">It was imperative that I had to that if she could be taken off the critical list at all, that I had to go back in order to continue drawing a salary, because I had turned my practice over to another lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And really, I was in no emotional condition to try anybody's case at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So, I did, we got her settled back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> , in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and she had some skin grafts and appeared to be rallying to some extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">But it was a couple of years before she was fully out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> for skin grafting. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I think it was 1948 before the last of the burns had healed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  Did she lose the baby?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  Yes, the baby was lost at once, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">She miscarried even before she got to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So, that was it, and then when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at the end of approximately a year, when I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> , because her telephone calls -- I would call her once a week from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> , she had a telephone right at her bedside and that we could discuss how she felt about whether she felt well enough to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="322">As a matter of fact, she was well enough to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but she needed 24 hour around the clock care. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">So, when I got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> , I resigned, came back and took her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we had a nurse that had taken a strong friendship liking to her and wanted to continue and she stayed at our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and took care of my wife until she came to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">She was really not in a great condition to come to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but I went over and made several trips back and forth from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I was able to do that relatively easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I flew back and forth to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to see her in between, but it was again, almost a year before she could come to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And then we continued her skin grafting after she got there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">QUESTION:  After she got to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">ANSWER:  After she got to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but she was able to do that on an outpatient basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">Just go in for a few days and come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">This went on until 1948 from 1945.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">QUESTION:  This must have been a great strain on you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">ANSWER:  Unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">It was really unbelievable on both of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">It's hard to recapitulate that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It's so painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">We had three more children after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">All of them survived except one got killed as a result of a wounds in the Viet Nam war. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">He was a Marine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  How did you get to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  I had been asked -- when I first came back I had been asked, I had to report at Keenan's request amongst other things to report to the Attorney General and the War Department. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Oh, I hadn't said that the way I was paid, because the Justice Department truly didn't have the funds, they merely asked the War Department to pay me and put me on the War Department payroll. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And it created some difficulty because some of the more senior lawyers were getting less money than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">It was a personnel problem for some of those who were justice department lawyers and therefore sort of bureaucratically inclined. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">The money meant more to them perhaps than it might to Edward Bennet Williams wouldn't have cared it was $1 or $10,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">$10,000 in those days was the top salary. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So, these fellows who were getting $8,000, $9,000 and had pretty good jobs as professional grade sixes and sevens, eight was the top, and I came along at the top of the six bracket, getting over $9,000 a year because I was given an overseas override. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">They were -- the Justice lawyers were given I think $10 a day, which today of course would be ridiculous but at that time it was a pretty good per diem. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">They got $10 a day per diem and the Army took it away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">The Army, I think was rather vicious in that regard, they said you don't work for us, you work for the Justice Department, so that $10 is for your board and <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , give it to us, and they took it. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">In my case, they didn't take anything because I was a War Department lawyer even though I wasn't really. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">It was one of those comical bureaucratic mixups. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I was very happy for the mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">We needed the money badly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  When did you get to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER:  I left as I remember it was December 4, 1946, and I went over on a very slow <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , by my choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I wanted, I really needed a rest, and as far as I was concerned I was on the payroll from the minute I left and it seemed like a good opportunity, so I went over, and it was a very slow trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> on New Years Eve 1946 going into 1947, New Years Eve at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I met with Telford Taylor and some of the others there, celebrated with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">I had spent Christmas in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because orders were issued to me and reissued to me along the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I really didn't know where I was going to end up. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I was sent first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidenburg</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidenburg</span> I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">It was a very happy experience because every <span class="NPIP">place</span> was new. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">My wife was not permitted to come over while I was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , but at the time of as the war crimes ended, when was it? </span><span class="sentence" id="366">It must have been the end of '47, I think we had been ordered to close it down by the beginning of 1948, and while I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> interrogating Rudolf Hess, I stopped over to see an old acquaintance who was the Solicitor General of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at one time, and later became a U.S. Federal Judge on the Court of Appeals here in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">District of Columbia</span> , Charlie Fehe( ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="367">He was heading the legal staff for military government. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So, while I was there to interrogate Hess, I stopped over and talked to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">He was getting ready to come back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and ask me if I would like to join the staff in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and I said, I sure would, because I didn't want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> where it would be a reviewing job. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I didn't like reviewing these cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I had gone through them so carefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">The ones that I handled, many of which I handled in the pretrial and others which of course I personally tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">There were literally thousands of cases that seemed to be going across my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , but I'm talking more in terms, I guess, of people than I am of individuals rather than cases because so many of these cases would include any number of persons up to 100. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">I'm sure in some instances. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So, it seemed to me that there were literally thousands of cases against thousands of persons going across my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And I would review these, all the evidence that had been gathered on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I had my own opinions about whether they should be tried or not and then I would pass them along with a suggestion that they be tried or they not be tried or that they be reviewed by someone else so that it was sort of part of a chain link proposition, a <span class="DLF">pipeline</span> before they got to trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">In many cases, I'd put a case aside because I wanted to try it myself for one reason or because others didn't want to try it. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">If I wanted to try it and felt that it should be tried, I'd try it. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I'm not sure how many lawyers may have been doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I was known as a chief trial attorney. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">That was my title. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I worked under well really three other lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">One the head of the War Crimes Detachment which we normally call the Dachau contingent was a fellow by the name of Straight, Brigadier General Straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Under him was a Colonel Howard Brissey. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Brissey was the head of the Dachau detachment, where the trials actually were held, but the chief of the trial branch who was really my immediate overseer and boss was Leo Goodman. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Leo had been an Army Colonel I think and before he died he had become -- two principle jobs he held. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">One was head of the American Chamber of Commerce in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but before that he was Counsel General, I believe, he went into diplomatic service. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">Well, Leo was the one I had to report to most directly and we had day to day contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">The others were looking at him and he was looking at them, but this was my chain of command. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">He was very competent, a very competent lawyer and a very nice man to work with and for. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">We were very good personal friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">I enjoyed that experience, I guess more because of him than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">It would have been very lonesome. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">He was a bachelor and he later married in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">He was a man of great high moral values and if 1t hadn't been for him I don't think I could have stood the thing away from family and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">So, anyhow, he wanted me to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> as we were closing down the trial branch and I said, "Gee I don't think it's my thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I've had this thing offered to me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And he said, "Well, what if I won't approve of it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I said, "Well, I think you certainly have that option. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Out of all the things you've done for me I could hardly be angry about it but I would still say no.” </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Well, you have to pay your own way back you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Well, I'd be willing to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">My wife was probably well enough for me to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and take over things without the worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">He said, "Oh well, go ahead and take the job.” </span><span class="sentence" id="407">It meant a promotion, so I was glad to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I was then on Lucius Clay's staff, legal staffin <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> during the blockade in a position known as General Counsel on High Priority Policy Matters. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">It really meant dealing with the Soviets as much as anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">That's about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  What did that job entail?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  Somebody from the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> told me that they had read some of the opinions that I had written and were complimenting the fact that I had given the Italians back all of their artwork, that gives you an idea, the restitution of property. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Just many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">It really meant that I was doing a policy job of involving international matters that had to be adjudicated based as best we could on what law we had to work with and claims of other <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">We worked on the currency reform matter, for example, which resulted in a break with the Soviets as you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I guess somebody might know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">QUESTION:  How did you get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="418">ANSWER:  I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> on the first or second of January of 1947 and as soon as I reported I was put to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I wasn't given a chance to do much except take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and start looking at cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">The first thing that I was doing was interrogating various people who had already been interrogated by investigators, trying to decide whether or not the testimony would stand up. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Looking at the record of what evidence was there to try cases, and I started trying cases myself first with some of the other lawyers who had been there awhile and then later as the Chief Counsel in whatever trials I was taking on. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Really, in an administrative matter am I getting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I would like to have stayed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> except for one thing, and that was the subsequent proceedings ran contrary to two things. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">One my own personal belief in calling something international that has really become unilateral as they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">It had the color internationalism because it was all being done on international law to some extent. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">But it was not international law as far as personnel was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I felt that if maybe the French of the British would have stayed there or the Soviets that they -- it was only bilateral. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">You could still call it international and it would stick, but when all but the Americans had gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and the American Judges and the American prosecutors or the people who had to deal with it you have to appeal to only one source from then on and that's the Supreme Court of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and that becomes an American Trial as far as I am concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">Now, the <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Court</span> held me wrong in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">One of the trials-- I have to say very quickly that those cases at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> were very well tried, excellently tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And I think all the lawyers, all the Judges that I knew were splendid. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">They did their job very well, so I wouldn't fault that. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I just had this strong feeling against calling something what it isn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">But the Supreme Court of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> held against my thinking in the Frederick Flick case. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And I knew Flick. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Flick had asked me to defend him at a later time. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">What he actually asked, after he had been imprisoned, he had a relatively shortened prisonment and was at <span class="BUILDING">Lansburg prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">I had a request while I was still trying cases at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , I had gotten quite a bit of publicity in the German press as a result of that Lottenbaucher(ph) case. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">I think that gave the wrong impression to the Germans, that maybe I was sympathetic with the Germans, which I was not, with the Nazis, which I certainly was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">But after all, he was one of the top people in the German government, and head of the Hitler youth, and he was acquitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">So a lot of these Germans thought perhaps that they needed my services. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Baroness Von , | think she was a Baroness, she came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and asked me if I would go she said her husband had requested that I come down and see him at <span class="BUILDING">Landsberg prison</span> , that he had been convicted by a <span class="BUILDING">war crimes court</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">China</span> and this really piqued my curiosity because I was doing some writing anyhow about the various <span class="BUILDING">war crimes court</span> , and I wanted to find out more about that, to that extent I wanted to talk with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">I did go down. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">He had been a diplomat in the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beijing</span> (ph.) </span><span class="sentence" id="445">He had been tried by a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , which I thought had died really about World War I days, but apparently he had been tried by <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Apparently that didn't cause the State Department any kind of turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">They normally, I think, might have said, well we have no business doing that and turned it over to the Army, but he was convicted and somehow ended up in <span class="BUILDING">Lansburg Prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">But what he wanted to see me about was the fact that he was a friend of Frederick Flick. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Now Flick was running the . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Flick was really big league and what Puttcomer said to me is that Mr. Flick who was present during this conversation that we were conversing in English primarily although by that time I did speak a workman like kind of German, but we were talking in English and Puttcomer said that "Flick says if he is released from <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> that he has the plan for rebuilding <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> on the cuff of his sleeve.” </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Interesting commentary. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Well, apparently he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Because as you know when he was realised--So, he wanted to know if I would take the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I said, "You know, I have a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I'm an insider and I'm not sure that I can get released to do it, but if I can, can we talk money.” </span><span class="sentence" id="456">He said, "Well would you talk with my board at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Apparently it was what was the makings of the new Farbinworth (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I talked with them, and we agreed that if I could, my job in this case would be to make an appeal on this case to see if I could at least get clemency and get him out on the grounds that he really could do something about the rebuilding of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And the whole thrust at that point of our new policy with Marshall Plan and so on coming in was to do just exactly that to try to rebuild <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So, it seemed like an interesting concept. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I wasn't at all sympathetic with the slave labor thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">As you know, I had tried a number of people because I felt that slave labor was something that people shouldn't prosper from. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And I tried persons who had been kind to slave labor, thinking of the Schindler movie, for example, turning that over in my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Probably had his case come across my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , I would personally have tried him, because I think he shouldn't have escaped simply because he was willing to try to help some people. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">He wasn't such a great person himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">You know, if you want to be just about it, he was probably not any different than some of the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I did try one, a couple of brothers, not brothers, a couple of relatives I think they were the Wuelfert Meat Packing. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I was wandering a little bit here. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Robert, I'd like you to give us a sense of the process. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">How did they choose perpetrators? </span><span class="sentence" id="472">How did they get them? </span><span class="sentence" id="473">How did you decide the cases? </span><span class="sentence" id="474">What kind of cases came across your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Can you give us a sense of what the process was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  I think I can give a sense of the choice both in Europe and in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> and there was a little variation and it probably has to do with employment of personnel as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">The personnel employment started at the very top level, as I indicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">The Attorney General, then Keenan and eventually both at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> the authority passed to the War Department, who were engaging different persons for jobs here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> insofar as the accused were concerned, we started with several lists. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">The State Department the Foreign Service had lists of persons who were likely suspects. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So did the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So did the various <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> who came in and we took these and we were able to find the common denominator amongst all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">They all presumably had Tojo on them, for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">I don't want to say the Emperor. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">I can't recall that any of the U.S. lists had the Emperor on specifically. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Some of the foreign lists did. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">In Europe the personnel thing worked pretty much the same way, and so did the choice of the original persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We had four <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> that were looking at lists in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Arriving at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , the people who you had lists of names -- first of all, you knew immediately who was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when you took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">General Jacob Devors, who I think was Eisenhower's operations officer on the invasion, I was on a lecture tour with him, oh a number of years after the trials, but he told me that one of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> had overrun <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and he had gone in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Well, they could hardly believe their eyes when they saw the conditions of the inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">In his case, just as a matter of some interest, I got back into the subject of witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">There are two categories. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">There was the German people who lived around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> as well as those that were inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">He was so outraged by what he found there that he had his troops round up everybody that they could find in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and bring them out there to see what was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">He said from the looks on the faces of the German people, of the residents of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , he was inclined to believe that they did not really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Well, it was one of those things, speak no evil, hear no evil, you don't see no evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I think that's perhaps it more than anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">They knew, but they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">They chose not to know, because you couldn't not really know. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">In any case, he believed that they were ignorant of the facts. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Now, you have all these terrible things that you find there. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Stacks of bodies, emaciated persons, people who are hardly able to -- you get a lot of names. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">These are people who are going to be used possibly as witnesses at what took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">No matter where they went, they eventually got some requests to come back and testify. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Those who were surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And they were given an opportunity, those who came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Now, this was not just <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , of course it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> , you name them, all of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  You mean the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> trials included more than --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  From our perspective they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">They included all of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">They included all of the atrocities which were committed against U.S. citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">We had something known as "fire cases.” </span><span class="sentence" id="514">These were our airmen who were brutally murdered when they were shot down. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">There were various categories of trials that were tried at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">But the true primary kinds were one that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> atrocity cases and those which were the special cases which involved not just camp personnel but a lot of the people on the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the Gestapo, the SS the SA, the Police organization, the paramilitary organizations who had committed atrocities against various allied prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Well, all those involving American citizens were tried there. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">All of the cases that were committed against inmates of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> within what we call the American Zone of Occupation, whether it be <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> or whether it be in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , were tried at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">That was the site of all the war crimes trials, other than the very few cases tried at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">See, only a total of 13 cases were tried at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">One of those was the original four power international trial involving Rudolf Hess and the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">The other 12 cases were what we called subsequent proceedings. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Excellent cases for trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">They had to be tried no matter how they were tried they had to be tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">There was no question about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">My only difference was to call them international or not international but either way they were well tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">So, those 13 cases were the only cases tried by American authority in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">The only other cases that were tried by American authority or personnel were at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="529">All of the cases involving atrocities committed in our zones of occupation, our zone of control. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">We brought them all there to try them. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And frequently we'd get someone from another <span class="REGION">zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">If I knew a name that was on a list in the Soviet Union who was not particularly wanted by them in the Soviet zone of occupation or the British or the French, then I could put in a request through our channels and ask for that person to be sent to us so that we would either try him or use him as a witness, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">The routine that was followed primarilly--So I have established now how we gained witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">These were primarily the inmates or the people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , depending on the category of the trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Then we have a <span class="DLF">line</span> up procedure, much like a <span class="DLF">police line</span> up in any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or any <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in which the inmates who are assigned to a particular category of geographical category say at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">They were camp personnel. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">They were guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">They were administrative personnel, whatever they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">They are now ina prison uniform of some sort and they're marched across a stage with a number around their heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">Sitting out in the audience are people who have been in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="541">This may involve several lineups, because people who come from various <span class="NPIP">places</span> may not be there at the same time, so you might have a similar lineup on the same people at different times before you conclude what you're going to do about the individuals that are wearing that number. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">So, with a piece of paper which has certain questions on it, kind of a questionnaire which will carry the name as put in my the prospective witness, the former inmate. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">He writes his name and the data about himself, where he can be reached and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Question one, do you recognize any one on the stage. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">If he answers yes, then he's going to have to go on from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">It it's no, then obviously he's not concerned with that lineup any further. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">If he answers yes, please identify him. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">It's so and so and so, number 3, number 17, number 19. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Where did you know them? </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I knew them at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Dachau</span> at such and such detail, maybe it's the medical detail or the slop detail or the concentration -- I don't remember, what did they call it -- the Brause, the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , really, detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And they've indicated where within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> they knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Now they're asked what the specific name is. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">They identify a name. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Now, obviously the next step that an investigator who's looked at this paper, if he finds any error in it, he knows that error has to be corrected or this is not going to be a good witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">What did this individual do? </span><span class="sentence" id="556">For example, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> case there were a lot of important elements of the Buchenwald case that were going to effect the whole history of the trials. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">One of them was the fact that Ilse Koch, the wife of the camp commandant had chosen individuals apparently for extermination based on the fact that she wanted to have a lampshade or bookcover out of a tattoo that the individual had. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">How to prove it? </span><span class="sentence" id="559">The positive evidence against her included on one case that she straddled a <span class="DLF">trench</span> where some prisoners were working and she urinated on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">When you consider the health conditions of those prisoners it could have been something that caused their death ultimately, and that she had hit one or some of them with a riding crop. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">That could cause the death of a very emaciated person, because they weren't getting much to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Actually they were getting virtually nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">So, that she could have caused the death of these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">It doesn't mean that she did, because there was no proof that she did, but that she hit them 1s uncontroverted. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">That she's there, that she's part of the system that is part of a conspiracy she could be tried on the common design element of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">All of these were provable cases against Ilse Koch. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Now, you get to the more serious charge of choosing someone for extermination so that she can have -- in other words we have a murder case against her. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">In any case, you got a murder case against her. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">You can say that under the common design "X" number of people are exterminated at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Dachau</span> and she's a part of the administration which caused that death. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">In my case, I would ask for a death penalty for her if I had tried her on those <span class="DLF">grounds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">But when you choose a <span class="DLF">path</span> to try to pressure in on the fact that the big crime that she committed 1s the lampshades the question is are you going to be able to prove your case and to prove it -- so some of these people who were in the lineup and saw her with a number now have said on their questionnaire her name is Ilse Koch. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">She was a camp commander's wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">She has done these things that I know of at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">So, Bill Denson and Bob Kunzo who are the trial counsel, very competent trial counsel in that particular case, had to take the evidence as presented to them by the investigators who were going over what had happened in the lineup procedure and who were sort of trying to farm out what was good and bad evidence were going to find when they went to trial that two things would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">One there had been a leak on the publicity on what we call raw materials. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">What does the witness really know? </span><span class="sentence" id="577">The witness said they knew that Ilse Koch had chosen these particular individuals for extermination for lampshade tattoos and bookcovers are now in evidence. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">So, what were the names of the prisoners who were exterminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Then you get down to the fine points of cross examination and they had some pretty good trial counsel, I take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And they were unable to properly identify who it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Joe, I don't know his last name, I don't know his number. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Where did Joe go? </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Well, the last time I saw him he was headed for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">I don't know where he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So you have a hard time identifying. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I do know that I recognize that tattoo. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I recognize that lampshade as having been his tattoo. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">But it's a loose kind of thing that troubles the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> , because they look at this evidence as being not quite tied up. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">There were some death penalties in that case. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Bill Denson if he's interrogated will be able to tell you who was and who wasn't executed as a result of his good prosecutor work. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">She got a relatively light sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">I think like 13 or 14 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">I was on Clay's staff in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> when her case came up for review there and Clay cut it way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And then she was turned over to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Clay was criticized for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">The lawyer who did the review was a very conscientious lawyer named Dick Higgins, Brigadier Major General, in fact, if he's still living, a reservist in the air corp. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Dick Higgin was on our staff at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> both in the trial branch and later in -- by the way he'd be a good person to interview if he's still living here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Later he was on the review staff at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> when I refused to go there, he went over. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Later he joined our staff in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> doing much of the same thing I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> except that he had the job of looking at all of the records of those that Clay wanted to go over to see whether or not on the petitions that were being presented to him they should have commutation of sentence or maybe even a pardon. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">In the case of Ilse Koch, Higgin said he couldn't find adequate, essentially I'm putting words in his mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">He may be living and deny this, but whatever he said to Clay he thought the sentence should be commuted to a lesser one because the evidence wasn't adequate. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">That essentially is what it added up to. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So, Clay commuted the sentence and she was turned over to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I don't know what happened to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I understand she got a little stiffer sentence in the <span class="BUILDING">German courts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">She was a bad one. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">But again, the evidence was weak there. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And I myself tried some of those lampshade and bookcover sort of cases, the tattoo things. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And it's awfully hard to make a case there. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I tried, myself I used to try bear down on what I thought was the more cogent part of the charges. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">If an individual is present in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as an integral part of the machinery that was putting hundreds of thousands of people to death, in that particular <span class="BUILDING">complex</span> or even thousands, you had a good murder charge against them. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">What difference does it make about lampshades. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">So, you could throw that in in passing, but don't bear down on that so that the defense leaps on it and says it has a lot of weak spots in it and they make a little impression on the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">The <span class="BUILDING">court</span> could not deny the fact that an individual who's in there pointing a billy club or a gun or a club at somebody and sending them down here and another step and another step and the next step the fellow's emaciated and he's being dragged by the heels down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and they take down the data and he's given a towel and a piece of soap and locked into the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Everybody in that <span class="DLF">pipeline</span> 1s guilty. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">You can't get around that fact, and that's the way I approached all of my cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">A lot of people got thrown off on what I call the glamour side of the trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">It looked better to talk about some of these specific things. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">For example some of them you could make a case more easily in the medical cases, the experimental cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">They had some crazy kinds of things that were done in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622">It's painful to me to think of these things, but anyhow, I recall there was one little sort of an operation type room was set up in the <span class="BUILDING">camp hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">They could hose it down after they blew a few brains out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">They'd bring people in as if they were going to take photographs of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Set them all up as if they were going to take their photograph, and then somebody behind them would just blow their brains out. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">You know, neither rhyme nor reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Maybe the person was a trouble maker in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">But there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to that kind of murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And they had experiments such as trying to freeze people to see whether or not they could recover by putting a couple of warm bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">They would take individuals and bring them down to the temperature of the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> , for example, presumably the thought was that some of the German airman or seaman who were thrown into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> one way or another there could survive if they were given a certain kind of treatment afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">So, they put a couple of girls in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with this body after this person after he reached a certain temperature or had been exposed to cold water for a certain period of time to see whether that would revive him. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Whether human body heat would revive him. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Any kind of experiment would seem to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And of course they had other kinds of experiments with medications and injections and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Mostly the damage was done by virtually working them to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">They reached a certain point of infirmity or they came in and they were of no use to the work program. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">When I think about it, my God why didn't -- if <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> wanted to use these people for the work program, or the sustenance, why didn't they feed them well. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Why didn't they treat them well. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Why not use them as free labor but try to save them. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Why kill off your free labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">That's a good thing to get rid of. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">It made no sense really. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">The SS were terrible people. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">They were terrible people. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And I doubt if Hitler was ever in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I think these people at the top level tried to save themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I wonder whether Imler was ever in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gering</span> , people who were accountable for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I have no evidence that they ever were, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">The final solution? </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Well, I doubt if they even looked at the refinements of the final solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">The language probably just meant that somebody else is taking care of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Like superior orders, it's the law, everybody relying on the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">That's why we had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">It was always somebody up there that he did it, not me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">QUESTION:  Were you present at these lineups? </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Did you see that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  No, everything that reached me was after the lineups. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I never -- they were still going on I'm sure, all the time, but no, I didn't bother with lineups. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">First of all I was trying to look at the material that came out of the <span class="DLF">line</span> up 1n a professional way. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">As to whether or not a case could be made. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">If there were weaknesses I would write a little memo as to what I thought were the weaknesses in it and pass it to someone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">They were either able to strengthen it with further evidence or maybe they wanted to try it that way they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I wouldn't try a case that I didn't think was prepared enough for trial.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="664">QUESTION:  Can you give us an example?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">ANSWER:  Well, the ones that I just talked about would be good examples. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">If a case came up -- no, really there's a couple of cases I defended simply because I realized they were not defensible and it was partly because I had a feeling with regard to the other counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">This doesn't make me look very good, but my friend Jim Phelps, with whom I really practiced law for a while in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Jim was part Indian. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I understood from people that knew him very well that he was Audi Murphy's C.O. That he was a captain, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">The time we knew him, he had just been discharged. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">He was a captain. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">He had apparently been a first lieutenant when he commanded troops at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anzio</span> , or the Italian campaign, and Audi Murphy with all those medals, the most decorated soldier had to go either forward to the Germans of course, do all these magnificent heroic things that he did, or go back to Jim Phelps. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I've always said, knowing Phelps it was a lot hell of a lot safer to go forward to the Germans than to come back to Jim Phelps. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">He was part Indian and he was mean, awfully mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">But we were friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Anyhow, Jim had a case and he had gotten lazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">He was an awfully good lawyer, and he had gotten lazy and there was one case that I had gotten familiar with. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I had looked at it and asked if I would take the defense on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Goodman was looking for someone to defend the case, and it looked like an open and shut case, as far as Phelps was concerned, and I guess as far as Goodman was concerned it seemed to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">But I did a little investigation on it and decided I was criticized later for not telling the administration that it shouldn't be tried, but I did try it. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">It was a farm lad who had apparently seen an airman descending, a U.S. airman descending, parachuted out of his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">The police chief there had apparently knew there was something going on <span class="NPIP">above</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> shot down so he had acerned about where it was going to come down. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">He got into his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , drove out to what was the <span class="REGION">area</span> and saw this farm lad standing there with a great big fence post in his hand, kind of like a tree limb. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And he was oddly turning his head from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">The airman was dead on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> with his head all caved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And he said the ghost made me do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">That was what he said and this was made a matter of the official record by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So, the police chief took the lad back and took a statement from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Now, that's all the evidence that the government had. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Phelps presented the evidence, strutted around a little bit, try to top that one if you will and I said, "Chief have you known this accused?" </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I knew in advance what was going to do it. "</span><span class="sentence" id="693">Have you known this accused for a long period of time?" </span><span class="sentence" id="694">He said, "I've known him all of his life.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="695">As a matter of fact, did you have any kind of fiduciary relationship with him, that is were you not his guardian?" </span><span class="sentence" id="696">He said, "Yes, I had been his guardian.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="697">How did that happen?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="698">His family was dead and he couldn't get into service. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">He was kind of a dull kind of individual and he seemed to be kind of harmless.” </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I said, "Well this is not a harmless thing that's done here. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">He's confessed to a crime here, has he not to murder?" </span><span class="sentence" id="702">He said, "Yes, but he never committed a murder.” </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I said, "Well, why would you say that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="704">He said, "Well, it wasn't unusual for him to confess to a crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">He confessed to all the crimes that were ever committed in the community.” </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And I said, "did he commit any of those crimes?" </span><span class="sentence" id="707">He said, "No, he never committed any of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">He was really rather harmless sort of fellow.” </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I said, "Well this is not a harmless act, chief. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Let me ask you this. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Did you see that airman as he was descending.” </span><span class="sentence" id="712">He said, "Yes, I did.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="713">Would you tell the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> about what level his parachute opened?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="714">Oh" he said, "it never opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">He landed on his head.” </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Well, of course that blew the case out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , and the President of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> criticized both Phelps and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Phelps for not preparing the case better and me for not telling the administration which paid my salary. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">That was mischievous. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Obviously that case should not have been tried and I shouldn't have done what I did, and Phelps should have done a better job, but other than that, and I tried that Lotterbaucher case. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I did that out of mischief as well, but I didn't like the lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I'm not proud of that, but that's what that was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">QUESTION:  Would you describe the Lotterbaucher case?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">ANSWER:  Well, I was --tensions were very high. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">We were trying to wrap up all this work at the end of the war crime. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">We were told to close the program down by the first of January, I believe it was of 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And so I had cases really stacked up along side my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> , and I was using my own rule of thumb. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">If there were not 10,000 deaths asserted in the indictments that were going to be drafted to be attached to the case, I figured well, put it on the bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Keep rotating it down so that those with the larger numbers could be referred to trial and recommend this is ready for trial, this one is ready trial, this one 1s not because the evidence is not sufficient and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Obviously the ones with even one death that is provable is ready for trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So, some of them, because of the nature, the horror of the nature of the particular case could be referred to trial such as, well I suppose Phelps felt that one was horrible enough because of the manner of the killing of the American airman with a club over the fence post. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I'm not sure whether that's a case that he referred to trial himself or somebody else had, anyhow he had it at trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">He had options just as all of us had who were chief trial counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">He probably was doing much the same sort of thing as I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Here's a stack of cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">On one occasion then while I'm in the midst of very serious work and I've got all my own problems I'm thinking about anyhow, one of the lawyers there was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , a major, a Bigelow Boison. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And Boison was sort of a mystery character in the war crimes program. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">It was known that he had been there pretty much from he beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">He was working on one case. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">He seemed to be single minded about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">He didn't seem to want to work with anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">He didn't want to work on any other cases, and he was left pretty much to himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So, on this particular occasion, he was not a likeable individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">He stuck his head in the <span class="DLF">door</span> of my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and he said, "Donihi, you're going to be my assistant in the Lotterbaucher case.” </span><span class="sentence" id="744">And I said, "Two questions: Who the hell is Lotterbaucher and who said so?" </span><span class="sentence" id="745">After all, I knew I was a chief trial counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I didn't know what he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I just knew he was a member -- I didn't even know whether he was even a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">He was a member of the Judge Advocates General staff which I suppose qualified him in military law. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">But I don't know whether he was a counsel lawyer or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And so he said, "Lottenbaucher is the person who was secretly selected to succeed Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">That's who he is and Leo Goodman if you must know said.” </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Well Goodman was my boss and Leo was his boss, so I went down to see Leo and I said, "Why have you done this to me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And he said, "I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">He asked whether he could have you to assist him, and I said if it's all right with Donihi, it's all right with me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I said, "In that case, would you please permit me to defend the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I don't like him" and I didn't know Lottenbaucher from Johan Schmidt at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">As I got into the Lotterbaucher case I could see where Boison was sort of hanging himself rather than Lotterbaugher and I was really permitting him to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And it offered an opportunity I could also see to properly dispute the evidence that he wanted to present about the selection of Lotterbaucher, I had to have some testimony from Nazis, high ranking Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">So as Lotterbaucher had worked as the Deputy Chief of the Hitler Youth under Alder Von Shurock who had been tried at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> in the original case, Von Schirach was the head of the Hitler Youth, Von Schirach had then gone from that job to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> as the Gauleiter of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , the Gauleiter of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Hitler chose individuals to head large political areas. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">He had gerrymandered <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> into various Gaus, states if you like, and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was considered to be a Gau, as was <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and so forth, and each one of them had a gauwlighter placed in charge of them as they were put under German command. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">So, in the case of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , this particular chap that was head of the Hitler Youth and gotten the job and as his deputy Lottenbaucher moved up into the number 2 position as the head of the Hitler Youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Now, Lotterbaucher then was chosen later and it had to be by a personal choice of Hitler, because he personally chose all the gaulighters, he was chosen to head the Gau of which was a large industrial, very important <span class="REGION">industrial area</span> , and he became also the president of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">A very important job actually, and really I think any lawyer worth his salt would try Lottenbaucher with ease if he had properly tried the case would have gotten a death penalty. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Not that there's anything to be bragged about in getting a death penalty, but I think probably all these fellows deserved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Anyhow, now I'm going to be defending him and the weakness in the evidentiary link was whether or not we were going to be able to counter the evidence which is coming from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And Telford Taylor had written a letter, sort of a safe passage for one -- see if I can even think of his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">He's written several books since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">He was a very hard person to like in a <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="770">As a witness he would turn the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> against himself more than towards himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Under my cross examination he admitted, I wish I could think of his name right now, he admitted that he considered himself to be the father of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camp</span> and the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Now, imagine the defense bringing in that kind of a character in this kind of a case to finger out Lotterbaucher who had a much lesser position. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">This chap had married Goering's niece, according to his own testimony in order to save his own neck, he says. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">Well, he's in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">Herman Goering factories</span> , a tremendous job using slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">He was a bad one. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">He should have been on trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">But for some reason he had been granted immunity by Taylor probably because he was offering enough evidence against others. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And so now here he 1s offering evidence in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and that was his primary testimony. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Well, of course, Rudolf Hess and who's the other one, I can't think of his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">My memory fades a little bit at times. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">They were the top ranking a higher rank in the seniority of things within in the German hierarchy than was this particular witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">So, I felt that their testimony would be important. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I had no idea that I'd be able to get in, but I sent a message to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> asking permission to interrogate them and both of them had been convicted at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and were incarcerated at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="784">It's a <span class="BUILDING">four power prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="785">In order to get there you'd have to get the permission of the Russians, the British, the French as well as the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="786">My avenues of approach had to be through the American mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">I'll call him mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">We had four <span class="REGION">military districts</span> and the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was quartered with the British and the French and the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and Russians, each in charge of one of those, we called them sectors. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">But the four they were commanders of the American well not quite a concern, the <span class="REGION">American sector</span> , and each one had his own command and they came together in what's known as the commanditoria. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Together they represented one mayor. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">They were the mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> jointly. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Of course they had a water system, a telephone system, all of these things, light system, all of these things that involved running a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , had to be coordinated amongst the four of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">In order to get to see Rudolf Hess I had to ask,"Will you let me in?" </span><span class="sentence" id="794">My request came through the American representative, Frank Howley, who is generally known as a man who wanted to go to war against the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">He used to be called "Howling Mad Howley". </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Now, he never said he wanted to go to war against the Russians, but what he did say that got a lot of publicity is "Let's run the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> down the <span class="DLF">Autobahn</span> and put a stop to this nonsense" the <span class="DLF">blockades</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Clay was on his way- Clay of course had seniority in the sense of the overall international picture, but Clay was on his way to report to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> when my request arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and Clay was apparently going to be there for several days and Howley saw this as an opportunity to try to get the <span class="DLF">gates</span> open at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> for historians and scholars. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">He had no idea who I was and didn't certainly know that I was going to be coming for the defense. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">He just knew that I had a title that came out of the American government. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">So, he jumped on that and decided that this would be a good opportunity to get the <span class="DLF">gates</span> of pride open into the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> for some of our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">In order to accomplish that he would have to put a request on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and ask the Russians, the British and the French to consider it favorably, within 48 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">It had to lay there for 48 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Now, the last day of business would be Friday. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">He decided to wait until Friday, 10:00 in the morning, thereabouts, put it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="805">It would have to lay there for 48 hours which would be Sunday morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Then, tell me as he did to arrive at the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> at 10:00 on Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">They hadn't even considered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">They merely have got it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in the commandatoria with a 48 hour rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Now, obviously anyone would know right away that this would be a device and I knew it was going to be a device, but I was following instructions, I wanted to get in that <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And of course there was no trouble getting in under the circumstances but talking to the accused was another thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I should say the convicted, the convicts. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">Hess was in a very large <span class="INT_SPACE">cage</span> , much like an animal cage if you can imagine a lion's cage at the circus, as was Von Schirach, the Hitler Youth leader was in another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> were lined up on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> for all of the four powers representatives, for myself, my interpreter, and court reporter. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">It was a great temptation. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I wanted to get over and start talking to them immediately but I was told by each of three who were there the American, French, and British that their instructions were no, you can't do it unless the Russians show because we don't want a break on this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And the Russians have said no, so I said well, could you get the Russian on the telephone for me and I told him that I was unable to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">I told him the truth about that that I had to do it now or never. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And he said well, he was very apologetic, he understood my <span class="NPIP">place</span> but it would have to be taken up tomorrow, Monday, that I think he said but we don't particularly honor Sunday as you do, but that's out of consideration for the other powers rather than ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">We don't feel that the 48 hour rule has ever meant to circumvent the good orderly approach to consideration of business. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I had to agree that that sounded pretty reasonable to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">I said, "I'm here and I have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">They're over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I'm looking at them right now and as soon as I hang up this telephone.” </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Here I lied to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">I said I'm going to start these interrogations but I feel that I have to apologize to you and to your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> because I don't want anyone to feel embarrassed by this but I have to do it now or never, but I do feel that I owe it to you to tell you that one of the subjects I'm going to get into is communism on Hitler's staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">He was there almost that fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Well, he was in a bind. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I sort of calculated that he'd come. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Obviously I knew that that would peak his interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">He had to answer to something if that happened and I went out of there and said that these two inmates have now identified communist on Hitler's staff, 1t would have made news. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">There's no question about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">So, he was there to see what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">It wasn't the subject at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I had no intention of getting into that because I'm not qualified to get into it at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">But we did go through the whole thing and we had a little drink and they have a tiny club there at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spendell</span> or did have and we all had a little drink and toasted one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I understood then the next day then the Russians really created quite a ruckus and <span class="NPIP">hell</span> broke lose in the commandatora. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">They never were able to get anyone in again. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">Whether they could have except for that I don't know, probably not. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Now, I mentioned Dick Higgin. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">Dick Higgin among his other jobs later, on the State Department's staff. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">He became the <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> 's officer after we reopened our <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> there, and as such he had to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Spandau</span> and make constant reports about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">He told me that he never could talk to Hess except Hess would say "What do you think of my <span class="DLF">garden</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="843">It was a lot of rocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">Hess was just pulling his leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Hess wouldn't talk to anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="846">QUESTION:  What was it like to talk to him? </span><span class="sentence" id="847">What did you ask him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">ANSWER:  Well, Hess was my total subject matter had to with why I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">Whether or not Lottenbaucher was a high enough member of the Hitler team to have been even considered remotely as a successor to Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Von Schirach, the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">The testimony of Von Schirach was somewhat helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I did put that in evidence as having some sense in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Also, by reputation Von Schirach had an American Mother and I think maybe the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> thought he was more believable than if he didn't have any American blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">It wouldn't make sense, but I believe that could have had something to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">Hess, however, his document was pretty much -- he was trying to be cooperate when he found out I was there for the defense. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">But he was pretty much giving me a Self-serving declaration. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">He was trying to make his own distorted views known. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">He wanted to make a complaint against <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">So, I didn't want to put it in evidence because I didn't think it served my ace very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I did offer it to Boisen and Boisen looked at it distinctly and he didn't want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">So, I still have the original interrogation, otherwise it would have been in evidence just as Von Schirach's was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">QUESTION:  What had Von Schirach done?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="864">ANSWER:  On the essentials they both said, they didn't know about any secret meeting that would have considered Lotterbaucher. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">They didn't think that was possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">That was the essential thing, as far as I was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">That's all I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> for at that particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">And whether the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> was influenced by that as much as it was against the witness who was brought in by Boisen, I think my cross examination of that witness was very telling because he admitted to being the father of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camp</span> and the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And you could see the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> immediately, he ought to be hung right here in the <span class="BUILDING">courtroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And he had one of these large fencing scarves on his face. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">Apparently he was one of that club of I'm trying to think, the military clique where they used to bandage their faces up and then they'd hit with a sabre. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">You've seen those scarves, I'm sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">I'm trying to think of his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">It may come back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">Right now it doesn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Anyhow, have I departed from the general subject around here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="877">QUESTION:  What was the disposition of that case? </span><span class="sentence" id="878">You won that case?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">ANSWER:  There were a great many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">I guess you would have to say it was a total victory in some ways because there should have been a lot, put it this way, and I don't mean to be boastful about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I think any lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> could have prosecuted that case, any of the chief trial counsel could have prosecuted that case and had a number of hangings including Lottenbaucher's. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Lottenbaucher went scott free. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">The Kreisleiter of the particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where some of the deaths occurred some of the deaths and that were ascribed to leadership because of what was known as a Borman (ph) order to dispose of American airman. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">The Americans were supposed to be recruited in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> to be airman and that Borman (ph) order was making a point of the bestiality of the kind of people we were dealing with. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Anyhow there was a lot of the proof that was adduced by Boisen was to try to carry out the influence of the so-called Borman (ph) order, the treatment of flyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Normally the Kreisleiter through whom this order would have emanated from the Gestapo and the SS, the Kreisleiter would have been hanged for sure, by a fellow by the name of Peiffer and he only got -- he got life imprisonment but he didn't get death, and of course that means he's out now someplace if he lived through his imprisonment, and all the others with lesser sentences. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">The only one that went free as far as I know is Lottenbaucher. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">He was keynote in the trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">He should have -- I was relying more on Boison's failure than I was on any talent of my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">Every day at the end of the trial, I've forgotten how long that case went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">It may have been a couple of weeks, but anyhow I'd go up to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and pick up the notes that were left by the Judges. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">This is an old trick in these things anyhow, and then I'd knew pretty much how the judges were feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I lived in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="894">At that point I had moved out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as I was so depressed living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> that I finally asked permission to live in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> that was reserved for the <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> and they had a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that they let me have there and I knew these judges very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">They were mostly pretty good solid military men and they made good judges as a general thing, but they were very prejudiced I'm sure against Boisen in this particular case, and they may have been prejudiced towards me out of friendship, although I think that probably would have been a minor part. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">But I picked up these notes and a lot of them would say "Why doesn't Donihi pin back Boisen's ears.” </span><span class="sentence" id="897">Well of course the court member didn't realize that I was waiting for them to do the pinning back. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">It's an old defense ploy, but it gave me a quick readout as to how their minds were running at the end of every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And Boisen had a habit if sticking his finger up in the faces of the <span class="BUILDING">court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">He get up right close to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bench</span> and he would just sort of waive his finger and you could see the expression on their faces you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">They wanted to clip him, and he was a major, now if he had been a civilian perhaps they might have accepted it better. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">He was a major and they were colonels all the way down the <span class="DLF">line</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">QUESTION:  Give me an idea of the kinds of cases that would come across your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lawyer's desks</span> that you would review and decide to do the case or not to do the case and which cases did you want to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="904">ANSWER:  Well, I made reference earlier to the Schindler matter, and I had a similar case to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> there was the prisoners called it the Wuelfert detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">W-U-E-L-F-E-R-T detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">There were two, I think they were brothers-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="908"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wuelfert</span> was the name of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , but the two man who ran it had a canning, <span class="BUILDING">meat canning factory</span> , a very large, let's say like Armand Hammer or Hormel or something of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">They had made literally millions and millions of dollars out of the slave labor they had working there from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Everyone in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> wanted to get into the Wuelfert detail because they were treated so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">They had a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to rest and sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">They stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">They didn't return to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , except for some grave infraction they were never taken off that detail. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">They were there until the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">They were well fed, well treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">So in a matter there was a similarity to Schindler here. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">But as I looked at the case, nobody seemed to want to try that case that lawyers are sort of picking and choosing what they wanted to try which I guess was a fair way to do it because they do their better work that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And no one seemed to want that one and I decided I would try it myself, because to my way of thinking, I didn't care how good they were to the prisoners, it's the fact that they were getting rich on these prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">Of course, I think if all of the Germans who were using slave labor treated them as Wuelfert did, perhaps it would have been for a better end of the war and maybe we wouldn't have had a war crimes program of the same dimensions. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Schindler and Wuelfert were similar in this regard. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Anyhow, I tried them and I remember Claudio Delatallo and Claudio had an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belsano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Claudio is he in college days had roomed in <span class="BUILDING">University of Belsano</span> I believe it was had roomed with Tagliati who was the head of the Italian Communist Party, who subsequently became the head of the Italian Communist party. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I don't know whether that says that Claudio is involved in communism or not, but he refused, Claudio refused to, some others lawyers did too, to prosecute any of the cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">The lawyers were expected generally to be on call to either prosecute or defend. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">The cases that I defended sometimes I didn't want to defend, but they had to be defended. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">I thought you go ahead an do your job on tt. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Sometimes I'd turn it down if I absolutely refused to I would be permitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">But it was considered bad taste not to defend a case if you were asked to. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And somebody had to be there in the defense. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">It was part of the regulation. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">But Claudio refused to take any for the prosecution, and that was permissive. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And he prosecuted no cases and he defended a lot of them and he was defensive of the whole system in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Anyhow, Claudio complained to our mutual boss Leo Goodman. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">He used to say that this Donihi he is vicious, he is vicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">I never thought I was vicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">It's just that I tried to try my cases in a workmanlike manner. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And sometimes I'd try to put the lawyer on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> on trial, that's sort of an old ploy in <span class="BUILDING">trial court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Anyhow, this particular case of the Wuelfert's, Claudio was feeling that very strongly because he was sympathetic with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">The Wuelferts I forgotten the term of years, maybe four, five, six or seven, it doesn't have much meaning at this point as to the time, 1t was relatively short sentence, and I guess I was asking for the death penalty as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">I had very strong feelings that if you're part of the system using slave labor why, you know you can't fall back on the business that I was nice to the prisoners any more than you could say it was superior orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">In fact, it's worse that superior orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">They guy's that saying superior orders 1s saying I was forced to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">This guy 1s doing it because he's making money. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And if you were there and listening to the various stories about these things that prisoners were required to do and a lot of them died if they were working in the <span class="DLF">rock quarries</span> , they might die. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">If they tried to make an escape, the dogs would be sent after them. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">They might be torn to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">Some of them were beaten to death for trying to raid the garbages from the SS men's kitchen, that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">It was just unbelievable sort of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">There were so many people there that I suppose the SS figured a few more less isn't going to make that difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">They were nearly dead, you hit a guy and he drops over, he can't recover.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">QUESTION:  In the course of the trial, did you rely more on witnesses or on documents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="952">ANSWER:  Well, documents were of course the mainstay of the membership in an organization which was considered to be, had been held to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="953">The original <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> trial had held to be infamous and unlawful organizations, criminal organizations, and all you had to have was that document showing the membership and the organizational the indictment against the organization itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">You could rest on that, but usually you wanted to have a little bit more. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">You wanted to know something about their particular participation, maybe he was the president of the organization or I should say the Fuhrer, the local Fuhrer of the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">By the way, I meant to say about Hess. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">It was interesting to me that the tenure of Hess's comments and you have more than just reading of the testimony itself, you have to almost hear the inflection in his voice, and he spoke with such fondness of the Fuhrer. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">It sounded like he still was hoping for a comeback. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">I don't think he expected the Fuhrer to come back, but I think he did think that maybe Nazism would.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="960">QUESTION:  When you couldn't rely on documents, and you needed to rely on witness was that --?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">ANSWER:  Well, you really didn't have to rely totally on -- you always had a common design to fall back on. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">If a person occupied a position 1n a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , or in the Gestapo or the SS or the SA, obviously that was adequate. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">You had enough to start with there. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">In the case such as the one with the young farmer that was beating someone with a fence post, you had to have specific evidence because that was related to a specific event. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Somebody had to know what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Phelps thought he had enough evidence in the sworn testimony with the kid that said that the Ghost made him cave in the head of the airman. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Well, it wasn't enough as it turned out, but normally it should have been.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">QUESTION:  Did the cases that came across your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> not of parties members but of people who were hired by the system but who were not necessarily party members you wouldn't have that level of documentation? </span><span class="sentence" id="969">They were---
ANSWER:  No, if I understand that question correctly, whether they were party members or not, you know we're dealing mostly with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and obviously a lot of people in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> who are prisoners were not party members, a lot of them might have been prisoners who should have been tried themselves as habitual criminals, murderers possibly who are in there doing the bidding of the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">We call them Kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">The Kapos, people who wanted at the cost of the lives of others, maybe I'm being too harsh on them but anyhow, people who were willing to do the bidding of the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">Frequently you'd hear of the SS people were interrogating the SS people. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">You would hear them say something like if there were any deaths or if there were any killings the prisoners themselves must have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Well, the truth is, is that the SS wanted to let the fault for that fall as much on the prisoner command as they could, the Kapo command, you could call it that. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">But there's no escaping the fact that it was the SS really. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">There was no way that the Kapo command was not running the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but they were doing an awful lot of the chores. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Just like a trustee in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Now, if that's the kind of person that you are referring to when you asked if a person who is not a party member, generally speaking, everybody in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was some kind of a party member. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">If you applied for -- first of all, if you joined the Hitler youth, no matter what your age, you're kind of a party member right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">If you applied for a driver's license, you've joined the automobile club, you were kind of a party member. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">You couldn't get the sustenance that it took to keep life going unless you were in some kind of a party structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="982">QUESTION:  Maybe I should put the question another way. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> trials that you were involved in, they were not trying people for being members of an institution that committed atrocities but you were mainly trying people who did things were not simply in some formal way a member of a system that committed atrocities, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Because the trials were a particular act, or am I wrong?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="985">ANSWER:  Well, anyone who is an SS person or an administrative personnel within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , was automatically going to be tried because he was a member of a common design there. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">Anyone who had a position such as a Kreisleiter, we'll say a mayor, we'll say a Gauleiter, a governor, head of the Hitler Youth, anyone who came across say any of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desks</span> with that kind of category, was categorically in a criminal organization and therefore, was subject to trial for the criminal acts of that organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">If you wanted to be more specific about what his particular role was then you dug deeper, but he could have been tried on the common design theory alone, if you wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Lawyers were reluctant to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I did that with regard to the Wuelfert case simply because I felt like don't let them get off simply because they were being nice to prisoners and letting them eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">What you're saying in a situation like that is Oh we let them live. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">We let them sleep on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> where it was nice and warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">You could hardly call that kindness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="993">QUESTION:  So, the witnesses if you were going to go deeper, not through documentation but through eyewitness testimony, you would find witnesses of that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="994">You wouldn't use generic witnesses about what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in general?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="995">ANSWER:  Well everybody who came to a lineup of course was -- I see what you're saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">In general well you could use an expert witness of course, if you wanted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">I never did rely on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">I used specific witnesses with specific <span class="DLF">fences</span> or specific conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">To that extent you might be using someone generically who could testify as to the conditions of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or several <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but you really didn't need expert witnesses on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">There was much, it was so easily provable with what you had at hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I'm not sure maybe if we had used experts as you suggest, maybe you could have shortened the length of some of the trials down to maybe a day or two instead of several days and trying to prove specific things, but that was not my practice anyhow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1002">QUESTION:  At a certain point, this is right after the Lottenbaucher trial, I gather, they were saying to close down the cases?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1003">ANSWER:  Yes, shortly after that towards the end of 1947.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1004">QUESTION:  Did you find that, did you have files on your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1005">ANSWER:  I had a lot of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">A lot of that had to be turned over to -- we couldn't possible try all the cases that were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">That's why we were trying hysterically to get the most important things out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">Important in terms of the maximum number of deaths. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">The gravest offenses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Those things which we felt should be given a priority in trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">It wasn't at all possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">So, I guess whatever was left over went to the Germans for trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">I sort of washed my hands of the whole event, because I didn't go with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> with the rest of the team who took on the job of reviews, but then I went up to Clay's staff as I've just indicated, and that removed me totally from war crimes for the time being. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">End of Tape #2 Tape #3
QUESTION:  Can you just tell us briefly how you were recruited for the European Theater of War Crimes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1015">ANSWER:  I think the first time was when I came back after being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tokyo</span> and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on emergency, I was asked at the <span class="BUILDING">Pentagon</span> -- I had to make some reports for Mr. Keenan, the Chief Counsel, and I was asked if I would consider taking a job in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">I think the feeling was that maybe I would be able to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and get back and forth <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">Everyone knew that I had had this emergency. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">But I sort of tucked in my back pocket for future consideration, and then I was asked again after I had resigned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">That was several months later, and I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and thought about it and then I called them and said yes, I would take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">It was that simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">I got orders to report that they've given time to the <span class="BUILDING">court of departation</span> , I guess they called it, the fourth of December 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">I was there and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">It was terribly cold when I arrived and went from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">It was just a hop skip and jump and then I went to work immediately after the first of the year trying cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">I tried cases all of 1946 and 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">I guess there was two years of trial work, quite a few cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1027">QUESTION:  About how many?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1028">ANSWER:  Ok, I guess if I were to count the ones that passed across the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> for someone else to try that I was just looking for trial, I would have to say probably close to a thousand cases that went through my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">And I was in <span class="BUILDING">court</span> almost every day of the five days of the week trying some part of some case, so you could figure that five days a week, not necessarily a different case each day, but if you were to count it that way that would be 20 cases a month that I myself would be trying which would add up pretty close to 200, maybe in the neighborhood of 200 cases a year, or 500 cases that I personally probably tried, or was part of a trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">I wasn't necessarily the lawyer because a lot of these cases had several lawyers in them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">On the <span class="REGION">prosecution side</span> you would have several lawyers for one reason or another, break down the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">On the <span class="REGION">defense side</span> frequently you would have conflicting testimony, conflicting interest so that they had to have different defense counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">Each accused was entitled to his own counsel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">If it in any way conflicted with the trial of the others on trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">There's -- you know I'm just one of several lawyers that was trying cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">I think Phil Denson who was there before I was probably tried more significant cases than I. Certainly the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> case was more significant public relations wise and it was the original -- I tried several Buchenwald cases, but they were sort of subsequent, the wrap up of the administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">He got the top people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in whatever cases he tried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Bill would know more about the original conception of those trials over there than I would. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">I think he was there from 1945 on, whereas I came from <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , Johnny come lately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1040">QUESTION:  How did it come about that people were able to say, "I will not defend anybody?"</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1041">ANSWER:  I guess there were three people, if I'm not mistaken, Joe Frisky who is close to the <span class="REGION">upper peninsula</span> in <span class="REGION">Michigan</span> , not quite that far north, but he was a judge up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">He was a very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">I think he's one of those who preferred just to defend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">I think partly it's out of a habit pattern of being a defense lawyer much of their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">I mentioned Claudio Dellatalla. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">I don't know why Claudio did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Claudio would sit in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> full of people, and I think a part of 1t was just mischievous because if he wanted to start almost a riotous conversation, he'd say well one of these days they're going to erect a statue out here of Hitler and part of it's going to be because he had the right idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">Oh my Lord, the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> would divide right down the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">People were ready to throw rocks not only at him but at each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">He could start a lot of arguments that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">So, you have to draw some conclusion from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">Maybe he was anti-semitic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">It seemed so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Maybe it was just mischief. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">I can't imagine, but he was one of those that only defended. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Frisky only defended. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">I'm sure the motivations were not the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">Don Ross, a Navy captain, I don't remember him prosecuting any cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">He seemed to prefer defending, but I think in the case of Frisky and Ross, I think they probably had experience in defending cases more than in prosecution, and I must say, the prosecution of the cases to a trial lawyer in a setting like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> is not any challenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">The challenge to a lawyer sometimes means a great deal, and I think probably those who are prosecuting cases must have had the experience that this 1s sort of spearing fish in a barrel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">I defended some cases out of a sort of a feeling that you have a duty as a lawyer not to just prosecute all of them, and I defended some cases that I would have rather have prosecuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">I mean personally would have rather prosecuted because of my distaste for the deeds that were really provable in the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1063">QUESTION:  Were there lawyers who refused to defend anybody?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1064">ANSWER:  Yes, I think many of the Jewish lawyers did, and quite understandably. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">They had such a feeling of antipathy in that setting, gosh, how can you possibly be fair and impartial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">Fair is one thing, impartial how can you be impartial if you have relative and friends neighbors who have been affected by these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in an adverse way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">So, I can understand why they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">I knew several of the lawyers there who absolutely would not take on a defensive case.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1069">QUESTION:  Can we talk a little bit about witnesses and was it difficult using survivors as witnesses given the trauma that they had just gone through?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1070">ANSWER:  Yes, 1t was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I recommend that is a good tea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">I remember seeing, this hardly enlightens, but, an image comes to my mind of Churchill on one occassion when he was addressing a joint session of the Parliment and he had a suprised look on his face as he picked up what he thought was a glass of water. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1073">This is really tea." </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">But-- There were so many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">They came into your <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">You got their names, you asked to speak with them because you know that they're witnesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">They've been through a line up procedure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">And you kind of feel that 1n my situation, here it is a couple of years after they have been released from that terrible <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">encampment,</span> you kind of expect they're going to come in looking fairly healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And they come in and they're still emaciated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">They're trembling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">They've lost teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">Their memory seems to lapse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">Their eyes show various kinds of distress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">You talk to people like this day after day, it's not long before you begin to feel a little bit like them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">It's a terrible sensation, really to realize -- I guess I could illustrate this because none of us could possibly know exactly what it's like to be in one of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> any more than we could unless we've been in battle we couldn't know what it's like to be shot in a battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">I guess it was Easter of 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">Three of us went down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> together, and we found that our money was rapidly running out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">The <span class="BUILDING">Black Market</span> prices were just out of this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">If you went into a <span class="BUILDING">French nightclub</span> some waiter had put a 10,000 frank bottle of champagne on your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and uncorked it before you even had a chance to say I don't want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">It seemed like everyone was grabbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">There were a few things that were frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092"><span class="INT_SPACE">Hotel rooms</span> were frozen in the war time price freeze. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">Transportation other things -- so we decided that we just couldn't afford the life that was supposed to be a Parisian gay life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">We better get back to work, and I checked with <span class="BUILDING">Horley Airport</span> to find out how we could go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> by <span class="DLF">air</span> without spending too much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">I found out that they had a war time price freeze on air travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">It was very inexpensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">We were going to be able to fly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> for less I guess than it had cost us to come down by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , so we decided we would do that and we could exchange our French francs such as they were or on a one to one basis for Algerian francs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">And then at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> for Tunisian francs and then we'd be on our own getting Roman or getting Italian lira. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Well, we had some difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">We got as far as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> on the first leg of the journey and we're going through immigration and the chap who was checking us told me over and over again you can't go because you don't have a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And I kept handing him my passport saying but I have a diplomatic passport. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">You have no visa, which he was talking French, and I don't know much French, anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">I had pushed by b-4 bag back at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">These other two people with me were looking kind of uncomfortable as though they were willing to turn around and go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">I kept pushing my bag towards him because he picked the bags up and moved them over where they go up a <span class="DLF">ramp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">Finally in some disgust, I guess he figured let them learn for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">He took my bag and he pushed it over and he just waived us on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">So, we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> , got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> and to our amusement and misfortune we found that the immigration Frenchman there was excellent in English and he said, I am awfully sorry, you cannot come into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> without a visa, an admission. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">I said, "Well, we won't be any trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Just let us-- we'll make our reservation back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> on the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">He said, "I'm awfully sorry, but you cannot leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> without a visa, an exit visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">So, I said, what are we going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And he said, well where are you headed what are you going to do and one thing and another and I said we were with the war crimes program. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">It seemed to impress him, and it was true that I was going to try a case when I went back involving the death of some 10,000 Frenchmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">So, I was able to tell him truthfully that from the French point of view it was important for me to get back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">So, he called a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and we got what they claimed was <span class="INT_SPACE">Eisenhower's suite</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">It was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">We learned it was very little cost, very lost cost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">And the same bottle of champagne, for example, that would have been 10,000 francs was something closer to 100 francs in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">It was crazy this difference in prices. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">So, we felt rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">We were having a great time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">We were told that we'd have to see their <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> and our own <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> on Monday, which we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">We there on the weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">So, after enjoying a few days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> , I-- foolishly -- I did it without checking things that needed to be checked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">I made reservations by rail after I had gotten our visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">I had gotten visas for us to leave by way of, I don't know whether it was Mason Blanc Air (ph), but anyhow, an <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> , and that's stamped in the passport that we're going to need the visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">Well, we got onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">We couldn't get transportation out by <span class="DLF">air</span> so we got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and dumped out on the dessert -- we had <span class="INT_SPACE">state rooms</span> , -- dumped out on the dessert when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> turned south and we were stranded waiting for the next one to come along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">It was horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was packed with Arabs and kids that were noisy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">We waited several hours out there on a little <span class="DLF">platform</span> in the middle of the dessert with little bonfires going around, it looked like tribal bonfires. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">It was not exactly an exciting scene, and then when we got to the <span class="DLF">border</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span> , I was taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and told that we were not permitted to go through on the visa because it said we were going to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> by <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">What do you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">I was trying to tell them in French that I was involved with the criminals--the war criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">They got the wrong impression from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">They thought maybe I was an escaped war criminal and giving us a very hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">We finally got an English interpreter who explained to them that I was a prosecutor that there were 10,000 Frenchman involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">So, the chap called the chief of police in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunis</span> , got authority for us to come through, back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and the chief of police met us in his own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">Enough of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">I'm going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">That first night in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> we were having dinner and the desk clerk came in and said, there's a gentleman here who wants to speak with you, and I thought right away maybe the police are here because of the way we came in without visas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">It turned out to be a gentleman who was in the high -- boots of a field engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">He was a civil engineer in the engineering trousers suit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">He had the dress of his profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">Invited him to have coffee and dessert with us and he was very belligerent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">He said you owe me some money and I said you know what money do I owe you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">He explained that he and his wife were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">That when they were released at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> they agreed between themselves they would never again speak of the terrible things that they've been through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">They were going back to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">They did apparently went back, I think it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">They went back there and still the surroundings were constant reminders of the Nazi occupation and the things that had happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">So, he apparently obtained work and they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> , he said they succeeded in not ever talking about it again, but two letters came, one to him and one to his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">The kind of letters that we sent out to the survivors asking them to come back and go through this lineup procedure, give testimony, stay and identify and be part of the whole trial procedure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">So, he said they took these letters and they sat down and they cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">He and his wife both sat there and cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">It was pathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">If you looked at this man you knew how serious he was, and that they decided that they did have a duty, one of them would go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">He was the one who was going to go, so he immediately went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">He paid his own way back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Dachau hotel</span> , automobile rental, all his food, he paid for and he said and nobody has ever reimbursed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">It seems to me to be very obvious because obviously the U.S. Army is really running that operation and you'd have to have travel orders to travel on and with these orders you would get your meals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">You would get everything in the routines that are provided by the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">I'll tell you what. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">I'll take the facts down as you give them to me and present them back to our finance officer and then he may be in touch with you and you can work it out between yourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">He was very grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">He said let me come back and take you all to my <span class="BUILDING">night club</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">Well, we wanted to see some of the <span class="BUILDING">nightclubs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">He took us out on the <span class="REGION">Gold Coast</span> and we went to three <span class="BUILDING">clubs</span> , and these things were posh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">You know, the sort of thing you'd expect to find in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Las Vegas</span> and he threw away an awful lot more money on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">roulette tables</span> than we ostensibly owed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">I asked him afterwards how come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">He said, well it's the principle of the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">You caused us a lot of pain, an awful lot of pain, and you're going to pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">It meant an awful lot to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">It was evident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Well, I did present this thing back to our finance people and I suppose if he's lucky why he got this money, but if he's not, it's still in the court of claims. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">Anyhow, the only point is that was a terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">These were people who didn't want to come back, who wouldn't have come back except that we appealed to their loyalty to those who had not survived and the need for someone to come and identify the malefactors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">So, he did, but you see he was in a very unhappy state to have to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">It was hurting him personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">And that's the kind of thing that everybody came with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">Those terrible memories that they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">They didn't want to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">They didn't want to repeat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">You may be able to tell in talking to me or listening to me that I am troubled when I even reflect back on my secondhand experience in living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">It was really terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1187">QUESTION:  In some ways you don't want to talk about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1188">ANSWER:  Well it isn't a matter of not wanting to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">It's had an affect on you and I dare say that every one of the people who were there, and went through it, after all they were all human beings, day after day after day, you put in two years of this sort of thing and one day after another and you get some feeling of being on sort of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carousel</span> that's never going to stop in the atrocity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1190">QUESTION:  Did you and the other lawyers talk about this? </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">What affect it was having on you all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1192">ANSWER:  No, I don't guess we did in that sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">I have no memory of -- we talked about specific cases, of course, I mean I might mention to someone what I thought about a case that I was trying.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1194">QUESTION:  Did you notice things that happened to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Did you have bad dreams?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1196">ANSWER:  I probably did have a lot of -- I did have some nightmarish dreams. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I still do as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">I woke up screaming one time a few days ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">My wife was wondering what had happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">That has been a long time since that had happened before, but that was in the last few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">Curious isn't it, these second hand affects. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">I guess that's a fair analysis, but, anyhow, all these people coming in day after day after day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">Men, women, what should have been children, now grown up, young people in a terrible condition that they are in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">It's a terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">I recall meeting some of the survivors even at this late date, so long afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">I taught a foreign affairs seminar out at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish community center</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rockwell</span> and I met quite a few of the survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">Some of them attended my class, as a matter of fact. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">I had the same impression. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">They never recover. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">They never recover. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">Some of them seemed to have recovered, but they just don't, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And to illustrate some of what I'm talking about, under the law of return, of course as you know, a lot of people who go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , did go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , had claims. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">And I used to use as a speaker a lady who was assigned to the <span class="BUILDING">Embassy</span> from here, I think she was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jeruselum</span> ; I think she was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , but she was a lawyer and assigned to do some legal work here for a year or two, and she used to come out and talk to my class at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rockwell</span> at the Montgomery college foreign affairs seminar that I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Her job when she was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in, I don't know whether it was the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> , but she was in the application of some of the laws under the law of return, was to decided who was going to get a portion of the money which had been paid in reparations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">So, she would say this one is entitled to this much, that one is -- and I suppose no one ever got enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">She said it was very painful and she herself, you could tell in talking with her that she was suffering as a consequence of the affect of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">It was very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1218">QUESTION:  Is there anything more you'd like to say about the war crimes trials? </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">Were they sufficient, were they insufficient?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1220">ANSWER:  The language I can think of -- we were talking about the attorney general Tom Clark. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">I was in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> on one of my trips <span class="BUILDING">home</span> reporting to him, and a congressman was in his <span class="BUILDING">office</span> at that time and several of his deputies were up there and I was just standing in the group of them, and because I was present the subject got around to war crimes program. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">There were some demurer being raised about what is it doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">How do we justify it and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">Everybody had a different view. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">I recall what he said, "Well, it all does seem to be expo facto, but what the hell are you going to do with those guys?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">That I think says it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">What are you going to do with them? </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">You can't let a thing like that go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">I've been asked several times about what to do about -- and I wrote an article about the Gulf War crimes, some part of it is about the Gulf War crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">What are you going to do with a fellow like Saddam Hussein. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">Is he supposed to go free? </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">Apparently he is, but you have no proper record. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">You've got a newspaper record. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">You've got perhaps some military records, but this is not the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">You really need a judicial record of this sort of thing in order to justify the existence of war crimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">If he goes free it sort of justifies winking and letting him go free across the board in the future, despite the fact that the U.N. has now authorized a war crimes program, but it's not going to be any better than the nations who apply it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">Apparently <span class="COUNTRY">Saudi Arabia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Kuwait</span> they don't want to apply it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">I had taken the position when I was asked in those days of the Gulf War, after the Gulf War, what to do about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">My feeling was we don't have to be involved personally but we should encourage the Saudies who would have a case, the Kuwaities who would have a case, the Egyptians who would have a case, and certainly the Israelies who would have a bigger case, that all of these would have a voice, but somebody should try these scoundrols meaning Suddam Hussein. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">Otherwise you don't have a judicial history of the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">To answer specifically the question about what I think about the war crimes case, it does give you a judicial history that condemns certain kinds of behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">That's important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1243">QUESTION:  Was it enough?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1244">ANSWER:  Well, its as much as we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">You know, there were a lot of people that got off light. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">Really the war criminals who did not get hanged in the ming and in the European and <span class="REGION">Asian Theater</span> , but particularly in the <span class="REGION">European Theater</span> , they can thank God that they were tried under a Western System of justice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1247">QUESTION:  Thank you so much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1248">ANSWER:  You're welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">Conclusion of Interview </span>
