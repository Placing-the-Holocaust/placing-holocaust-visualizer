<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Just to test the tape, we’re going to talk about what you think of the weather so far this summer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Well, it’s pretty hot, hazy and humid, the way the weather forecast says. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I love <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I don’t like the humidity right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">But last week it was lovely, for a week, for a few days and it’s getting hot again. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">But I don’t think that bothers me that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Nowadays you can get away from it if you want to, except right now, because of the air conditioned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and the air condition, so... 1S that enough? </span><span class="sentence" id="7">That you wanted to...
QUESTION:  That’s fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  And now you’re going to listen to it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  You know, I have a horrible feeling and I’m sure everybody who you talk to say, I know what my accent is like, but when you hear it, it sounds horrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Oh, I love it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  And you don’t want to believe that it sounds that bad, but I mean, you know, I have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So you cannot deny it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Well, I think people tend to... (tape goes off and on)
QUESTION:  It’s July the 15", 1999 and I’m with Ann Low Klein in her <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And this is a part of an interview project with Holocaust survivors in <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Ms. Low has been interviewed twice before, so this interview is going to...
ANSWER:  It’s Klein.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  I’m sorry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  You said, Ms. Low.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Oh, I’m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Ms. Klein has been interviewed twice before, so we’re going to focus this interview on areas of questioning that haven’t been discussed in those other two interviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And those interviews were conducted by, the first one was conducted by Mary K. Tachau in January 1982. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And that interview is now in the collection of the <span class="BUILDING">University of Louisville</span> , Kentucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And the second interview was a Survivors of the Shoah Foundation interview that was conducted on April 22™, 1996. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So, we’re going to start out by summarizing, more or less, what was said in 1 those interviews, which were very thorough, particularly the Mary K. Tachau interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And filling in on a few questions and then we’ll go on and mostly focus on Ms. Klein’s life in <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">So, I’m going to just read this summary and you tell me if I’ve gotten anything wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Actually, first of all before we start, you were born in October ninth, 1921 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eger</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I was interested in hearing before we go on from there, something about your family history. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Do you know anything about your family history?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  Yes, as much as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">People in those days didn’t go into a lot of details. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But my father was born in 1880 and my mother was born in 1879.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  Can you give their names, including her maiden name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">My mother’s maiden name was Frida Weisz and my father’s name was Béla Low. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">In Hungarian we would say Low Béla and Weisz Frida, you know the last name comes first. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">My father worked in a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> that was a chain. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">The main <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And then different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> would had <span class="BUILDING">branches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It was called at the time, and I don’t know whether you want to know it in Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">It was called the Magyar Atolanos Hitel Bank. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Magyar means... and the <span class="BUILDING">Hitel Bank</span> was the name of the outfit. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">My father became, first he probably was a clerk and I would not remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And actually married my mother, who was working in that <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> before. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">That’s how they apparently met. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">This was a second marriage for my father, because his wife, the first wife, died maybe after two years of marriage, and then he married my mom. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And she was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fegyvernek</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and my father was born in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tiszafured</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Now, my father became the manager of the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and so those are the years I would remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">In Hungarian, they were called the izgazgato (ph) of the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , but here you would call the manager, I think, or the director of that <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And he did work there for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">We lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a little bit away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And when I was four years old we moved into the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> was, above the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> there was a nice big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And we were very comfortable in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I remember we had pretty <span class="DLF">gardens</span> and so on and so forth, up to the age of four. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And after that we lived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">downtown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So all I remember that toward the end, I think my father was supposedly had to retire, already maybe at age sixty, where people here maybe retire only in sixty-five. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">They had a lovely and very nice ceremony for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">In fact, I owned— but unfortunately I don’t own anymore—they gave him a silver wreath, which the employees, all the employees’ names were signed on. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And they gave a lovely, nice speech at his retirement. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I do have a picture of that, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">You know, I was really lucky that either relatives or maybe it was left in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I have more pictures than many other people who lost everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">We lost everything, but still for example, and if you would be interested toward the end, I would show you that picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">He’s sitting at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> and that was the time he retired from the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And my mother, after... she had three children, so she didn’t work, so that was before they got married, I think, that she was like a secretary, maybe, in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So, that’s what my parents... except then he had a very good friend, who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">He wasn’t a Jewish guy, who had vineyards in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Because our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eger</span> is very famous of its wine and vineyards. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And as a friendship, that wasn’t really a paid job, he helped that friend to take care of the vineyard. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I mean, not so much take care, because he had employees, but look after it a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And they had an apple orchard and he was doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So, we went out to that vineyard many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And it was a pleasant way that I remember my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">You don’t want to know much about my childhood, no more like about my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">2
QUESTION:  You talked a fair amount about your childhood in the other...
ANSWER:  See, I don’t remember what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So, that’s about really about my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And then in one of the interviews, I did tell them that when the Germans came in, he was the head of that five member committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So, I don’t want to repeat myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  So, this is about all I can tell about my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And I might have talked about my brothers, but this is the answer that what my father did, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  I wondered if you knew about your grandparents and about your family’s history in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  I have pictures of them, but very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I really don’t...I have a picture of my grandfather and grandmother on my father’s side and no pictures on my mother’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I know absolutely nothing of the family history on my mother’s side, except that she had two sisters and we were close to the sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But not previously what happened to the father or mother or when they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">My father’s mother died when I was five years old and I do remember that, because, you know, in Jewish funerals, you know, there was a black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">casket</span> , and we were... but when my grandfather died, I do not remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I think he died, might have died before I ever was born.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Do you know what brought your parents both to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eger</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  No, sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Going on with the summary of your experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So, you did talk some about your brothers and then after the German occupation in March of 1944, you were moved into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Lived there for three weeks and then you were taken to a <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> , called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kerecsend</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And there for a few days, then from there, loaded onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , where you were separated from your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">You worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Not right away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  Not right away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  First I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> for a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> in a lager, which was called A Lager. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And two weeks after that I got in on the kitchen work. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So that had to be, we were taken out in June, July, it had to be about toward the end of July.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  In January of 1945, you were forced to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to go on a Death March towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And you were at that point, with a group of four other girls, who you had kind of become close with, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">3
ANSWER:  Closer, but I really mainly, that close to one, who she worked with me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , who I still keep contact with, who lives now in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">She was from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , actually, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Isad</span> (ph), which nowadays is very much in the news. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And she’s really the one, who I kept close. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">If you would ask me what were the other girls’ names, I do not remember, and I do not know, and...
QUESTION:  Do you know what became of them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I never kept in touch with any of the others, except one other girl, who was from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And I don’t even believe we worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> together, but towards, during the Death March, we ran into each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">She was older than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">She used to be a seamstress. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And in my stories, I think it’s mentioned that on some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> rides, after we were already liberated, we were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And I do know what happened to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And she lives, she remarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">She had a husband earlier and then she remarried and they, to my surprise, they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And he died in the meantime. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I think he was an artist. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And although I never thought I want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but at one point, with some friends from here, we did a two weeks tour in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , which took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And my, another friend who knew of her, gave me her address and phone number. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And I wrote to her and she came over to see, visit me in the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">That’s the first time I have seen her after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> times. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And she still lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">She’s much older than I am, so at times I’ve heard that she’s kind of ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So, I don’t know what she’s doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I have a feeling her husband was originally from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and then, you know, I think they were getting money after the Holocaust and they made their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  What was her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  Rosenfeld, B6zsi. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">B6zsi’s like Elizabeth and Rosenfeld was her last name. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">That was actually her name from the first marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">That’s the way we always knew her and I do not know what her next husband’s name was. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So, we called her Rosenfeld, B6zsi and she was from Eger. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And that’s all. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I never kept up with anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I don’t know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">But I agree with you that I did talk about five girls a lot together, but they were not from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And as I said in my stories, that my memory is not that good. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Certain things are very vivid in my mind and certain things like it never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So, I can’t give you any names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  How did you become so close with Ilus!?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  She worked... yeah, I remember, she worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And she’s exactly my age and somehow we liked each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And then what has happened, that after that people were separated a lot, transports were leaving, and my husband’s two sisters were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but they were taken away to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And they worked like, the so-called forced labor, now in <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">But then we came so close and when people were separated from their so- called loved ones, of course our parents were gone, but we didn’t know exactly what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We somehow decided that we just never want to separate from each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And we did become good friends to the last minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I told you that, maybe, or I might have said it in the video, that my husband thinks that maybe I survived because of her and she thinks maybe because of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">But she was a bright girl and lot more outgoing or spoke lot of languages and ' Born Ilus Fleischman; later lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and changed her name to Ilana Fried. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">4 therefore she was very informed of lot of things what were happening after the January so-called Death March. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">She met people more, and so, I got some information from her, which she remembered and I never remembered myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  Was her situation similar to yours, in that she had lost her parents, she had been separated from her parents in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and they were... ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  Yes, and I do not remember the details of her background, although we used to talk about that, I assume. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But I do not recall it. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Well everybody lost their parents the same way, but I don’t even remember if she was taken out with her parents together or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So, I cannot give you any information about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Then later she got married and they moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And we kept up. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">In fact, last year I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and she came to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and spent a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">So we saw each other then. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And unfortunately now, she lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Netanya</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Have you ever been in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , yourself? </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And the last I heard of her, she was hit by a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And she doesn’t have any family anymore, because she never had any children. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Her husband died years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">She might have a niece or some, so she was very, very down with the idea of that she had enough already during <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And she was first in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Then she was in some sort of a nursing home situation, because I think she had a broken hip and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">And in that age, she’s very little and fragile. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And then she is now back in her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="174">She doesn’t like to write, but she calls once in a while and I write. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I write more than I call, because in a short conversation you cannot... but she’s somewhat better, but pretty depressed by the whole situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Because she says it was very painful, and really nobody who can take care of her except nurses would come to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And so I felt very sorry about that, because I used to say that and now she must have felt the same way, that one tragedy was enough, how many more do you have to have? </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And for her, you know, that was an additional something that she certainly wasn’t looking forward to. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">That’s all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  You mentioned about that time that you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , that you didn’t fully believe what was happening there. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And as far as... as far as your relationship with Ilus, did she believe, was she more informed than you were on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  Well Ilus I met later, somewhat later, not even in the beginning of my kitchen work. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Later, because I worked first in one part of the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , then in another <span class="NPIP">part</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I think we met a little bit later. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But I don’t know, you have talked to a lot of Holocaust survivors, and I don’t know whether I’m just so naive or I was so naive at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Because you know, I even read right now, just last week, I read a book, you probably read it, Night of Eli Wiesel. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Have you read that book?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  I actually have only read parts of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  Well, it’s a very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I read that just in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> , while, you know, I had a little time to read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And you know, the stories I hear of people, you know, when they arrived and they would see the smoke and they maybe right away would have known what that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Or maybe if somebody told them, they believed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Well, I am either very naive... I could never have believed anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">We did see the smoke, and the people who were there already, the first two or three years, they of course knew exactly what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">They were from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> 5 or <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and they would tell us. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">But I assumed that they were kind of jealous that we were coming just in the last minute of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">See, they were already suffering for three years and suffered quite a bit, you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And whoever survived that three years, they were pretty tough and kind of mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Because a lot of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> were Jewish refugees, I mean not refugees, but prisoners from way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And I used to think that they just want to scare us, or they tell us stories which is so unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">So, I never thought about that since my parents disappeared that first day, that they would have been burned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  Do you think that was important for your survival that you didn’t believe it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  Well, I hope so. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">It could be. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And we didn’t read about this that much, you know like I listened or read different kind of stories about people. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Even, even this Eli Wiesel said that in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> they did not know anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We did not know anything about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And I don’t think my parents did. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">At the same time, my parents were very protective, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">They were the type of people that they didn’t want to scare you. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Even if they would have known a little bit more, they did not discuss that. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And if we would listen to the Voice of America, which I said in my interviews before about what’s going on and we would hear Hitler screaming and yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> were not... we did not know anything about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Like when we’re in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I never knew where we are going, and I never was afraid that it’s going to be <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , because I did not know anything about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And I am talking only about myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">You can talk to somebody else maybe and they have an entire different... and you want to know my feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">We were going somewhere and it was miserable, but we didn’t know where.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">QUESTION:  Can you tell me, can you trace in your memory, how it happened that you became aware of what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> meant?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  I mean, later in... when we would have believed that they really... I can’t remember when that came to our mind, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">For a long, long time we thought that, you know, our parents are somewhere in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and taking care of the kids who were also taken away from people. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Well, I was the youngest, and I didn’t have, but as I told you in one of the stories, that my sister- in-laws had little children, a four and a six year old. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Well, they wouldn’t have imagined that they were burned in the gas chambers. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">They would have thought that the mother was taking care of the kids in a different kind of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">When did we came to the realization? </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Toward the very end. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I think maybe even during the Death March, and we heard this over and over and over again, we assumed maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">But it wasn’t that it just happened one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And I never remember really, crying that suddenly now I might not have my parents anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It is just... everything was so gradual that I couldn’t recall anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And I wanted to get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">By then, I kind of knew that I’m not going to find my parents there, but I had big hopes that I would find my brothers, because I didn’t know what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Of course, I didn’t find them either, and I have mentioned that in some of my interviews. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">But when did that happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I don’t really know. (</span><span class="sentence" id="235">Doorbell rings.) </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Oh gosh, would you turn that off for a minute?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  Well, I wondered if you got to any point where you, even if it was years after the war, where you cried for them? </span><span class="sentence" id="238">That it hit you or that you felt safe enough to really mourn. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">6
ANSWER:  Yeah, well I could even cry now, but see what it 1s, that what amazes me, that during that time that we were in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and so many horrible things were going on, I don’t remember really ever crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="241">The shock was so great. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And afterwards, see, when I got back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , there was just, it was such a trauma, the whole thing, that you know, it was almost like you were, like you were under the influence of some sort of magical thing that everything hit you all at once. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And so, I don’t, of course I, even now, and you know I have pictures, or when I couldn’t find my brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But it’s funny, I wasn’t... it’s not funny at all, but I apparently didn’t cry that easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I mean I might have held it back more. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And the tears come now, for example, I see a program on television, not about the Holocaust, but about something, a little kid getting hurt or little... I can so easily cry and have tears, you know, over that, but with this big event what happened, that was just so much, that I... I didn’t... like that we go to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> when we are in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , because they have a memorial for the adults and then they have a special one for the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">My family’s names are on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And it’s just, you know, you’re just under, it’s a shock kind of, which never left me for ever, ever and ever, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Then I had other traumas yet, which I might have talked about it or I might have not. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">But I don’t want to jump ahead of myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">You ask me the question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  Okay, well I’m not concerned about sticking to a chronology, so you can talk about...We’ll just get back to the chronology when...
ANSWER:  I don’t know, I think that what made me survive, that I must be kind of tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Or maybe I was brought up in a nice <span class="BUILDING">family home</span> and I didn’t have any upsetting situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But I think it has a lot to do, that some people are stronger for some reason and some people are not that strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And I was able to handle many situations which for other people might have been very dramatic and I could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">So, it must be my personality that I was able to... to survive, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">No? </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Because you can get sick and you can die or they can kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">But maybe the feeling that you don’t give up easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Or it’s like in my story, I might have said some that we had lice and we would spend hours trying to get rid of the lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Or if we were starving, you know, I was able to... then I was lucky that I didn’t get really sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I mean, that I don’t think has anything to do with one’s personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">You may be stronger, and I’m a pretty strong person. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">But in those days, you know, being out in January and February, you could have gotten anything and just died, but I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And that I considered luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I don’t think that it’s a personality. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Somebody who is stronger, maybe can endure all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So I’m not sure exactly what might have caused that, that I was able to deal with it better than maybe the other people, who even now, maybe... I hate it that they have nightmares about it and they remember all the horrible things. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I think about it a lot and I remember them, but I deal with it, except sometimes it looks to me that, that wasn’t me. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">That had to be somebody else, because up to this moment, I can’t believe and can’t understand how in the world somebody can survive it. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And then talk about it later in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">It’s... I have a hard time understanding that and I still feel that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">QUESTION:  And somebody pretty young...
ANSWER:  I was not that young, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I really not a 15-year-old kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I was in my 23s or 24s. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So, I was mature enough to deal with it, but I worried about... see after the... and as of today, I’m going to say something to you, I just thought about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">They died the way, you know how they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And at the same time I tried to compromise with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I mean, I’m not trying to forgive Hitler 7 ever, or what happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">But if I saw younger people with their mother doing the same things I was doing and they would beat that mother or that mother was starving, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Just the thought of that for me would have been horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">So, the way I think now that they suddenly were killed and they didn’t suffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">That makes me feel almost better than if I would have gone with them maybe for half a year and then slowly they would have died. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Because they were in their sixties, they weren’t young. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Some people were only maybe in their forties. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">But when I was born, my mother was already forty years old, so she had to be 63 some years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And in those days those were already old people, but they were healthy people. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I never seen them sick or, you know, in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , in fact, with a sickness. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">So, to me, seeing them suffer right next to you would have been almost worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I mean, I don’t know if anybody ever felt that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Because if they could have survived the whole thing, that’s a different story, but at that age, not many older people could survive it. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">So. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">End of Tape 1, Side A 8 Tape 1, Side B
QUESTION:  This is tape number one, side B of an interview with Ann Low Klein. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">Well, let’s, I have some questions about the things that you brought up, but let’s try to get back to them later and we’ ll get back right now to the summary, to just finish saying what happened to you during the wartime. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">I believe when we left off, we mentioned that you were on a Death March. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">You were forced to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbruck</span> with this group of other girls and then we went off talking about what had become of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So, you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> for about three weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrick</span> for three weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">QUESTION:  And then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Malchow</span> for about two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And then there was a lot of traveling around to various <span class="NPIP">places</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="301">ANSWER:  Well, either walking or in open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">The open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was right after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , the evacuation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , because I remember it was very cold and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were open. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">And I have already told that story, so I don’t want to really repeat myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> unless you really would want to, I haven’t looked at my notes again, many of the names I got from my friend, Ilus. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Because she remembered names very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> really was the most famous one, but nobody... it wasn’t really a camp for us anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">It was gathering places. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And wherever, like what you mentioned near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> , this Malchow, it wasn’t that we were supposed to be working there or we were supposed to be doing anything there. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">It was just a stop during the wandering around or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So, the last part of it, which I (coughs) excuse me, I already mentioned before, on the open <span class="DLF">field</span> , where I ran into a lot of the... even some people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , by then there were no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , it was just... but by then the weather was a little bit better, because it was springtime. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So we wouldn’t suffer from ice and cold and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">But our main and worse situation was in ice and cold and snow, trying to stop and sit down and possibly freeze to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Is where my friend, Ilus and I kept ourselves from trying to avoid that if possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Because we were told that, that can happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">But after that I couldn’t tell you any of the real <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> because then we ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzen</span> and that was...
QUESTION:  And then finally you were actually liberated during that time of wandering, the last two weeks of the war, you were liberated by American Army in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzen</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , where you stayed for about three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And you were recovering from an infection to your arm, to your finger. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Oh yeah, that finger nail 1s still...
ANSWER:  It’s still gone forever, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And so those were the start, and I show that to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">This scar was my tattoo number and this where my hands are very worked up, there is a little scar. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And a little scar right here, where the pus had to be taken out, because I would have... okay that was another way you could have died. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I had blood poisoning, but with that surgery, since by then we were liberated, and they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">If the war would to have gone on further, longer, I don’t know what would have happened to that arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But I never thought about it then either, except that was very painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">And that was taken care of in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And after that, 1t took a while for that to heal, I assume. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And I never did get my finger nails back, but that should be my biggest problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">9
QUESTION:  You described going to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czech parachute camp</span> , where British soldiers wanted to take you to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , but you went to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> instead because you were hoping to find your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  Well, because, yeah, well, we were, they wanted to help us and that was only this friend of mine and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And yes, I remember that very clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They gave us real good food, I mean really food what we had never had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Because, as I told you before, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wurzen</span> the first thing was I would eat the bag full of sugar and I would eat pickles. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I mean that’s alone a reason too, not to survive, I think, but then again, maybe I was strong or I don’t get sick that easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But after we heard about a transport, maybe from that <span class="REGION">area</span> , leaving toward <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , we left them a note and we told them “Thank you very much, but we’re going to try,” and we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And that was a few more weeks of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">If I would look at my notes, I might even get some ideas around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bern</span> , for example, but I don’t think it’s that important and that would really stretch it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going slowly at different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Now, my friend, the reason she remembered more, first of all, she spoke languages better. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">She spoke French, she spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">She was from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="340">She spoke the Slavic languages, so in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> she could understand some of the Czecho... so, she found out a lot of little things, exactly where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">And I was immobilized because of that surgery on my arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So my arm was all tied up, so I didn’t run around as easily as she did. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Like, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would stop and then some people would bring up some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">That was, of course, after the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Or she would go down, they asked her down to a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and they give her something to eat and then she would bring some. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But I just stayed put, because it was kind of hard for me to get around with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And that was painful, because those things had to heal. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">But you know it’s because that’s the way I remember, and any other questions I’Il be glad to help you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  Just on the subject of your strength and being strong enough to survive that and also having the luck to survive it. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I was wondering about your, how you thought of yourself and how you remember yourself before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">You mentioned that during the war you just didn’t cry and that now you can cry at little things. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">But before the war was your personality that way? </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Did you ever cry then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  No, I don’t remember that I was... I wasn’t pampered really, by my parents, although they had the means. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">But I remember... I don’t think I was really spoiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I was spoiled by them not to share bad news. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So, that’s one thing I remember so well. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Like my older brother was ill, had some sort of a lung problem in his <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> year. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">They took him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and the lungs had to be filled at that time, you know that was more complicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">They never scared me with all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Or I remember my younger brother, who was four years older than Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">He once, he lived in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , worked also in a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And he must have gotten sick with some sort of a so-called blood disease where the white cells were more than the red cells or so on and I didn’t quite understand the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And my parents would talk to them on the phone and I think they were worried about what was going on, but then he got well. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">But they never, ever shared the worry with me, so therefore I was not exposed to anything bad, ever, up to that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="367">My parents lived together and my brother... we were... it was a close-knit family, but not a spoiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">You know, like my father had probably enough money, but I made a big deal of asking for money. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I remember I would say and that they laughed about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">That’s not important to the interview, but I would say, “I have a real, real, real big favor to ask, and a real 10 big favor to ask.” </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And they didn’t know what it was I wanted, ten cents or 25 cents. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I mean, I made a big deal about it, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So up to the last moment that was the way I was brought up. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">My bad parts was my <span class="BUILDING">Catholic high school</span> at the last year, which also was in my interview, because one of the nuns was very anti-Semitic and that hurt my feeling very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But there again, I didn’t cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">I couldn’t object to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">It wasn’t like nowadays, people protest. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">So, I had to kind of swallow it and live with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So, I don’t remember ever being very upset or that I got hurt easily, you know, like some people get hurt over everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">I had friends and they liked me and I liked them and somehow that’s the way I was brought up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">QUESTION:  So it wasn’t as if the war came and you became a different person?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="382">ANSWER:  No, I think my personality was kind of strong all my, but I didn’t have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">It was easy to be strong when I had all the comfort. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">It’s different. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> time on, it hit us. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">It’s just like for everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">But you might have had interviews with some people, maybe they had a bad childhood or maybe somebody was abusive. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And who knows? </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I didn’t have any of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">It hit me at the time when the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">And I read that other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , too, people didn’t imagine it could happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And we never imagined that it could happen to us, whatever was happening, everything was gradual. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">You know, the giving up your whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">brick factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">It just... it hit you and we had to face it and I did without any, you know, any crying, temper or fighting it. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">The only upset points I would have, and would see again my parents sitting in front of our <span class="BUILDING">ghetto home</span> , where it was raining and they had to leave their stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I always used to think that they had all the nice things and now you just have to leave it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">So, I always felt more sorry for them than for myself at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">That’s the way I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="399">QUESTION:  What about when the war ended and you started trying to just go about your life? </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Did you feel as 1f you were transformed? </span><span class="sentence" id="401">You were a different person than you had been before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="402">ANSWER:  Well I was in a way like, by the time I got back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and I realized that I don’t have... I really realized that my parents are gone and my brothers are gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And I have mentioned in some of the interviews how I found about what happened to my brothers, so I don’t want to repeat myself to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">But everything was still completely like a dream type of a thing, because I remember that people wanted me to meet friends and get together with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And I was just like, like blindfolded. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I did what I was told. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I didn’t have my own personality, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I don’t remember much about the time, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">And I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> for a whole year before I came out to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And some things are fairly vivid in my mind, some people I don’t even remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I just really don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">I don’t know if I ever mentioned it, before the war they wanted me to marry somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Did I say that? </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I don’t know whether that’s important, but there was a real good friend of ours, a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">He was a lawyer and they were rich people. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And their nephew got married to a girl in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , who 1s still alive now somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">I never see her anymore, but she lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And that person who was marrying the girl brought his cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And they lived somewhere in the <span class="REGION">Yugoslavian area</span> and they were big farmers or landlords, landholders and very rich people. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And they all decided that that would be a great situation for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  Who decided that, your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="422">11
ANSWER:  That’s... no, the couple, whose nephew was marrying the one girl and brought his cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And they had a big dinner, a get together. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And I don’t know that should be in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> , but... briefly I would say it was a big dinner and I sat next to that guy and enough that he invited me to go to where he lives and meet his parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And my mother and I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and we went with this guy... can’t even remember his name anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">It was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">They waited for us with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleigh</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">So, I liked, only thing is the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleigh</span> rides in the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And at that time, of course, I knew my husband by then, because we were growing up together. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">We came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I liked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And I certainly didn’t like that guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">He was like about ten years older than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And so on the way back, on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , I used my personality, where I might have cried, and told my mother, “I absolutely don’t want anything to do with this situation.” </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And they accepted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They didn’t force me to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">But I think I was very upset and I might have cried then. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I kind of said, ““No way do I want to do that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But then after the war, people wanted me to meet a friend and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And it’s very vague in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I can’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I love music and somebody, my husband’s wife, they got married just before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Not my husband’s, I’m sorry, my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And she got me some opera tickets and I liked opera at the time, it’s a season ticket. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And I went to all that because I was told to do but I didn’t have my heart in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It was just something that I was so vague and my girlfriend, and I think I might have said that. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">She was my good friend, who 1s still a friend of mine and I still see her all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">She sometimes comes to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I have been visiting her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  What’s her name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  Her name is, her maiden name was Fleischman, Ibi. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And the very interesting thing is that my friend from <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , her maiden name was Fleischman, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Isn’t that strange? </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And then she married, the woman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , married a furrier and his name was Fischer. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And they had a furrier business and when I arrived back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , I went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And I remember one thing, that I stood against a <span class="DLF">wall</span> and of course, they never knew what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And I think it was very vivid in my mind and I told my story to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Then she hired me. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">She gave me a job, and I worked in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Oh, I don’t know, just help out and they taught me how to make patterns for fur coats. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">You know there is a way to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And I worked in that <span class="NPIP">furrier place</span> until it was time for me to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And I might have, you remember my tape? </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I must have told in it that I got a letter, letters from my sister-in-laws, where they were happy that I’m going to becoming a member of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And then I got a letter from my husband where he asked me to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> time, that year and a half, I had to go back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I had to give up my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I had to sell things which were so dear to my parents and cost, must have cost a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I practically had to just give it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">It was inflation time. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And so, I got rid of all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I got some money out of it, not very much, very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And then I...
QUESTION:  Yeah, you did talk about that in the interview with...
ANSWER:  ...with Mary K.
QUESTION:  ...Mary K.
ANSWER:  Yeah, I must have. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">12
QUESTION:  But I thought it would be a good time too, for you to say something that you haven’t talked about in either interview, which is how you met Sandy and how long you’ve known him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  Well, I’ve known him from the time he was a little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">He’s a year older than I am and we lived just a block away. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And at that time, he used to play the violin and I used to play the piano. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And we belonged to the same <span class="BUILDING">music school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And we did by then, like I was teenager, maybe fourteen and he might have been 15 and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And we had some pieces that we played together and then there would be a recital, and we did... so those are the ways that we really... and then we played tennis together and his sister was a friend of mine, who is... in fact, she’s coming August the 5"". </span><span class="sentence" id="480">She now lives in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">She was one of them who had a little child and lost the child, and she’s coming to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And then he fell in love with me more, when, you know, you’re 16 or 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And before he left, and he would ask me, he said he’s going to marry me. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And of course, he was only eighteen and I was sixteen and a half and he left to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">So, all kind of things could have happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">But I remember we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> at one time because I had to... no, he had to go after his papers, because he had an uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> , who brought him out with a student visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And then he went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And so, for a while, until 1941, he would write very frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And like, I think I might have mentioned that for my birthday, he would ask his mother and she would send a bouquet of a hundred red roses, which at that time... she paid for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And I think it wasn’t as expensive as it is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">But then the war came in ‘41 and after that, I never heard from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">First of all, you couldn’t get letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">He was in the service, in the Army, Air Force, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So, that was about, but we played ping pong together. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I mean, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eger</span> is a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> wasn’t really that big. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And by then when I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , we really didn’t keep up with our non-Jewish friends that much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">QUESTION:  Had you, did you feel about Sandy the way that he felt about you, in those early days?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">ANSWER:  Yeah, I did, but I was a little bit, I remember at one point, I mean, I don’t know why that <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> has to know about it, but I remember I was telling my friend, the one who still lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and who I’m close to, he was very much after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And then you know how sometimes you get tired of it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">He wanted to be with me a lot and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And then my friend said, “Just stay away, pretend that you’re not interested,” and then he will change being after me like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">And he did just that. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">So, he stayed away and then I suddenly thought to myself, well it’s more than... you know, I really didn’t want to stay away. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So, I felt the same way toward him, but see I was younger and I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic high school</span> , and we had friends after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And I had a boyfriend later, whom I really liked very much, but differently than Sandy. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Because he was the kind of guy I would have never wanted to marry. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And he flirted with one girl and then with another and then with a third one. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">But he was that type, you know, that it was more like being impressed by he was somewhat after me, but at the same time I would know that he would be after a divorced woman and have two other girlfriends here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">So, he wasn’t very stable. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">So I would have never, ever have considered...
QUESTION:  When was that? </span><span class="sentence" id="511">13
ANSWER:  That was after Sandy left. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">It had to be after 19... between 1939 and °41, and then I guess, I’m not sure what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Then of course, he never survived either. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">But I would have never... it wasn’t a serious situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I would have never considered...
QUESTION:  What about after the war when you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , were you thinking a lot about Sandy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  See, then, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and I told you that, we only thought about food and never about boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And after I got back, it wasn’t very much after I arrived, see, that I got those letters from my sister-in-laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And the first time that he wrote to me, which I still have that letter, in which he asked me and gave me the choice of, that he thought about that he wants his sisters come... I think I mentioned that he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> to get his sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And he took them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casablanca</span> , because he was stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Casablanca</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And then he wanted to have the girls come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , which didn’t work out, because one went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">The other one stayed and married somebody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">But he kind of thought that I could come out and we all could live together. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">We would get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">If it works, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">If it doesn’t, we could always separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">See that was ten years after and you know a lot of things happen during ten years. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">So, when I got that letter, you know, I never had a second thought that that ought not to work out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="528">QUESTION:  So, you weren’t afraid that maybe you’d both changed in that almost ten years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="529">ANSWER:  I wasn’t afraid of it, but it helped me not to be afraid of it, that I didn’t have to leave anybody behind, and that’s very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">If my parents would have been alive, I don’t know whether I could have that easily leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Because at that time, you know, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was pretty far. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And... or my brothers, I didn’t have anybody to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I mean I didn’t have that feeling that, “Oh my God, what would be my choice?” </span><span class="sentence" id="534">So, when I got that letter, I right away thought I’d like to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And not because I wanted to come out to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but I knew him well and I felt like... you know I never had a second thought that I ought not to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">But I didn’t have my parents anymore to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I didn’t have my brothers to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I had maybe a friend or so, but I didn’t mind leaving her. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So, it was a test again that I was hoping that it will work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I wasn’t absolutely sure about that, but I wanted to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="541">QUESTION:  What were your ideas about the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or preconceptions about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="542">What had you expected?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="543">ANSWER:  Well, Sandy has written to me while I was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> for six weeks, practically every day, and gave me a lot of ideas of what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And two things were interesting...
QUESTION:  Maybe I should just interrupt you to point, to say that, for the sake of the tape, that after the war you spent a year or so in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">ANSWER:  Between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eger</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , but I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> with an aunt and an uncle, who took me in. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eger</span> I only went because I had to give up my <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I had to deal with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I had an uncle, my father’s brother, who moved into our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> after... and he was the first who came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">So a lot of stuff that I have left, that I found maybe pictures or something like that, it could be that it got into his hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">14
QUESTION:  What was that like, to return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eger</span> and have to deal with that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">ANSWER:  Well, the first thing, for example, was tremendously strange, but I do remember that we had help in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , when I was growing up, and my mother tried to make me once in a while to, to help a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I think she wanted to train me to become eventually a good housewife. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I think all mothers like to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And I remember that one day she was making me dust the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , although all my friends were downstairs already, down on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And I kept on looking out and I was just upset that I couldn’t be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I could have done dusting the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> in two seconds, but instead of that, I was fooling around and I wished I would be down with my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">So anyway, I was procrastinating that kind of stuff apparently, like many other kids, I didn’t want to maybe do what my chore would have been. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">After I came back and I had that big <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and I remember I worked like a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">You know, we had hardwood floors. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And at that time, you know, you didn’t have the kind of waxers and the facilities and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vacuum cleaners</span> like they have them now. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">I remember I had a brush I put on the one foot and I waxed the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And under your other foot, you have a rag. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I mean, you never saw anything like that, but...
QUESTION:  Had anyone lived in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  Well, yes, different people lived in it and then they moved out and when I came back, my uncle was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">But I tried to get the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> back in the shape like I remembered that it was before. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">And all I could, always, and I think I cried at that time, if my mother just would see now, how I’m trying to take care of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , when earlier I wouldn’t even want to dust the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So, I was very proud of myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And you know, I mean, I don’t remember the crying spells, but I would get very emotional, even now that I’m talking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">If she just could have seen now what I’m doing, when I really didn’t have to, but I did it for myself or maybe to just the way the <span class="NPIP">place</span> looked like before. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I wanted to put it back into that same shape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">QUESTION:  It sounds like, over the years, it’s kind of been, that your parents have been with you and a lot of times, you think about them looking on the things you’ve done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">ANSWER:  I do, I even could cry, see, right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">But when you’re in the middle of it, you know, I think I just took it the way I had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">But yes, of course, I mean I do think about them a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">QUESTION:  Did you sell that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  That <span class="BUILDING">house</span> wasn’t owned by us. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Our first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> what we lived in, which was very pretty and very big, with a big <span class="DLF">garden</span> , that was sold. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">This <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , I think, belonged to, as I said, it was above the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And I think that was rented. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">So, I didn’t sell anything there. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I had to sell furnitures. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And I had to get rid of all that, but the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> didn’t belong to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And I wrote, I gave, I talked to Mary K. about that, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="583">QUESTION:  Yes, you did. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So you were talking about when you came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or I interrupted you. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">You were talking about how, well I wanted to say for the sake of the tape that when you 15 were leaving, heading toward the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , you spent six weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> first, and that was in 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="587">ANSWER:  1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I left in November and arrived to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> in 1947, January. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So, I left in November and by the time I arrived here, I mean to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , it was January the 20". </span><span class="sentence" id="590">That was very hard six weeks for me, because I was alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">It was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">End of Tape 1, Side B 16 Tape 2, Side A
QUESTION:  This is tape number two, side A of an interview with Ann Low Klein. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Since you talked about your experiences in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> when you did the interview with Mary K. Tachau, I wanted to focus on, you also talked about arriving and what happened once you arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and the scary experience that you had being detained before you were let off. (</span><span class="sentence" id="594">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="595">You did talk about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="596">ANSWER:  Yeah, so I don’t want to repeat that. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">That was just for one night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">QUESTION:  One thing that I was particularly interested in was that it looked like... let me check my notes. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">But it looked like you arrived, you arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> on January 20".</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">QUESTION:  And then you were married on January 29"?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">ANSWER:  The 29",
QUESTION:  My goodness. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So, how did you, was it difficult to... and also you mentioned that Sandy was in finals at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So, he was extremely busy when you arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">How did you... when did you have time to catch up together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">ANSWER:  Well, I have also managed... I must have told in the interview that he had an uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , so I stayed with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And that was very hard for me too, as I mentioned, because I couldn’t speak the language. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And they were friendly and nice with me, but when you can’t communicate... I mean, everything 1s so strange when you are at a new <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">But what I must say now, and I don’t know if I ever said it. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">That I still, at this moment, I have this kind of a feeling that I compare things to the 1944 situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And I always used to think that’s very hard, but how much better it is than it was then. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So, everything in all my life, since then, I compare it to, lots of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">That if I was able to take that, my God, I should be able to take this. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">It wasn’t that easy, but he, after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> he would come over and then we would go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Then we would try, 1t wasn’t that easy, because ten years went by, but we knew we were getting married, and it was... you had to adjust to that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Plus I don’t think I talked too much about my experiences then. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And he loved music and we talked about music, so on, and then we had a very small wedding and I must have told that to Mary K. And so, it was just something that I could adjust to things, easier I think than maybe many other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And if something 1s a hardship or like, you could say, “My God you haven’t been with him for a long time, that must have been hard.” </span><span class="sentence" id="619">Must have been hard to be in a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , a nice <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> with an American woman and a Hungarian man, but who has been in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> since age 14, children who wanted to be nice to me, but it’s hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And it was hard, but I adjusted to that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And I mean I didn’t suffer, because I thought this is for, toward the better. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And I always compared things like that, even as of today, I put things on a scale in my mind, and how would it be better, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And so I adjust to things easier, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">See I don’t know whether I told Mary K. about my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> experiences or did we talk about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="625">17
QUESTION:  Just a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">You mentioned that you were living in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> with no running water and Sandy was in <span class="BUILDING">Graduate school</span> at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="627">ANSWER:  Yeah, yeah, so I don’t want to repeat it again, but to me that’s a hardship. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I mean not... I hada nice <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we always had running water in <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , we didn’t have anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">In the <span class="BUILDING">Bloomington campus</span> , living in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> , in a tiny, little <span class="NPIP">place</span> , where I had to bring the water in at night and go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">john</span> and take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And not many people who were brought up in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with all the comfort would accept that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  Did you talk with Sandy about your experiences during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  Oh, I’m sure I did, but I don’t recall it exactly when. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I’m sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And, you know, but I don’t think that I talked about it all the trme. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And as I mentioned, I didn’t talk to other people for a long time about it, till the opportunity arose that I would, maybe this subject matter would come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">But that was years and years after. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">But I don’t think this was my topic of conversation that I would talk about that all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I probably thought about it a lot, but I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And when my kids were growing up, I didn’t want to, I didn’t want to, I didn’t want to make a big emphasis on that I’m Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">They knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I mean, we are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">But because you are Jewish, something like this could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I didn’t want them to grow up like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">My older daughter was, later on in life, objecting to it that I was holding many things back. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">I did not want them to feel that they would be persecuted just because they are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">They knew I was Jewish and Sandy was, but I didn’t make a big deal about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">So, I was holding back. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I didn’t tell them stories about it till they got much, much older. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Now they all have the tape and they know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">But I didn’t feel that, that should be important. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I didn’t want to make them worried and unhappy as time would go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">QUESTION:  Did you feel safe in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">ANSWER:  I did, except in my interview I might have told you that I got a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Did I say that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> to do alteration at <span class="BUILDING">Garfinkel Department Store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And you had to fill out the application and they asked what religion you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And I think I wrote down, or I might put a dash, but I was very worried about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">You know, I thought to myself this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is a safe <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and it’s a free <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and why do they want to know? </span><span class="sentence" id="659">What could be the result of it? </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So, for a very long time, for years, and I told that in one of the interviews, I worked in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> and I was afraid that they were going to ask me what <span class="BUILDING">church</span> I go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I wouldn’t have lied to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">ANSWER:  But it concerned me that this should be a topic of conversation and what could be the result if they find out that I’m Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And that worried me for a long, long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I thought that in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , everything is free. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And I also told you that when I... in my interview, I’m sure, that when I arrived to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and we were waiting for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> to go to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> and my little suitcase was stolen. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Did I say that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">QUESTION:  Uh uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">18
ANSWER:  Okay, well my uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> gave me a lovely, nice black patent leather, little overnight case with red leather lining. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And anything what I had valuable which people gave me, maybe jewelry and I can’t remember, as presents or Sandy’s sister has given me certain things from her mom, was in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And I held onto it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I took care of all my belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And when we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and a second uncle of Sandy and his son, waited for me and came with us to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And by then I felt I don’t have to watch that much anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I think I just didn’t take care of my things as much. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And when they were putting the things into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> ... I didn’t have that much belonging, but that little black suitcase was missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So somebody as we were talking right next to the, on the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> waiting for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> to come, must have picked it up and they stole it. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And that disappointed me tremendously, because I thought this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> 1s very safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">Things like that, it would not happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Because Sandy always used to write to me that they put a 25 cents down near the newspaper and nobody takes that 25 cents and you can just get your paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So, I thought no crime is happening in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And that was one of my disappointments. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">The other one was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> and I had to be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And he also wrote to me that the uncle had a black, they had a black maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And he said to me that, you know, you gotta be, if you are going to meet her... because I’ve never seen black people. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And he just kind of tried to make me realize that, well, we were very liberal, in all this, in our upbringing, and Sandy was too, that you got to be very nice and not make difference between a black and a white. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And then when I met her, of course, she was very nice, but that was the first time I ever seen a black person, but I was already warned by Sandy that you got to be very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">They’re just like whites and they can’t help that they’re persecuted and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So, I was prepared for all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And I tell you, in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> , I was terribly disappointed at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I met a young couple, Jewish couple, who invited us to their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And I don’t know where they are now and they seemed like they were prejudiced against blacks from their talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And I couldn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">I could not understand it as of today, and I know there are very many Jewish people who are prejudiced towards blacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Now, I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I couldn’t believe that anybody who 1s persecuted themselves, how can they be prejudiced towards somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And that was another disappointment in my life that I couldn’t understand that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">QUESTION:  That was the first ttme you had been confronted directly with that kind of person?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">ANSWER:  That was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , so that was several years after. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">At the <span class="BUILDING">Bloomington campus</span> there were black people. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And... but when somebody would make a remark like that, it was some sort of prejudice remark and I was very surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I didn’t know that Jews could be prejudiced, but I know they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I mean they could be, but it surprised me very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">When you said, “How did you take, were you satisfied with everything in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="705">Mainly, yes, but little things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">That it’s not as free and not as honest as I thought the way they were described to me at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">QUESTION:  Let me ask you, you had, you had come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and begun to kind of settle down and live more of a normal in quotes, life...
ANSWER:  Well, not very normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , yes, we had couple of <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and we worked hard to get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Little <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="710">But when we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> , <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> , that’s when we had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> , because he would have liked to get <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> for married couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">But they were hard to 19 get. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">They were not available all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">So, I stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> with a friend of his for a few weeks after he already had to be in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> by September. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And I had a baby by then, my son, Andy, was born May the 4", 1948. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">And when did you come to talk to me last time here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">QUESTION:  It was maybe a couple of months ago?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="717">ANSWER:  Was it after January or was it before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">QUESTION:  After.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">ANSWER:  Did I tell you that my son died?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">QUESTION:  No, I don’t think you did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">ANSWER:  My oldest, this one, I’m just talking about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">QUESTION:  Oh, I’m sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">ANSWER:  That was, that’s why I wondered if it was after January, then you had to be here before January, because I would have mentioned it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">But I’m not sure when you were here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="725">QUESTION:  I don’t remember either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="726">ANSWER:  So, anyway my son was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">His name was Andy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">QUESTION:  Was he named after your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  Yes, kind of, because my brother’s name was Andras. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">In our family, cousins and so on, I don’t know why, but so many people name their children... in <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> it’s Andres, in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> it was Andras and in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> it was Andrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">But I started it. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I named him Andrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">His middle name was Allen. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">So, I stayed with a young couple for a few weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , and Sandy had to be already, not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , 1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">He had to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And the only thing he could get was that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">So, he didn’t want me to stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> that long, and so I think I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , at that time <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> were more popular, with my baby, who was five months old when we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">QUESTION:  And you lived in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> with a five month old baby and no running water? </span><span class="sentence" id="739">How did you manage?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">ANSWER:  Well, that is where I am tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I never thought that a baby should not have a bath, so every single day I would go and get the water, put it in that little bitty sink... that whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> was not as big as this <span class="DLF">porch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Not really.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  And I don’t know whether the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> is even interested in that kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I just tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">One section of it was that if you opened the <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> , gosh that made a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="748">That’s what we slept on. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Then the middle part was just a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sink</span> , a tiny, little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sink</span> and some sort of a <span class="DLF">cooking facility</span> , tiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And the third part of it was, it was kind of those round top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="751">The <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> , I heard, bought them all from somewhere for a dollar apiece. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And we paid 25 dollars for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">The third part was just big enough for a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">crib</span> , so I don’t think it was as big as this. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Might have been half of the size. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I was very... I accepted that, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And you know, I used to think, well now I’m free and I’m not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">Some people wouldn’t have lived like that, they rented an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> maybe, <span class="BUILDING">housing place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Then they complained all the time that the landlady told them that they use too much water and they have the lights on too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And we were kind of feeling that we do whatever we want in that little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And so that was somewhat our own, 25 dollars, all utilities included. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">You couldn’t go any better. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And Sandy was making, getting some kind of a, you know he was on the G.I. Bill. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And then in <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> he did some sort of a little extra work. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">So, the G.I. Bill paid his tuition. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Maybe he got a hundred twenty-five dollars or whatever, 150 dollars a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">So the 25 dollars was for rent and then we lived on the rest of it. (</span><span class="sentence" id="767">Laughing.) </span><span class="sentence" id="768">But again I just accepted things better than a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">My God, if I would see my friends’ children now living under that condition, they would think, “My God, I can’t live like that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="770">But we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Then we moved into another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> which was a little taller and we didn’t bump our heads all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Might have mentioned it, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And then we got a <span class="INT_SPACE">Hoosier Court apartment</span> , where we had two <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and it was normal, for $42.50. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And that’s where we lived then all during the time we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">QUESTION:  A couple of questions, one is you talked a little bit about how you felt, and there were a few examples of how you were kind of hiding your Jewish identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">You had your number removed, your Auschwitz number removed from your arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And you talked about how when you were working at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Garfinkels</span> you didn’t, you didn’t want to talk...
ANSWER:  I worried because I, see now I can talk to anybody and I don’t care, you know, that I would be denying my religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">At that time, I worried, you know, what could be the consequences of that? </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Or I mentioned that, maybe in Mary K.’s interview, but I will say when we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> and we lived in the South end, so that was in 1953. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in ‘45, so that was almost eight years after. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And we had a neighbor next door, she took me around, showed me the <span class="DLF">Iroquois Park</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="782">It’s a pretty <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">They had a child my son’s, Andy’s age. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And she asked me what <span class="BUILDING">church</span> I go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And I told her, “I don’t go to any <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , I’m Jewish.” </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And I said it without any worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">But I thought to myself, if she still will speak to me after this, I’m okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">If not...? </span><span class="sentence" id="789">See, and that was eight years after that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">QUESTION:  What about your own relationship with Judaism? </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Did you do anything to, any, go to services?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="792">ANSWER:  I’m not, not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> , <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">It went through my mind a lot of times, what so many other refugees might have told you, maybe not, some people might have gotten more religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Some people might have had some doubts. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Where was God when all this happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="796">So that went through my mind a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Now, Sandy’s family was Orthodox and they were very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">21 When he came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , he asked his uncle, the first Rosh Hashanah, that he would like to go to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And the uncle, since he was married to a non-Jewish person, said, “Ill ask a friend of mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">He’ll pick you up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Well, in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , when you went to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , you first of all didn’t go by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">You couldn’t drive on that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">So, somebody picked him up and took him to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">It was not a, it was not a Conservative one. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And maybe the men did not wear hats, maybe they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">The men and the women were together, not like in... even where I belong to... his family was, they were Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Mine were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">But in our <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the women sit upstairs and the men sit downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">So, he was very, very disappointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">An organ in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , music, I mean everything, just what he never had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And somehow it didn’t remind him of anything he remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And that turned him off somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I mean, maybe shouldn’t have, but it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">So some people could be considered very religious and they keep it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">He didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">When I came out to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , we did not belong to anything, at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And I somehow didn’t miss it, but when my kids were getting to be <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> age, and that was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> , then we did join a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">QUESTION:  Which one did you join?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">ANSWER:  At that time it was called B’rith Sholom. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">It was not a Conservative. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">But we did, because I felt like the kids ought to have some Jewish background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">QUESTION:  It was not Conservative? </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Is that what you said? </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Or it was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="825">ANSWER:  Let’s see, which 1s the least religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">QUESTION:  Oh, Reform?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="827">ANSWER:  Reformed. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">It was Reformed. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Conservative is more religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">But there you would go and it was the type, again, it reminded me more of a Protestant type of <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="831">You know, it was just so strange to me and of course everything was in English and very little in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">But we belonged there and I went to the holidays and took the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">But since we did not observe it, the way some, and I don’t know how religious your family is, so I’m not comparing myself to anybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I’m just telling it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Therefore I didn’t expect my children to become that religious either. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I took them to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> , because I felt like they should have that background. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">But the <span class="BUILDING">Sunday schools</span> at that time, at least where we belonged, was not anything that I would think desirable. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">The teachers were just volunteer people. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">The discipline was not very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">The kids could do anything they wanted to and if they left Sunday school and they walked over to an <span class="BUILDING">ice cream place</span> and they came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I would hear stories like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And that disappointed me, because it didn’t leave any impression on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Now, the <span class="BUILDING">Sunday schools</span> now that, let me see, my daughter, Linda, is married to a Jewish guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And they do belong and I do too, now, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Temple Shalom</span> , which is actually one branch of the B’rith Sholom, which long time ago closed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And Adath Israel and <span class="BUILDING">B’rith Sholom</span> merged and it became the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> , which is a big and fancy one and a lot of rich people belong there. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Temple Shalom</span> is a lot more Reformed and we do like our rabbi very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And I go on High Holy days. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I don’t go that often, but he’s a real nice guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And Linda’s kids go to <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">And the teachers are nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">They learn a lot more and they like to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">My kids didn’t like to go, because they just didn’t get anything out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And I’m sorry about that, but that’s the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">Now, my son- 22 in-law here, Mark, actually even teaches <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> at that same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And I felt like I wanted to join. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">Sandy wouldn’t have cared either way. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I said, now in my older age, I kind of felt like... because I’m not so religious, but I have my, a traditional background, which you can never ever get out of your system. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">So, it’s not the same as the way I remember the high holidays in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Everything was in Hebrew and I remember on Yom Kippur, I would go and visit my family while they were sitting, all day long at the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="860">We were not Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">We didn’t keep kosher, so... and I like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Because I knew a lot of religious people who... like in Sandy’s family maybe they didn’t eat in their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but they would go out and eat stuff that they really shouldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Or Mark’s family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> , they were very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">They kept kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">When they come to visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , we would go out for dinner and absolutely never failed that the father would not order maybe bacon or ham or that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And I felt like that’s kind of, you know, it’s not really true. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">Either you keep it or you don’t keep it. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">They were very nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">They’re both dead now and I liked them very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">But my family wasn’t like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">We ate anything and we weren’t... and I kind of like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I don’t know whether you’re religious or not, very religious or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">QUESTION:  How did you get from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">ANSWER:  Well, we were living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> from 1948 to 1951. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">My daughter, actually she’s coming tomorrow from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Seattle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="876">She was born in 1950 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Andy was born in Washington, D.C. ‘51 we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marion</span> , <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> and spent one year there. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And I might have told that to Mary K. Sandy was having to do his internship in Psychology at the <span class="BUILDING">VA Hospital</span> , so we lived there for one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">The rents over there were a lot more expensive now than in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> on the <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="880">And his pay was a little bit more, but not very much and I had two kids by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And many of the wives of the people who were there on internship, did some work at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">And I wanted to do some work myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">And there was a <span class="BUILDING">glass factory</span> , the Forbes. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">They manufactured all kinds of bottles, just beer bottles, little bottles and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And I got a job there. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">I never done that kind of work, but I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And I went to work at six o’clock in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">He came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">VA</span> at 4:30. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">So, he took care of the kids and I went to work at six and came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at midnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">QUESTION:  My goodness.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="891">ANSWER:  And that was kind of hard work, but again I wanted to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And the only reason I wanted to do it because I wanted a couple of things that I felt like I can’t afford. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I wanted an ironing board, which happened to be the Mary Proctor ironing board, which was expensive at the time and actually not very long ago it finally broke on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And Sandy would have liked to have a good camera, so I decided I would work, because nothing extra like that we would have had enough money. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">I’ll work for a month or two, I thought, but then I couldn’t leave the work. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And I worked all the way until it was time for us to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I can’t remember what the pay was. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I do know that it was really cold in winter time, because you had <span class="DLF">assembly lines</span> and close to a <span class="DLF">door</span> and it was freezing. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And it would have, have you ever seen a Charlie Chaplin movie, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="900">Like where the best part of my work was when there was something wrong with the <span class="DLF">assembly line</span> and the machine stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And there would be a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Otherwise you just had to constantly pick up the bottles, check them for a minute, like this, and put them in a box. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And you could not stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Then somebody would be coming and relieve you in order to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">restroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And I did 23 that from all the way till the end of our staying there, which was sometimes in the middle of summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> , <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> , because he had to get his Ph.D. See that was just a year internship. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Not much to be told about that year. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">You know, I had two kids and I worked and he worked, so not much was happening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">QUESTION:  Did you experience any anti-Semitism at all during that period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">ANSWER:  No, not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">But I don’t think in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marion</span> , yet, I talked to anybody about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">First of all, we knew a few people, but we didn’t make too many friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And the subject never came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And I was so busy with the kids that, you know, I didn’t talk about it, or... I remember we were renting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marion</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">National home</span> for 92 dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And I was sick one time with strep throat. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And Sandy got a call somewhere about some pay raise, something. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And he got so excited and he was doing the laundry. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And we had some sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">washing machine</span> that you had to stop it in between all the periods. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And suddenly the water overflowed and the water was coming all over the whole <span class="BUILDING">National home</span> , you know, it’s... I don’t know if you know what they are like. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">They are pre-fab <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , so they’re not very super, but it was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">It was like a two or three bedroom little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a modern <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">It was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">So then not much happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marion</span> and we went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> , <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And we bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="925">That was our first time that we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="926">And I learned, actually practiced, how to drive at the <span class="BUILDING">VA</span> , because it was just a nice big <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> that no traffic. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">But my real experience for learning how to drive was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> , <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="928">For five dollars, we got like a course, and I learned how to drive, but since we didn’t have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , I couldn’t practice it. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">So, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marion</span> we did have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I practiced how to drive. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">And I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bloomington</span> , <span class="REGION">Indiana</span> , I got my license. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">End of Tape 2, Side A 24 Tape 2, Side B
QUESTION:  This is tape number two, side B.
ANSWER:  So then we... how did we get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , your question was. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">A friend of Sandy’s heard about a job and he was offered that job. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">It was a post-doctoral fellowship at the <span class="BUILDING">Child Guidance Clinic</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And his name was Fred Kanfer and he was more an experimental psychologist, not a clinical psychologist. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">And he did not want the job and he mentioned it to Sandy. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And so he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> and he applied for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And he got that job at the <span class="BUILDING">Child Guidance Clinic</span> , which was for one year only. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">And that was kind of very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">We lived in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in the South end, it’s where I met the person, who I first felt like, she still must like me, even so that she found out that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Now that was many years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And the people at the <span class="BUILDING">Child Guidance Clinic</span> were very, very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">They are all older social workers or psychiatrists or psychologists. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">They practically took us in like a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">They had lot of family get-togethers. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And we didn’t go out otherwise. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Because then my daughter was born, Linda was born, in 1954. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">So we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> in ‘53 and we still lived in the South end when she was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And our assignment was only for one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And now my story is really important here, but I couldn’t see myself moving in September when she was supposed to born in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And we didn’t have much money because that pay was, you know, quite little. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">And our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> at the <span class="INT_SPACE">Washington Park apartments</span> was already then eighty-two dollars and ninety-five cents or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">We had to pay utilities, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">So I told Sandy just anything he could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">And by then I could walk to the <span class="BUILDING">grocery</span> , because it was right behind our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I could walk, we had one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , I could walk to the <span class="BUILDING">pediatrician</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And I never did anything else, like go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or do that kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">And I said, “I wish we could stay just at least maybe for one more year, so we don’t have to move just exactly in September.” </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Because they usually would have seminars and then people would go to those seminars and then people come with job opportunities. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">So Sandy would have had to go to one of those things and find a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And we would have had to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">Well, it was very, very hard even for me to imagine and so, the <span class="BUILDING">Child Guidance Clinic</span> gave him a part time job. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norton</span> he worked part time and in one other <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> it was part time. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I mean, just very little, here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Then he met two psychiatrists, who needed somebody and they became our friends, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And they needed somebody who would do some testing for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And they offered him to try and see if he would like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And he tried it and they offered him a nice salary and that’s how we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="968">He worked with them for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And those psychiatrists are still alive and they are very nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">We’re still friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">And Linda was born in ‘54, so I didn’t have to move away. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And then we stayed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> until 1957. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And we were looking for a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we found this and we have been here ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="974">QUESTION:  What year was that, that you moved here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="975">ANSWER:  1957. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">So, from ‘53 to ‘57 we lived there. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">At that time, I didn’t have my fourth child, yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Now there is, if you have any questions about our stay here, you can ask me. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">And then... but you ask me, because I don’t know what you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">25
QUESTION:  I wondered about when you first arrived and you talked about, you mentioned a little earlier, you had a taken a walk through <span class="DLF">Iroquois Park</span> and so forth, and it occurred to me that at that time, <span class="DLF">Iroquois Park</span> was segregated and black people, I think, were not...
ANSWER:  Was it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="981">QUESTION:  Yeah, I read something about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">I was wondering if you noticed segregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> and whether that, because you had mentioned earlier that 1t made an impression on you that black people were treated differently than whites.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="983">ANSWER:  Tell me, when was the Civil Right Movement and the Martin Luther King, and when... you know I’ve been watching those programs all the time, but I don’t remember the dates. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">When was it that finally, really, for example, black people didn’t have to sit on the back of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and all that? </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Do you remember dates like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="986">QUESTION:  It was different in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , and I’m not sure exactly for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="987">But probably mid- 1960s, early 1960s.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="988">ANSWER:  Because I remember the Civil Rights movements in the ‘60s. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I didn’t, it didn’t leave any special impression with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">I didn’t go anywhere much, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">I was very busy with the kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And I didn’t even watch, well we didn’t have any television at that time, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">It was later. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And when you get busy, I spend a lot more time now, listening to the news and being involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">But I was a very conscientious mother and there was just a lot to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">By then I had three kids and you know, diapers and just... I was very, very busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">And since Sandy worked, day and very many times in the evening, he wasn’t really that much of a help. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">He couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">In summertime we would go one vacation, we did every year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">Because his uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">summer home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annapolis</span> , <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> and he offered for us to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">So, we would leave in the evening and drive all night to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annapolis</span> by next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">And we would spend two weeks there, which was again, some mothers might have been complaining about it, but I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">It wasn’t really that easy on me, because, you know, I did the cooking and it wasn’t a luxury. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">But the kids had a good time, you know, Sandy would take them out and they would fish and maybe they go on a boat ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">But Linda was still a baby, so I was really more like a mom over there, than it was a really exciting vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">So, we had done that for many years, till my youngest one was two years old, and then they sold that <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">But no, I did not remember anything that I was that worried about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">And when we come to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> maybe, you might like to... and I will have a really important story, too, about my oldest son, Andy, who... the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was nearby us here, where we live even now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">That’s where he went to <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1010">QUESTION:  What was the name of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1011">ANSWER:  Belknap, <span class="BUILDING">Belknap Elementary School</span> , which is no longer existing, the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is there, but no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">And all my kids went to that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">Then, we, well in the South end, I’m sorry we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">Andy went to, isn’t that funny, I forgot the name of it, now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">There was an <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">And he was in fourth grade when we moved here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">And my youngest daughter, I mean Elizabeth was two years younger, so she went to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And the name would come to me later, but I don’t think it’s that important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">So in here, since we lived all our life here, 26 let me just talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">They went to <span class="BUILDING">Belknap Elementary School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And then to, and Andy finished here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">He was in sixth grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">And he met some really nice friends on our <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">Then they went to Highland Junior High School. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">Now, the friend, who we met here and became friendly with Andy was two years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Non-Jewish people, he was very liberal type. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And he started a club. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">I don’t know how much you know about social clubs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">We belonged to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">Sandy was pretty against those things, but he always said, I wish they would ask them and I wish they could refuse it, meaning, you know... because he had problems, you know, as a child psychologist with kids, they’re so upset and depressed over that they were not included in one of those clubs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">And those social clubs were horrible things, but they existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">So, my kids were invited to it, but they weren’t terribly active at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Community Center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">For example, they had those, it’s really not important to even talk about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">But Andy’s friend started a new club. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">It was called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Princeton</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">And there was no question that blacks should not be a part of it or Jews should not be part of it, he was that kind of a kid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1037">QUESTION:  You mean there was no question, that of course blacks should be part of 1t?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1038">ANSWER:  They should be part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">I mean his was an integrated club and that was his main concern, that anybody, Jews or blacks should be able to... whether they did or not, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">But Andy was Jewish and he was part of that club. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">So, he finished, that was <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> and I cannot talk forever about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">Then he went to <span class="BUILDING">Atherton High School</span> and he finished that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And he was in the marching band, but he never liked to wear uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">He had had to, would have, but they were just kind of... that psychiatrist’s son, who gave Sandy the job, he had a son Andy’s age. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">And they were together in the marching band. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And they would carry their uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">They wouldn’t be caught dead putting it on and go like that. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1048">ll try to make that all brief. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">He graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in 1966 and went away to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> to <span class="BUILDING">Lawrence University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Appleton</span> , <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">He left in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">I got him all ready, with clothes and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">By then I had my youngest one, who was six years old, because he was born in 1960...
QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1053">ANSWER:  Robert, the younger one, who is now living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Well, my big tragedy comes now, that in September he moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Appleton</span> , <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Friday before Thanksgiving in November, Sandy left, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> to a psychological meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">I was just cleaning up all the leaves in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , got a call from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Appleton</span> that Andy was in an accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Well, what happened, that they lived on the <span class="BUILDING">dorm</span> ... and there was a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , which was already barricaded and people didn’t go in there, but sometimes they did, with the idea boys will be boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">One of Andy’s friends asked him if he wouldn’t mind coming up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">And Andy says, “Oh, I’ve been there last week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">I don’t want to go.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1061">Oh, come on, I don’t want to go by myself.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">That kid wanted a light bulb. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">I mean silly thing, it doesn’t make any sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">They went up into the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">It was barricaded, but people went in all the time, because it was kind of like a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And they were way up high and he stepped on a false <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> , that was... he was in the front and the boy was behind him and he fell through, 35 feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And I got the phone call. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">They wanted me to say that anything they can do, that I should give my... I said my husband was out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">So I want to make that story kind of short, but it was...
QUESTION:  What year? </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">27
ANSWER:  It was in 1966 in November. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">So, I got into my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , quick went over to that psychiatrist friend of ours, who was just recuperating from pneumonia. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">I told him quick what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">He was trying to reach Sandy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">He called the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">He told them, they do whatever they need to do. (</span><span class="sentence" id="1076">Coughs.) </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">Stop it now for a minute, I’m going to get some...
QUESTION:  Go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1078">ANSWER:  The reason this is important, because at that time when this happened, I thought to myself, the Holocaust was enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And I didn’t expect to have another something like this to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">But I handled that pretty well, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">But I remember when the telephone calls were done and my friend’s wife offered that she’ll come with me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Appleton</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And I said, well maybe that’s not necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">We left John Bell, Dr. Bell 1s the psychiatrist who reached Sandy at the <span class="BUILDING">Atlanta airport</span> and he turned right back around on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">So my friend, his wife, took me to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> and we felt if he will be on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> that we were supposed to be taking, then Nancy would not come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">In the meantime, I had to leave my six year old son, Linda was ten and Elizabeth was twelve. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">But at that time, Sandy has a sister, whose daughter just graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , who was Andy’s age. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">And she came to stay with us for a whole year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">And that was the year that she was staying here, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buenos Aires</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And she had a hard time to adjust, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">She was very homesick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">But at that time she already decided she’s staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">Now, she was a, she was, she liked to cook, and she was... well, I had a help in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> too, not all the time, but a couple times a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">So, I just packed my stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">I remember the kids all standing next to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And I thought about cold weather and warm weather and I packed my suitcase. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">And with her, with Kathy being here, who is 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">No, I’m sorry, Elizabeth was sixteen and Linda was twelve and Robert was six. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">So, anyway, I said, “I just have to leave.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And I was hoping that everything will turn out okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">And I’m still seeing the kids standing there, they were, you know, of course terribly worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And I went to the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">Sandy was on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> coming back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> and we flew to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Appleton</span> , <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">It was in the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">We didn’t know what we were going to find. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">And it was, you know, really heartbreaking in a way, and we... somebody took us into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and Andy was under all kind of wires. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">And he was in a coma actually for about three days, completely out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And Sandy stayed with me until he was coming to, and... not that he was better, but he was not in a coma anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">And one very important story I must tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">The day we arrived, of course there was an article in that, in the Appleton paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">And somebody called the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and wanted to meet the parents of this young boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And that was a Catholic family, a mother and a father, who had also four children, but they were already older and out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And they came to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and not even knowing me or Sandy, they offered their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">They lived pretty close to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">That I could stay with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And they were wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And now see, something like that makes me cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">I was there for six weeks and I could walk from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">The kids were out of her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> already, so she had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">I could talk to somebody at night about how things are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">And otherwise I spent the whole day in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">See the result of all this was, that eventually, I mean, his spinal cord was injured and he became a paraplegic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">But we didn’t know that for a long time, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">I don’t know if you know anybody, when people are this sick, that for example they have movements in their leg, which is just nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">It doesn’t mean anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">But sometimes I would talk to them on the phone all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">See Sandy stayed for a little while and then he went back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">So, I talked to them on the phone all the time and 28 eventually I got, and I still have that, I never wanted to throw it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">I thought now when Andy died, then maybe I will throw it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">I can not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">I have letters and letters and letters people wrote to me, to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And I still have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">In fact, just a little while ago, I re-read them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">I never, never could open those letters until just recently. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And they were helping with the kids and they were bringing food for them and you know, they were... the kids were wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">They were behaving very nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And so, I was there for six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">At Christmas time or holiday time, they came, all of them, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Appleton</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And that’s the only time we stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , because this family, named Alice and Art, children came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for the holidays and there was not enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">But that made it so much easier for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And of course, I couldn’t sleep well and I got some tranquilizers from this psychiatrist doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">Which even maybe even two pills couldn’t make me relax enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">But I there again was... I don’t think I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">I was under tremendous tension all the time, and not knowing what the outcome will be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">Appleton was finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">Finally we decided that we can bring him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">So, with an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> we brought him <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And of course, he couldn’t sit up or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I mean, it was... he was paralyzed from waist down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">But at that time he wasn’t absolutely sure about it, but they gave him a final test. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">And the final test showed that the spinal cord was completely severed, so injured, and that doesn’t look like, you know, it can be ever... but making the story short, we put him here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , which at that time was the <span class="BUILDING">St. Anthony Hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">We had a friend who was that kind of doctor who dealt with this kind of injuries, except... he was a wonderful man, he was a friend, but he didn’t know enough about the whole deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">Because I remember we were very disappointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">The <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , like the orderly put him, in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , put him on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and left him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">I mean his back was... he shouldn’t have done that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">He was there for six weeks and at the very end, our friend, the psychiatrist, made arrangements at the <span class="BUILDING">Rusk Institute</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">That they can transfer him there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Which they did, and just very briefly, before they left, a nurse offered, private nurse will stay with us for the weekend, before Andy goes, because Andy wanted to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for the weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">Well, that woman was absolutely, she should have never been a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">She tried to show, she said that she had a daughter who had polio and that daughter of hers walked after a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">She kept on telling Andy, if you have faith, you will be walking again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">Well, she should have never said that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And then we were over here in that weekend in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">She made him, with crutches and braces, stand above behind the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And Kathy, who 1s a big, heavyset girl, sat in the <span

braces, he couldn’t walk, but she made him stand up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">So, then he sat in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> and he says, “Boy that feels good.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And the nurse says, “Maybe it feels good for you, but it’s not... maybe it feels good, but it’s not good for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">And Andy says, “Maybe it’s not good for me, but it still feels good.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And the woman got so angry, that came out to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and says, “I’m leaving.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And I went out to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> ... yes, I did cry then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">I gave her the check, what I owed her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">And I couldn’t believe it, he was sitting in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">And Sandy calls <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , “How is everything going?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">And I says, whatever the nurse’s name was, she left. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1176">I’ll be right <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">So, he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we had some real good friends, who are still our friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">He used to be our family doctor and his wife, and Doctor Eskind and his wife came over because they knew Andy’s going to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">And they wanted to say good-bye to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">And Andy’s sitting in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I tell them the whole story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">They couldn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And finally Sandy and Harold Eskind help him down... we have all those steps... helped him down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And Harold says, “Pll come over tomorrow morning.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">See she was supposed to be here and help us getting him ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">I mean, you know, with a paraplegic, it takes a long time to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">And 29 Harold said, “Pll come over early in the morning, because I’m not sure when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> was leaving.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">And we said, “Oh don’t worry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">We’ll just get up an hour earlier,” or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And Robert that night, who was only six, slept in the <span class="INT_SPACE">TV room</span> right opposite of our <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I mean, he was upset and he was worried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">And he woke up with a hundred and four fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And so, as I said, loud, I said, ““God, we sure could use Doctor Eskind now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">And as I said that, apparently our <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> was open and he did come anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">And he was walking in and he says, “Here Iam.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">That was, you know, like an angel coming from <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">He helped us get, he helped us getting Andy ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">He gave Robert a shot, I think, whatever he needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">I didn’t go with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">It was only Sandy and Andy who flew to... the <span class="BUILDING">Ruskin Institute</span> did marvels. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">He was there for six weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">Luckily his mind was completely well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">They taught him how to drive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">They taught him how to get dressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">They taught him complete independency. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">And Andy used to be a very stubborn kid as a young person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">When he wanted to do something, he wanted to do it right then. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">And that helped him tremendously in his accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">Of course, he decided and I have a beautiful paper, which he wrote, then later he... I don’t want to jump ahead of myself, but he learned how to do all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">He got acar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">It had a hand control. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And he was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the first year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">He used to have a girlfriend from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Myrtle Beach</span> from before his accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">He says he wants to visit her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">And we begged him, it’s too early, yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">I mean he... all by himself to go to <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span> or wherever the girl lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">He says, “If I would know that I’m going to walk next year, I would wait, but since I know I’m not going to, I want to do it right now.” _</span><span class="sentence" id="1218">He got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , he drove over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">I said, “Please call us the minute you get there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">He did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">So, anyway he was really unbelievably... you know, I still say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">Then he went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lawrence</span> , he went back to <span class="BUILDING">Lawrence University</span> for a semester. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And he did very well, but it got very cold there in <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> and the snow was so high, that he couldn’t even get out of his <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> to get to the, like to the classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">So, Sandy sent somebody, a young man, who moved him back and he was transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">To the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> where the climate is different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">So, he went back there and he finished <span class="BUILDING">college</span> in three and a half years, instead of four. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">I mean, he made up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">And in summer time, he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chapel Hill</span> , <span class="REGION">North Carolina</span> and spent <span class="BUILDING">summer school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">And one summer he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , just for a semester. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">So, he made up all his lost time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">He finished and then he moved out to <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">He was very independent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">He did everything on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">And in the beginning, he didn’t really want to come back that much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">I think the memories and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">For example, he was fighting that we shouldn’t put an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">He didn’t want us to move and we didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">We tried to put an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevator</span> in, but with this split-level it wasn’t that easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And when he would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he was so matter of fact of anybody who wanted to help him, lift him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">I mean, he got used to the idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">Then he decided he’s going to go to <span class="BUILDING">Social Work school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And he applied to Kent Social Work School (ph) and that’s when he wrote...

ANSWER:  I had a Hungarian friend, who was pretty neurotic and she was supposedly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> maybe for a month and then she was taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">We didn’t really talk too much about it, but I didn’t have really close contacts with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">Then I had another Jewish friend, she died too, in the meantime, who survived the Nazism in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">Hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">And that’s a different way of doing it there, you know, that like the Anne Frank. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">So we once in a while talked about it, but we did not talk about this like all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">And I don’t know how the other people, who now I see them once a year, when we have this... either at the <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> or at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Community</span> ... every year it is somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">Where they have the Shoah, July, no not in July. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">They usually have it here, somehow in May. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">We had ours just not too long ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">And in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> they have one, always, exactly the time when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was evacuated and taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">Then in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> they have a big... and I’ve never been there at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">And then people come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , people who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> before, I mean in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Eger</span> before, who had relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">They would come to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">But, no I really don’t have any contact with any of the other Holocaust survivors here.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1474">QUESTION:  ...to see the other people...
ANSWER:  No, not that, it’s for me, that’s one way for me to remember my parents and my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">That’s one way, like some people light candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">Some people can go to a <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">In fact, when Andy died, they cremated his body and it came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">And there was a question, how and where? </span><span class="sentence" id="1479">There is a beautiful <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> here, it’s <span class="DLF">Cave Hill Cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">And I didn’t know that Jewish people can be buried there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">But it’s a beautiful <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">In Spring it is beautiful, in Fall it’s beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">There is a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> , a lot of sculptures all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">And it’s just that people come and visit without visiting any <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">And I’ve heard that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Temple Shalom</span> has a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">When I heard that, I figured, well Jews must be... and then I had some friends whose husbands are buried there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">And we decided we’re going to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">And Rabbi Miles... Robert by then wasn’t <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but my daughter, Elizabeth was here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">And we went out to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and we did a private funeral for him with Rabbi Miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">Then at that time he didn’t have a marker yet, but then several months later, not several months, maybe a couple of months later, I got a call from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">By the way, the girl who is in charge of that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , has been working there for twenty-five years and she is Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">She knew Rabbi Miles very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">She was very, very nice and helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">And we ordered a marker and that’s there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">Now, in fact, when Robert was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at Fourth of July weekend, we went out there, and he looked at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">And I’m sure... my daughter is coming tomorrow for just ten days and we will go out and I took a picture of that marker. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">It says, Andrew Allen Klein, above it “Andy” and the date that he was born and the day that he died and there is a little menorah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">35
QUESTION:  That makes me think of a question which may seem a little odd. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">But you don’t have a <span class="DLF">grave</span> to visit for your parents or for most of the members of your family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">Does that make it important to you to have that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1501">ANSWER:  That’s why I wanted Andy to be here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1502">QUESTION:  And what about for yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1503">ANSWER:  Oh, well, if you’re really interested in that, Sandy used to be the type of guy who would say, I want my ashes in the <span class="DLF">parks</span> and in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">When this happened, we never talked to Andy about what he wants. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">We never thought that he’s going to die before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">The girl, I forgot her name now, at the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> says... she wasn’t pressuring anybody, but she says, “Many times people don’t think about it now, but later on suddenly they think they would like to be maybe near a dear one from the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">And then there is no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for it.””, </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">And she just thought she’d mention. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">I kept on thinking and thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">And Sandy’s sister was here at the time from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">And I said to her, “You know I really would...” I thought about it a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">When we die, Linda and will the family just throw our ashes... I thought about this, but I never made a big deal about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">So I said to Sandy one day, “You know, I wouldn’t mind to get two lots next to Andy’s.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">And he didn’t object to it and we did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">So we have him and then two empty lots, which we paid for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">And we, of course, would like to be cremated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">I mean a long time ago, I decided. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">So now I feel good, that at least I know what our kids need to do with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1519">QUESTION:  Do you think that is a special comfort to you because...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1520">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1521">QUESTION:  ...your parents, you don’t have <span class="NPIP">places</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1522">ANSWER:  And I thought, see, we went out on Andy’s birthday for example. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">I mean I’m not the type, who would going out every week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">But it gives me a comfort to know that he is here and he’s close to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">And now that we decided to do this, and in fact Robert was kind of, almost funny... “Let’s all get a <span class="NPIP">place</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">And I said, “I don’t know,” but we do, and if they do that... I mean Sandy will be eighty years old next year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">Eventually we will die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">I mean, we’re in fairly good health. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">At least it makes me feel good, first of all that we belong to a <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> , secondly that if our kids want to visit our <span class="DLF">graves</span> , since we cannot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">I don’t know where my brothers are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">I don’t know where his parents are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">It does make me, give me a comfort. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">And I’m not sure why, but it does. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">And I’m glad that he agreed on this, because I thought he’s going to give me a hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">And then the kids, what are they going to do with us? </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">Throw our ashes all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">And I don’t know where my brothers are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">I don’t, I mean I know where my parents are, but we can’t visit them ever, and so, anyway.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1540">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">I never visited <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but I did visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , one time when we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">He wanted to go and I went with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">We took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">There were a bunch of people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , young students. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">And it did come up that I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">And they asked me questions, but it 36 somehow, again... I didn’t cry there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">It just was so manicured and it looked so different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">And we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , last summer, with an elder hostel group and there were hardly any Jews in that group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">But they had planned to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mauthausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">And we did that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">And I saw there the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">Well of... it’s hard for me to explain it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">It’s almost like that’s not me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">You know, it’s almost like I couldn’t have been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">I mean I know I was, but I just, that’s the way, maybe, it’s easier for me to deal with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">I just can’t imagine how anybody can go through it and then be here to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">And I’m not the only one, a lot of people who... and it was, you know, the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , I peeked into some of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">But, you know, I mean, it was so much worse than when I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">I mean when I was there it was so horrible, that any of this thing now, which is a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , it’s just, it’s hard to imagine that people really were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">But that was at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau camp</span> , where I went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">Some people, German people were sitting next to the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> , in their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> with flowers and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">And I would walk by them and they looked maybe old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">And I used to think at that time, I wonder what they knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">How much they knew? </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">Did they know what’s going on in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">Stuff like that goes through my mind all the time, even now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">And Sandy gets very... if he runs into somebody who’s old and maybe it would be a German, then he would never trust them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">He would think he might have been a Nazi or whatever, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">So, you never can get that out of your system. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">But slowly we are getting older and not that many people... and that’s why I talk to many <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">And that’s why I’m doing this, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">That I think there ought to be a way of people to know what happened really, after we die. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">Because there are not that many people left who survived it, slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">I’m seventy-seven years old and young people were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">I’m not saying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> or some of those <span class="NPIP">places</span> , because families were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">And a young person might live to be 90, and still... but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> there were no kids, not one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1577">QUESTION:  Did you ever have the desire to visit <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1578">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">I... we went to see Schindler’s List and I saw it a couple times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">And then from the <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> , people went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">And somebody interviewed us, but there were some young people in the group and one girl said that she visited... I think her grandparents might have been survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">And she went to visit some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">And I said, “What did it look like?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">And she says, “It has a <span class="BUILDING">souvenir shop</span> , you can buy all these things.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1585">No, I really don’t have the desire to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1586">I see it on movies or on film. </span><span class="sentence" id="1587">And it must look so different, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1588">I remember the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> as we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">I remember that incident where Mengele was turning you, sending you to the right or the left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">I remember the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> at the time, but now it’s probably, looks completely different.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1608">QUESTION:  Did there come a point when you felt that you had to talk about your experiences, your memories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1609">ANSWER:  Well it came after, many years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1610">The very first time, I think I talked about it, that we were going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> , to an <span class="BUILDING">art gallery</span> , and Mary K. was with me and another friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">It was a two hour ride and somehow it came up and then I told them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">When I used to walk with neighbors and friends and they have known me forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">So, years and years ago, we would walk for maybe 45 minutes and one of my friends, not Jewish, asked me if I would talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">So, I said, “Pll be glad to,” and for many, many weeks that we would walk, we stopped at a certain point and then they wanted to know the rest of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">So, by now it doesn’t give me any problems to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">When some of the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> ask me, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">I couldn’t begin to tell you now how many times I did speak in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">Once at the <span class="BUILDING">Catherine Spalding College</span> , once at <span class="BUILDING">St. Andrews Church</span> and mainly then on Jewish situations, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">And they might have a Jewish student there or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">And now, I’m completely at ease with myself and I can talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">Once ina while I kind of get a lump in my throat, you know, but I can do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1622">QUESTION:  Did you...
ANSWER:  And I’m glad that I can, because Sandy’s sister, the one who is coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> now, she completely held it back all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">So much that if the subject comes up, she just completely bursts out crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">She couldn’t talk to her kids about it... they know... or to her grandchildren about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">And her granddaughter said, “Why don’t you make a tape of it,” because she was with me one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">Sylvia, she’s now about twenty some years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">She told her grandmother, “Why don’t you make a tape of it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">Maybe it would be easier for you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">And everybody tells this to everybody, but it’s not easy to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">I would have never just done it, if Mary K. wouldn’t have insisted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1631">QUESTION:  Was it important to you, personally to do it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1632">ANSWER:  I, I, it’s nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1633">Like, for example, I have a neighbor two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> down, who is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and who left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , they took all of her things away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1634">And she ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">I said, “Why don’t you tell your story?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">She can not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1637">And all alone, unless somebody asks you, it’s very hard to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1638">But I’m glad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1639">I am glad that I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1640">And I’m glad that there is a record of it, maybe for the future generation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1641">I mean, I don’t care whether I would have it or not, but... so, I think it’s... and that’s why they make such a big deal about that now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1642">Of course, a lot of people go back with transports to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and so I don’t have any desire to do that.</span></p>

ANSWER:  ...Democrats, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">Now if when we were younger and we would get together and like let’s see, during some of the presidential elections, we would all get together and everybody was for that same person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">We used to think everybody, like long, long time ago, Stevenson was running and we all liked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">Then he didn’t make it and we were so surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">So we don’t have any, non- liberal friends, but you run into a lot of people like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">And that doesn’t mean that we are not friendly with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">But as we get older we don’t really...

QUESTION:  When you first moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> , how did you integrate into the community here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">How did you make friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">And was it with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> only?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1669">ANSWER:  Well for a while, no, not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">We lived in the South end and we didn’t, some people through his work would come and look us up and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">When we moved to this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , then we met more and more people and they would invite us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">But we’re not the type that we congregate only that they have to be Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">As I said, that thought, if anybody would be an anti-Semitic person, I would never want to have anything to do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">But that’s not the kind of friends we ever would have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">And after, you know, I got used to the idea and everybody knows we are Jewish, I mean it’s not a problem anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">And our kids, too, they have mixture of non-Jewish friends and Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">Now, my son, Robert, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nashville</span> , he married a Catholic girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">Now, he is the least. </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">He’s the one who came with me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">And he said that he learned more about Andy during that three hour memorial service than he ever knew, because he was just a little boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">And then he got away, Andy got away, you know, went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and then he moved to Cal... so, I was very, very glad that he could come with me, that he wanted to come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">And it made a very big impression on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">We got through music or through the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> or through work, that we made friends, you know, but it.... and some of them are Jewish, some of them are not Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">So it’s... we have some very, very good friends, who we still get together sometimes, have dinner out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">He’s almost ninety years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">And on their second marriage and they’re Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">So, it’s not a matter that it has to be Jewish or not, but it has to be the same type of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1688">QUESTION:  I’m going to say something about... I have a question that I have to explain a little bit first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1689">I think and my assumption would be that most people living in <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> don’t really realize that there’s a group of Holocaust survivors who live in this state. </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">And most of the Holocaust survivors who live in the state, live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1691">And I’m wondering if you’ve had a chance or an opportunity to travel outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Louisville</span> or to talk to people who have been kind of surprised, who know that you’re a survivor... like for example, if you speak to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> groups, have you had experiences where you’ve found people, where you’ve spoken to people outside of 40 the <span class="REGION">Louisville area</span> , who maybe wouldn’t have expected that even a Holocaust survivor lives in the state?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1692">ANSWER:  Well, there’s some <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> that I’ve been speaking to, the teachers have been very, they’re mostly non-Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">A lot of them maybe half black, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">And they prepare the kids, most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1695">They had Holocaust pictures on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1696">They were studying it before they asked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">So they were somewhat, and then they would ask a lot of questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">And I did it once at Highland Junior High School. </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">There were 150 kids in the group and all 150 wrote me a thank you note about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1700">And I have all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1701">I have a box this full of all that kind of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1702">They, one black kid, for example, said, “Can I touch you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1703">I said, “Yes you can.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">And he said, “At least if somebody would say sometimes that the Holocaust did not exist, because we talked about that, at least I can say yes it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1705">Because I touched somebody who was part of it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1706">So, it made me feel good that they were thinking about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">And they hear once in a while stories where people don’t want to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1708">And that’s the only reason I’m doing it, because it would very much bother me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1709">And then, you know, I was very affected by this <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> problems, too, with this Kosovo deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1710">Because it was so similar to what we have gone through. </span><span class="sentence" id="1711">And there were... there again, and I don’t know how you feel about it, some people who hate our president and hate the Democrats, would be very much against that he started this bombing and he started invading and going in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1712">I had very mixed feelings toward the end, when the bombs kept on falling and maybe innocent people were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1713">That bothered me, but at the same time, I thought to myself, if anybody would have tried to do and stopped at least part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1714">They would have bombed, let’s see, the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> , when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1715">Not necessarily mine, but hundreds and hundreds of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1716">It could have maybe stopped something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">And nobody did anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1718">And therefore, because I feel that way so strongly, I was saying that they did the right thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1719">Although it’s a very complicated situation and it’s never going to be peace in that part of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">And even my friend, Ilus, we talked on the phone once and she was upset—now that surprised me—over the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1721">And she was not, she didn’t feel like I do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1722">QUESTION:  The bombing of <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1723">ANSWER: <span class="COUNTRY"> Kosovo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">And she said, because she was from that part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and she said something that, those problems go back to eighteen whatever and there will be never peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">And Albanians and so on and so forth... that this is not going to help and the bombing just causes more, you know, destruction and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">And I was surprised by her saying that, because maybe there will be never peace, but at least it showed something to the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">That’s the way I feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">That something like that has to be stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">Whether they completely can stop it, you know, one doesn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">But I... it bothered me, the bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">It bothered me, but then every time I watched the news where people were happy that they were being helped, it made me feel good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">Because just some food given to them or the shelter or the whatever, what would we have given if somebody would have rescued us during the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">And what would those other people have done, who were there for three years, if that could have been stopped? </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">That’s the way I feel, whether that satisfies you or not.</span></p>
