<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Okay, for the record give us your name and a little bit about your early background?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name is Herbert Friedman. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">And my early background is really very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> in 1918. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My father had migrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> , my mother from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> , good stock. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">The two of them, they met and married in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> I think it was, and that's where I grew up. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> there, I went to <span class="BUILDING">university</span> there, and graduated from <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> in 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Two brothers, both of whom are still living. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">A strong, tight, good Jewish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Conservative congregation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Quite modern in those days, from my parents, men and women sitting together, organ in the congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">The Rabbi, a wonderful person, himself Vilna-born, but took a Ph.D. at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , writing three volumes of the history of the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I mean that was a man, good brain, good human being, and working in this small middle class ordinary congregation, nothing famous about him, but very impressive to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  What was your awareness of the rise of Hitler as you were growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Well, that's the whole story. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">The whole story of my life revolves around that. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">In <span class="BUILDING">college</span> between the years of 1934 to '38, formative years, fully cognizant of what was happening, as fully as anybody could be who watched carefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The argument that people didn't know what was going on in those days has never never seemed valid to me because you could read it in the New York Times. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">If I did, others did. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">But at any rate, it bothered me when I looked around '34, '35, '36, in '36 the Nuremberg laws were passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">It was quite clear what the intent was. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Hitler's book was out. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">He had been in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> , he wrote it there back in 1925. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">The book was available to be read. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I read parts of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">It's turgid writing, it's not easy, Mein Kampf, but never mind you've got the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">So that I could not understand the silence of the whole American Jewish Community around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I did understand some of the politics. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">There was a difference quite clear in those days between the "Ost-Juden," the Russian-Polish Jews and the German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">The American Jewish Committee was in correspondence with people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> who were advising them quiet, don't raise a fuss, you'll make it worse, don't organize protests, no, don't listen to Stephen Wise, don't have a parade down <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span> , and they were attracted by that kind of advice, they were even enchanted by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">It gave them a perfect rationalization. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Now, there not the only villain in the piece, everybody latched on to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So I don't want to be misunderstood about the American Jewish Committee only or specifically. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">The mood was (a) we're not sure of what's happening, (b) it can't be as bad as some people are saying it is, (c) what can we do about it anyhow, and (d) the American Government isn't disturbed, and Franklin Roosevelt is a great friend of the Jews and he isn't upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Nobody is upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">All of these factors seemed to me to be leading to a dreadful conclusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">So on the specific point of how I was reacting in terms of what I saw around me, I was getting more and more furious, that's a worthwhile word, and frustrated and that was the condition that I felt I was in when I was 19 years old and had graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  You graduated as a young manâ€™?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Young, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  And then what did you decide to do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Well, don't forget we were at the tail end of the Depression, and a man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> by the name of Samuel Leidesdorf, a big accounting firm, and a major factor in the New York, UJA -- well, it wasn't yet the UJA, it was the Palestine Appeal, said to me I'll give you a job as an accountant for $25.00 a week if you'll go to <span class="BUILDING">Columbia Business School</span> and learn accounting. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So, okay, $25.00 a week, and so I went to Columbia Graduate School of Business, stayed one year, couldn't stand it for another day, couldn't dream of myself as being an accountant, so I quit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  $25.00 --
ANSWER:  A week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  -- was the equivalent today of what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Oh, gosh, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">30 times that amount, $700.00, $800.00 a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">A very good job.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  So it was a nice starting salary?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, a nice starting salary, perfectly acceptable. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Tuition was $450.00 at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Today it's $23,500.00. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So that there I was, I was at the end, I owed money to <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , I owed money to <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> and it's now 1939, the war has not yet broken out in Europe but it's imminent, and <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> is 1n a totally isolationist mood, no thought of participating in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Roosevelt was jockeying like mad to give the British some support and so he was making these funny deals called lend/lease, we will lend you some of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">destroyers</span> on lease, you will pay us rent for our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">destroyers</span> , but we're not going to get into your war. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So it was really so ambivalent and so confused and so costly in the long run. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">At any rate my personal requirements were that I had better go and get a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> and got a job in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> working at a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> making blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I worked two shifts, 16 hours a day, and I earned enough money to pay back all the debts. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And I also did the most important thing at that stage in my life, I decided what I really wanted to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  Which was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  I tried to figure out during all those mindless hours at the machine where all you're trying to do is keep your hand away from the needle which you're just feeding cloth through and it's robot work, and I said why should I continue being so frustrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">If the American Jewish Community isn't awake why don't I try to awaken them, but how do you do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">That's when I decided that I would become a rabbi, not because of any theological sudden insights, I had no epiphanies, I had no -- I conceived of myself really as a civil servant. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And if I had a <span class="DLF">platform</span> from which to speak I would use that platform to try to wake people up. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">It was sort of simplistic, very idealistic, but satisfying to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">On the other hand, again I felt I'm stopping myself for at least three years from getting into any action mode and yet I'd better do that or else I'll be frustrated the rest of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So I finished with the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , backed off, went to <span class="BUILDING">rabbinical seminary</span> with Stephen Wise in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and we did four year's worth of work in three, no summer vacations, no nothing, 11-1/2 months you worked, two weeks off, and kept going that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  What was the mood in <span class="BUILDING">rabbinical school</span> , were students preparing for a career, was there a sense of --
ANSWER:  Well, Wise being the person he was and focused the way he was, every one of the students in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> became acutely sensitized to the current events around us. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So, sure, everybody was preparing for a career, you needed to get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pulpit</span> or a job somewhere to earn your living, but the ideology was developing among this group before the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> merged with the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew Union College</span> out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">It graduated about 220 reform rabbis, but reform rabbis of a totally different kind than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> was producing. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I sat for all those years next to a fellow by the name of Osher Krishblu- (e or m?) </span><span class="sentence" id="71">who later became the Chairman of the Misrachi, and he sat with his kippa and I sat without a kippa and the whole faculty liked it that way and Wise liked it that way, and the dean, Henry Slominski liked it that way, it was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in which "Klal Israel" or pluralism or whatever word you want to use, which is so fashionable today, was really being practiced in the '30s and '40s, the only <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in which it was being carried out as a definite ideological objective, and every student picked it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  Tell us a little bit about Stephen Wise, his <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , what was his role in this, what was his role in the American Jewish Community at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Well, his role in the American Jewish Community was superb. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">He was the leader of the protest, the ceaseless effort to try to persuade Roosevelt, to whom he had automatic access, Rabbi Stephen Wise was acceptable to Roosevelt at request, and saw him frequently. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">He failed to convince him of anything, but Wise was the pusher, Wise was the ageressor seeking to have a large protest meeting in <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span> , and we'll get 25,000 people there or 20,000 whatever the <span class="BUILDING">Garden</span> holds. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And he filled it every time, talking about the fact we must do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">He sounded -- he was the only one who sounded the tocsin, the call, he was the bugle. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Almost no response except in those of us who were listening to him very very carefully and very closely. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I adored him, I admired him, I respected him. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">The personal impact used to come on Thursday mornings. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Thursday morning he had a class called problems of the ministry. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">A big round <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seminar table</span> , 18, 12 students around the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And problems of the ministry or how do you conduct a wedding how do you conduct a funeral? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Nothing of the sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">He would go into his pocket, he would take out the latest telegram that he got from the World Jewish Congress, Riegner in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> , and because he was a key player in the World Jewish Congress he started the American Jewish Congress, he believed in Democracy and he had hoped that those organizations would really be democratic in the sense every member would vote for its officiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">It never happened that way in practice, but in theory it was at that time the most democratic, and still to this day the most liberal organization I think in existence in the panoply of our alphabet soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So he would take the telegram out and tell us what was the latest stuff going on in Europe in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> or this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or another.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  So you were with him in the period of '39 through --
ANSWER:  '39 to '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I left in '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I graduated, I went out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> to take a --
QUESTION:  Did you know of the existence of Riegner telegram?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">We students knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He read it to us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  And what was the its impact?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  On us?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Devastating and confirming. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">It confirmed us in our desire, because I wasn't the only one who felt this frustrated and who wanted to get out there and try to wake up -- so we were getting confirmation to our own personal feelings from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And I think that if he felt that he was failing to arouse the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He was succeeding in arousing us. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">That was, I think, the greater of two contributions which he made. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And we were champing at the bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And so many of us in those classes spent the one year which the Army required for you to go and be an intern, that is by medical metaphor. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">You graduated <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , now be an intern in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for a year, and then we will take you into the Army and we'll commission you as a medical officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">The same with clergymen., </span><span class="sentence" id="106">go out, get your congregational experience, what good that was going to do you in the Army I have no idea, but that was their bureaucracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And so each of us was impatient to get out, get the congregational job, spend the year and then get into the chaplaincy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  Let me focus for a moment on the Riegner telegram. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Do you remember when you heard the Riegner telegram --
ANSWER:  Well, it was in '42.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  -- August of '42?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Aug. '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I didn't remember which month exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Well, so then it would have been a week or two weeks thereafter. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Remember I said <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was continuous, there were no summer vacations. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So let's call it -- yes, it was before Rosh Hashanah. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Yes I remember it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So I can't tell you the exact date, but we all used it in sermons that we made. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I used it. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">remember I used it. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But who was listening to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I mean we didn't make any ripples. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Students make any ripples out in the big world. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And if you were a student-Raggi at -- where was I? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">It was a place in <span class="REGION">Virginia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So you're talking to one group of people and you're reading this telegram to them and you're saying wake up, wake up. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">The impact was quite limited, quite personal. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And, you know, the Riegner telegram of 1942 became such a big sensation later as proof that we had evidence and everybody chose to bury it. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Wyman in his book talks about the fact that the State Department didn't want it transmitted to anybody, they wanted it just kept secret. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">They were afraid of what impact it would make and so indeed it didn't make any for a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">But Wise had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We his students had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We tried to get it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I don't know when it hit the press.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  How did Wise see his own role?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  I don't think he stood still long enough to see his own role. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">He was in constant motion. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">He was in furious motion. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And the fact that he would meet us every Thursday morning at 11:00 o'clock week after week after week, year after year meant that that was a holy moment for him, a crucial moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">If you can transmit something to your students then at least your mortality becomes less important. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">If you can't transmit anything to anybody and it's all bottled up in you, then it's dreadful that you are going to die with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But he never had a sense of dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">He was vigorous and always moving, speaking out ....Listen, he was the prime spokesman to the non Jewish world not just to the Jewish world. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">In the first half of the 20th century every clergyman in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> knew the name of Stephen Wise. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And so his satisfactions came from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Toward the end he developed cancer in the throat and died in '49 never having set foot on the sovereign soil of the State of Israel. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">At the very end I remember seeing him once and he said that was the greatest tragedy of his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">He spent his whole life working for the cause of Zionism and when it reached its fruition he never had the joy and the glory of setting foot on that soil.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  Let's go back to '42.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  You then finished -- this was the Jewish Institute of Religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  Jewish Institute of Religion in New York. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Later after he died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> , I think it was still Nelson Glick who was the president out there, came and pushed for the merger. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Some of us fought against the merger. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We had a different conception of what the reform movement was then they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Rabbi Morton Berman of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , I remember, and Rabbi Philip Bernstein of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochester</span> , those were two of my very close friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">They were a few years ahead of me, a few years older than I was, but still we became very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">We fought the merger unsuccessfully, because Wise dead and no fund-raising -- he was the prime fund-raiser, he kept it going. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So the merger took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We scattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I was graduated and went out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> in '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Wise said to me, you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Wise used to think that if he could place a man in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pulpit</span> somewhere that he would then have a right to go to that man and to do some fund-raising in that congregation in support of the alma mater, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> you went to. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So he was always desperately seeking good congregational placements. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Well, this was a congregation out there that had a thousand family memberships in 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">The congregation was older than the State of Colorado. </span><span class="sentence" id="167"><span class="REGION">Colorado</span> came into the Union in 1876. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Centennial State, that's the name of the book Centennial that what's his name wrote, Michener. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">The congregation was 1874. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">It was started by Simon Guggenheim, later Senator Guggenheim, American Mining and Smelting Company, a powerful, big German classical reform (<span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So Wise pushed me as, I guess one of his favorite sons, into that congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Stay there and we'll always then have a foot in the <span class="DLF">door</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  You went out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> , what happened then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  Well, I had a lovely year there, fighting hard with the congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">Their previous rabbi, also named Friedman, had been there for 50 years and taught then anti-Zionism, anti- Hebrew, anti-Bar Mitzvah, anti-Oriental ceremonials like putting on a hat, etcetera, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">50 years, two generations, I couldn't dream of upsetting that in one year, but I got close to it, split the congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I said why don't you guys go off and be homogeneous in your anti-Zionism, I'm going to take this congregation and turn it around. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So you're going to be listening to stuff that's going to irritate you, and your presence out there in front 1s going to irritate me, so take a Safer Torah and goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Today <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> has two big, big strong <span class="BUILDING">reform temples</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">The anti group has long since come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So I think I did a good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">That was the year. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And then I went to the Army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="184">QUESTION:  Let's talk for a little bit about the American Jewish Community at that point from the vantage point of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">You've already mentioned one division between Zionism and non Zionism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  And you've mentioned a second division between an activism that Wise was pushing for in a much more conservative posture of don't rock the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">How did you experience the division of the Denver Jewish Community during the year 1943 which after all was the height of the holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  I'm not sure what you mean by how did I experience the division. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I exacerbated the division inside the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> by splitting it. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And on the basis of this ideological definition of Zionism as being compatible with reformed Judaism, '43 was the crucial year in which the Central Conference of American Rabbis passed a vote on the resolution "Is reform Judaism compatible with Zionism." </span><span class="sentence" id="192">That's the way the resolution was framed and the votes were taken, role call vote name by name by name by name. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">You had to stand up, it was not a secret ballot. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">The vote was three to one in favor of that resolution. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Yes, these two ideologies are perfectly compatible, three to one, 300 to 100. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And the 100 guys went off and formed the American Council for Judaism, the anti-Zionist organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">The 300 guys controlled the future growth of the reform movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">But it wasn't only on the Zionist issue, it was on the issue of ritual. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">What is a Bar Mitzvah? </span><span class="sentence" id="200">What a silly, stupid thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">That boy isn't a man at the age of 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We do not have Bar Mitzvahs. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Well, and that was the practice out in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cincinnati</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">That's the way those graduates were being taught. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Our graduates were pushing greater ritual observance, so we were accused of being Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Well, on order to validate that accusation which I thought was the ironic way to handle the whole thing, my best friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was a Rabbi Manuel Lederman who was the Orthodox rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">It used to delight my supporters when they would see the two of us walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">It used to infuriate my enemies and gave them visible proof that I was a traitor to the reform movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">We were friends all our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And his son, Paul, who lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> now, I still see once in a while.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> was there a move for political activism at that point on behalf of the European Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">ANSWER:  No, there was a move on behalf of Zionism. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">You know the accusation which is made against Ben Gurion himself and all the Palestinian-centered Zionist officials, that they didn't pay much attention to the holocaust, they didn't express their outrage at it, they didn't do very much except the Haganah, the military arm of the Jewish agency which tried to do something about it because, and these are the theories, because the Zionist leaders felt that the battle over saving Jewish life in Europe was lost, but that the battle for creating a state which would harbor whoever would be left alive had yet to be won. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So of the two battles, why fight the one which is already hopeless, you must fight the one which contains the hope for the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Now that was pretty much Ben Gurion's philosophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">We talked about it many times and he wasn't cold, he wasn't calloused, his heart was as wounded as everybody's was, but he was a terribly practical and pragmatic person. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And so he said I've got to concentrate on Zionism and building the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I want a Jewish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">He was fighting for that as part of the Allied armies in order to stake a claim afterwards to be able to sit at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">peace table</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  Which period of time did you first meet Ben Gurion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">ANSWER:  Well, I first met him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">So in '43 I didn't yet know him, but I knew the Zionist concept that concentrated instead on trying to persuade the as yet unconvinced American Jewish public that that's where the future lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">1943 was only a year after the Biltmore Resolution was passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">The Zionists themselves never dared use the word "state" until 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">They were also groping their way toward the definition of their own movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Courage finally prevailed. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Again, Ben Gurion at the <span class="BUILDING">Biltmore Hotel</span> , that's the name from which the resolution was drawn, had a big conference there. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Ben Gurion stood up and said we must pass a resolution that we are trying to create a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , a state. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">This was quite revolutionary in '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">In '43 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> we're all arguing about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And I was preaching sermon after sermon about state and army, army and state, independence and sovereignty, these are the only answers to powerlessness. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">We're powerless without them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  And why did you decide to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> and join the Army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  Well because the fight was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I mean the point is that I could continue trying to argue with these Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> , and I made tremendous strides with them and I knew I would win the fight or history would win the fight, not I, but I wanted to be where the history was. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">So 365 days to the day, like the prisoner scratches the nail on the <span class="DLF">cement wall</span> of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> when the calendar -- and my old friend Rabbi Bernstein, Phil Bernstein, was the Executive Secretary of the Chaplaincy Commission of the Jewish Welfare Board, which certified to the Army that this rabbi yes indeed is sane and etcetera and we recommend that you take him and commission him First Lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I think it was $1,000.00 a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">That was better than the $25.00, which was the last offer I had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">QUESTION:  That was $1,000.00 a month?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  $12,000.00 a year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  In '45?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">What do you think I was being paid in the congregation? </span><span class="sentence" id="246">$75.00 a week, $75.00 a week, $3,600.00 a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So Army pay was fabulous, it was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">$3,600.00 a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">The Army was the Mecca. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And then you go through the process. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">You go to a <span class="BUILDING">chaplaincy school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Devens</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="252">in <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">You go to an infantry training regiment in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Blanding</span> in Florida. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And then you are assigned -- I was assigned as an infantry chaplain and you get -- we sailed from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> and were put into a <span class="BUILDING">replacement depot</span> up in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Namur</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And then you get assigned to a regiment. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I was assigned to the 9th Infantry Division which was part of the Third Army which was General Patton. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">They were fighting over in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">We were in this <span class="BUILDING">depot</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So then I was in already and feeling less strange about a uniform and saluting and shooting and all that stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">QUESTION:  This was when?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">ANSWER:  '45, spring of '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I mentioned Namur. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I have to tell you a story. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">This was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and we are in a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and thousands of officers being shuffled around and it's paperwork and that takes (x) number of weeks before everybody gets sorted out. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So one day I was walking through this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , hardly more than a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and I see a store front with a Magen David on the <span class="DLF">window</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  Jewish star?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">A Star of David, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Well, okay, wow, what's this! </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I went past it a number of times until one day I saw that it was open and there were people <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I walked in and in the second <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , in the back and not visible to the <span class="DLF">street</span> , I realized that this was a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">There was a little Ark and over the Ark there was a picture of a catholic priest with a collar and no name, no designation. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So I found one old man there who was sort of the caretaker and he told me the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">What are you doing over the Holy Ark, this catholic priest? </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Well, his name is Father Andre and we respect him because he saved so many Jewish lives, and the story pours out. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">The <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Namur</span> was in a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that was right next to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and in the back of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was where the priest was living and he had his <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and he had a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and the Gestapo officers, many of whom are catholic, half the population of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , many of whom used to come to sit and drink wine with the priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">And the priest figured that his <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> next door to this <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> was the safest place to hide Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And he was one on the network of an underground railroad that was passing Jews through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> trying to get them -- the ultimate safest destination was <span class="COUNTRY">Portugal</span> , neutral country, so it was always moving south. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Two Jews, four Jews in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , under his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , in the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wardrobe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Four Gestapo officers, five meters, ten feet away. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Risky! </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I mean the material that movie pictures are made out of. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Not a single Jew was caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Crazy things would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Four kids would show up at the <span class="DLF">back door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">He had to excuse himself, run, take them, push them under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , go back to the Gestapo guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Never a problem, never a failure, never a death. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Hundreds of Jews were saved going through his <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">When it was all over they decided they wanted -- the few remaining Jews wanted to give him a present so they bought him a new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> to replace his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> which had gotten so badly smashed in, which he had never slept for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And put his picture up over the Ark. And that was the first time I ever learned about "Haside1 Umoth Ha'olam," the righteous Gentiles of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And more and more today we're beginning to hear about them, and he was one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  What did you know of the Holocaust in '43, '44, '45?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was at its height in '44 and '45. </span><span class="sentence" id="294"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , '43 after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , that was the end of it, so <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> was at its height '42, '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="295"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> , Etc., </span><span class="sentence" id="296">all of them. '</span><span class="sentence" id="297">43, '44, '45, they were at the height of production. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So when you say what did I know about it, I knew those facts. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I knew the facts that the Americans had refused and the British had refused bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> even though both Air Forces were over-flying the <span class="DLF">Ploesti oil fields</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rumania</span> which were about ten minutes of flying time away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And they were using the excuse that they did not want to jeopardize Allied equipment and manpower. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">But it was an excuse, they were already flying past <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ploesti</span> , they could have. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">This just increased the sense of powerlessness. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We can't convince anybody so we're going to have to do this ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And the "this" has to be a firm determination to get the state and get back into a situation of power over our own destiny. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">But there was nothing that could be done about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">QUESTION:  You were a chaplain, when did you first encounter the survivors of the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I say <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> because the division that I was with was down in <span class="REGION">southern Germany</span> and we were at that time posted over in a little down called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wasserburg am Inn</span> which was between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saltzburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was right outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was liberated by the 42nd Division, I would say about May of '45, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">QUESTION:  April 29th.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  April 29th, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">It's good to have a real expert here. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Now, the first encounter I had with refugees was shortly thereafter, some matter of days or weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> south, all through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> were a whole network of underground German factories that were producing goods for the Army, everything from simple bullets to very complicated Howitzers. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">It was all done with slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">These people emerged. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">They were wondering around the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lakes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">It's heavily wooded area, and heavily infiltrated with lots of small <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lakes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I used to take <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> out of the <span class="DLF">motor pool</span> , 9th Division motor pool and start driving on these small <span class="DLF">country roads</span> looking for people and determining that they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">The process is very simple, you just drop their trousers and that's that. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And putting them into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and trying to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I could gather them and (a) let them be safe, and (b) get some food in and get some DDT powder and get some simple medicines. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Penicillin had just been invented but it was ferociously expensive and available only for syphilis. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">That's when I first encountered them. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And I remember an episode where we were driving down and we had about a half a load of people and we saw two children on the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> , this just remains locked in my head, and I jumped out and I wanted to talk to the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">You talk to them in a combination of German or Yiddish or Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">You find one of those three languages would work. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But the kids were frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">They saw a soldier in a uniform and they started to run across the <span class="DLF">field</span> and it's a little boy and a little girl, and they're holding hands and they're running and they're stumbling. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And I didn't want to threaten them by running faster than they were, so I kind of followed them and they were gasping and they were crying, and finally they ran out of steam and they stopped, and so I stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">After I got my arms around them and I tried to explain to them and I pointed to the chaplain's insignia on the uniform which was a little Ten Commandments thing and they quieted down. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I scooped up the two kids, they were about 10 or 11 years old, and I scooped up the kids and put them in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But the fear was so palpable. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And whatever experience they had been through was so utterly real that they were shocked out of any knowledge of their own names, where they came from, what they were doing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I mean it was like total amnesia. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And there was obviously already a medical condition; they could not remember their own names. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">It was the anonymity of those two survivors, they didn't know who they were, what happened to them, where they came from that really impacted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Because I don't understand the six million and I don't understand the one and a half million children or whatever the number is, but two children that's real, that's real. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And I said to myself, every single one such we have to try to save and rescue. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">What's dead 1s dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">It's all gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">It's ashes, and it's blown off in the wind. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">But what's living we can't leave them wondering around Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">And that's what I did for the next two and a half years. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">So I still remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">So that was the first encounter. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And when you would get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> full of 50 people, then the trick is to find some structure with four <span class="DLF">walls</span> and a <span class="DLF">roof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">So I remember once we would find a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> that had three <span class="DLF">walls</span> , and you would find an abandoned <span class="DLF">airfield</span> with a <span class="BUILDING">hangar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">You would find something. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">I remember once I found a <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">It was a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in perfect shape, fully occupied by German clerks, all busy working at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriters</span> , and I said hey this is a great <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Well, a Colt .45 is a heavy piece of equipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">You turn it around and hit the butt on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and you can break the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So a few knocks like that got the attention of the Burgermeister. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">It was a <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> so he's there, upstairs, <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And in nice German I told him this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was now beschlagnamt, this was requisitioned in the name of the United States Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I had no more authority to do that than you do, than you would have, but the uniform was its own authority and the .45 was it's own authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So that, okay, I want this <span class="NPIP">place</span> empty and I want it "sauber" and clean and I want it ready tomorrow morning and everybody out I am bringing in some "Fluechtlinge," refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">He doesn't have to know who they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">And, you know, sure enough tomorrow morning it was clean, it was empty, it was available, it was warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">He had some wood in the back for a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wood stove</span> , and 50 Jews had -- now, this is called a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I mean you've got to designate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">You've got a location for it, you give it a name, it's got a population. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And to cut a long story short by the time we got all through there were 64 locations in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , another six or eight in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and even two in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , all where the American Army was housing quarter of a million people. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">The starting number that I was aware of when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> was liberated, that were a few months earlier, was 35,000 Jews alive on <span class="REGION">German soil</span> either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , liberated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or from slave labor in <span class="BUILDING">German factories</span> , 35,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">That number was determined by a fellow named Abraham Klausner, a chaplain who was with the forces that got into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> right after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="367">QUESTION:  You used the word "we," who 1s we? </span><span class="sentence" id="368">So far you've only described operating really on your own intuition.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="370">QUESTION:  When did it get organized?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="371">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">It got organized somewhere in a higher echelon unbeknownst to me, probably three or four years earlier because the Haganah organized it and it was called Aliyah Bet. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Aliyah Bet meant --
QUESTION:  Haganah was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="374">ANSWER:  Haganah was the military arm of the Jewish Agency, underground Jewish self- government while the British are in mandatory control of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">So you have an underground government administering the affairs of the population, 600,000 Jews in the Yishuv, and that underground government had an underground army. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And at its height the Haganah had about 25,000 men and women. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Just so you should compare it to the other two underground organizations, the Irgun which was Begin's organization had about 3,000 people, and the Stern Gang, which was Shamir's organization had about 300 people, so that gives you a scale. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Now, the Haganah organized two departments to work outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">One was called Aliyah Bet, which obviously is different what what, from Aliyah Aleph. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Aliyah means migration to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Aleph is number 1, Bet is number 2. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Number | is legitimate, legal. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">It's what the British permitted. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">The British permitted 1,500 Jews per month to receive certificates to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Well, at 1,500 a month we were going to be many, many, many decades cleaning up what the remnant was in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Therefore Aliyah Bet, method number 2, illegal, was somebody going into Europe, organizing groups of people, sending <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> 1n to try to take these people to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> against the wishes of the British or anybody else who might try to stop them, including the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">They started earlier in the game. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">They were taking <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> out of <span class="DLF">Rumanian port</span> , for instance <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Constanza</span> on the Black Sea, in '41, in '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">These were efforts that were so desperate and so futile, a few hundred here, a few hundred there, and so sad in the ending, many of those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> sunk, many of the people drowned. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">So that was the start of the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">But when the war ended in '45 the Haganah guys came in to Europe in what was for them force, maybe as many as 100, and it might have been 150, I'm never sure of the whole number, and they recruited me. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">That's the "we."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">QUESTION:  Well, how did they recruit you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  Oh, it's a crazy story. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I was in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Tolz</span> and the telephone rings and there is a lady on the phone, and I was 27 years old, unmarried, and this lady invites me to come to see her in her <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Royal Monceau Hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So wouldn't you go, I mean under those conditions? </span><span class="sentence" id="397">When we finally met face to face I was quickly disabused of all such ulterior motives on my part and we got back to good old idealism. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">She said that she had heard what I was doing and she wanted me to come to meet her and she wanted me to -- she wanted to talk to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">That was the phone conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I got orders and went a few days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">The British flag was hanging from the front of that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">It was right near the Etoile, <span class="DLF">Avenue Foch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">What's the British flag doing on this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="405">She answers the <span class="DLF">door</span> , she keeps me waiting out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">She says will you work for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So your question "we." </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Will you work for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Who is us? </span><span class="sentence" id="410">She says the Haganah. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Now, sometimes in life you make decisions on the basis of careful evaluation of all the fact involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">There were no facts here and you operated by intuition. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">And something told me to say yes and I said yes and it changed my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">She kind of went across the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , I'm still out in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> , but I can see she goes to the <span class="DLF">door</span> at the far end of the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">A short white-haired man comes out, walks across. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">She says to him, Friedman will work for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">He comes over, shakes hands with me, says thank you, turns around and walked out, and I didn't see him for a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Aside from the fact that I didn't know who he was at the moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So then she said that's Mr. David Ben Gurion, and I said who's he. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">I didn't connect in my mind that this was the Ben Gurion who is the head of the Jewish Agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">He's supposed to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> or in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rhodesia</span> somewhere where they scooped up everybody when the British did that Black Shabbat. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">No, no she says, that's Mr. Ben Gurion. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">I said what's he doing here in the <span class="BUILDING">British hotel</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So she said you never read Poe. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">The purloined letter is right under your nose, and that's the safest <span class="NPIP">place</span> to put it. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">So then I sat down and I said okay, and she gave me a cup of coffee and I took off my coat, and what have I committed myself to? </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Okay, well what you were doing down in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> in <span class="REGION">southern Bavaria</span> is fine, that's one thing, but we heed you, you've got to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , you've got to get yourself settled there. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">You get a big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you get six <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">backyard</span> , you get enough gas tickets for a year, you're going to run the route from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> up on the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> , north almost up to the Baltic, way northeast of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I said that's all <span class="REGION">Russian territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> is an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> in the middle of the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">She said that's right. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I said we're going to run <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> for 150 miles through the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> , across the <span class="DLF">Polish- Russian border</span> , come down through the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="434">She said that's it, that's what you're going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I said that's what I'm going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">She said well, we'll send over some Chayalim, some soldiers from the Palestine Brigade who are on bivouac over in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="437">The British didn't want them to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="438">These were 30,000 guys, well armed and well experienced in infantry warfare, which by no means did the British want to have in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So they were keeping them there in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> doing nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">So we'll send you 12 fellows and they'll ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> with you back and forth.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="444">QUESTION:  So how do you move to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and what do you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  Well, I said to her -- she said I don't care how you do it, it's not my business, you get yourself transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">If you don't know any of the ropes of your own Army by now then what good are you going to be to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I mean she was sort of mocking even. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">She said don't bother me with these details. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I had to get myself transferred to <span class="BUILDING">Berlin Headquarters Command</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">There was one stroke of luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">There was a guy occupying that post who was ready to be de-mobilized and go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="452">His name was Joseph Shubo, an Orthodox Rabbi from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And Joe Shubo was just leaving, so I put in an application to take his <span class="NPIP">place</span> because we didn't need a chaplain in the 9th Infantry Division anymore, we needed somebody up in <span class="BUILDING">Berlin Headquarters Command</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">The personnel department bought it, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So I was officially transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Now, as far as a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> is concerned, we found in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dahlem</span> in a very lovely residential section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> a nice big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> relatively undestroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">The big <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , we got them repaired. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">One whole <span class="DLF">back wall</span> knocked out, we fixed it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">This is easy, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">You pick up craftsmen and bricks and cement all inside your own <span class="BUILDING">Army headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And I stole the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> from the <span class="DLF">motor pool</span> , that's relatively easy if you want to take the risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And I stole the gas tickets, that's easy if you want to take the risk. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And I called her in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and I said okay send -- so the Chevrah came over and they lived in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">It was called the Jewish Chaplain's Center. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">On the <span class="REGION">military side</span> there were 2,000 Jewish troops in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> in four armies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  The American, the British, the French?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  American, British, French, Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Did you ever see that old movie "Four Men in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Jeep</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="469">The patrolling of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was done with the four soldiers of the four Allied Armies. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">It was called the Allierte Kommandatur, the Allied Command. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Okay, and the reason we knew what there was because when the Sader came now, the first Sader after freedom was in 1946, Passover, so we started to prepare for it, we wound up having 2,000 guys in the <span class="BUILDING">Schoeneberg Rathaus</span> for Seder, the first Seder in freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">The same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> from which Kennedy once came and spoke from the <span class="INT_SPACE">balcony</span> , "Ich Bin ein Berliner," "I'm a Berliner," he was sympathizing with the German population. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">That was the same <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> in which we had the Seder. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">And so there was a big group of troops from whom to draw what I needed which was cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">That's why we called it the Jewish Chaplain's Center for the Allied Command of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">It wasn't just the Americans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">QUESTION:  These soldiers, your groups that you were able to draw from clearly cooperated. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">How did Jewish soldiers feel being in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , what was going through the minds of some of the people you were dealing with on a professional basis in the military life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">ANSWER:  Well, you know, how do they feel about being in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="480">Those who were consciously Jewish, and that was not all of them by any means, you'd be surprised. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Even, you know, we talk about assimilation today, 1992, let me tell you something, assimilation was already beginning to take its toll in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">People who were not denying that they were Jews, but not consciously caring Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">They didn't have any feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">See, Germans to them were the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Nazis were the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Germans were exploitable. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">A carton of cigarettes would buy you a Leica camera. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">A carton of cigarettes cost 70 cents in the PX, no tax.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">QUESTION:  What about the Jews who were consciously Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  Oh, so they were distraught and they were upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">They knew because the Army newspaper Stars and Stripes was printing the whole story of all the revelations. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Eisenhower visited the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with his chief of staff, Walter Biddle Smith, that's on the front page of Stars and Stripes. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">And Eisenhower says this is shocking and this 1s awful, and there is a long story on the front page, and a long story inside. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">And the guys who cared read those stories and they were constantly in the Army indoctrination lectures that they listened to once every week. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">They heard everything, they knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And the ones who cared were distraught. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And I used to try to, again do what I did all the time, turn their thinking away from the negative and on to the positive because they didn't yet make the connection. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And I found that the way that you got them to understand was to demand something of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">If you don't demand anything of people they don't respond. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Nobody lines up in the <span class="DLF">window</span> , at the <span class="DLF">window</span> , to volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">When you do demand, when you ask people suddenly realize there's a sense of discipline somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Somewhere somebody is planning something and needs your help. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And that always evokes a response.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="531">QUESTION:  You sold this to soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">ANSWER:  Certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">To the ones who cared. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I got 300 people a night. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">I've got to pay 100, 300 cartons of cigarettes, $150.00 a carton, that should be that's $45,000.00 worth of cigarettes every single night, every single night. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">We used to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> at dusk. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">It took about until midnight to get up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> , that 150 miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">We loaded in about ten minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">The Haganah guys on the Polish side of the <span class="DLF">line</span> had their people all ready, 300 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">If we had 320 we took 320. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">If we had to throw away the baggage, the poor crumbling pieces, suitcase, a valise, that mostly had 1n it things like photographs, diaries, what did you carry? </span><span class="sentence" id="542">You didn't carry an extra pair of socks or underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">We used to throw the baggage overboard to get three more people on. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Kind of ruthless. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And then leaving there at about midnight, getting back into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> by dawn, so this was an operation that took place at night totally. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I said now this is what I need, and so you've got to give me a carton of cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I've got to get 300 cartons a night prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I need thousands of cartons of cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">So if the guy paid 70 cents for it, but he was giving me $150.00 because if he took and he sold that on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> even for currency, not for a Leica, a set of china, he sold it for currency, occupation Marks, go right over to the <span class="BUILDING">Army post office</span> , buy a money order in U.S. Dollars, send that money order <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to his wife or his mother or whatever to put it in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> for him, every single week if he didn't smoke he was saving $150.00. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">So for him to give that to me was an authentic large gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">My father used to send me thousands of cartons of cigarettes a week which he collected from his <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> , from <span class="BUILDING">B'nai Jacob</span> up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Haven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="552">And I had the postal inspectors on my <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Chaplain's Center</span> because this 1s cash and they want to know what are you doing with it, Chaplain. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And I'd say if you guys find me doing anything illegal with it then you arrest me. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Until that time do me a favor and don't worry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Well, you know there's a certain power of the cloth, you know, that works, and so I took advantage of it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="571">ANSWER:  Well, the conversation by the way was not only with him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I'll jump ahead and say later on down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> it was with General McNarney who succeeded Eisenhower, and it was with General Lucius Clay who succeeded McNarney. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">So all down the <span class="DLF">line</span> I always went to the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">How do you do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="574">General, you know about the problem of what Hitler did to the Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">You know about the fact that there is a remnant of refugees, wanderers, survivors here in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">QUESTION:  You were using the language roughly Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Were survivors introduced at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="579">ANSWER:  Sure, people who survived Hitler, people who survived Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Every camp that was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">There were a lot of dead corpses around, but there were people who walked out of there alive and they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">So we used the word then, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">As a matter of fact I used to teach them the Hebrew "She'erit Hapletah," the surviving remnant of the -- now, these people want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">The General says yes, well all these displaced persons they all got to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">There were 10 million of them and the Army is repatriating all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Right, General, the Army is repatriating all of them, but there is one group that the Army doesn't know what to do with and that's the Jews because they have no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">They're not going to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="588">If you talk citizenship, that you're going to repatriate people according to their citizenship, if it's a Belgium slave laborer or a French or a Norwegian or a Dane or anybody who has been conquered by the Nazis, held as a slave laborer you repatriate him back to his original <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Jews are not going back to their original <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , all of which are cemeteries. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">So the Army isn't going to repatriate Jews to remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , where do all these people want to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="591">So sometimes the Army guy knows enough to say well, I understand they all want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And if he doesn't know that he says, well where do they want to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">So you tell him, and then you go off on the Zionist story. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">The American Army didn't have any more sympathy for the British Army than Britains had for Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">So you painted the British as the bad guys who were trying to prevent these people from going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and you depict <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as something that every Bible-loving American, you're not talking to Jews, you are talking to Protestants largely and some Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Catholics are mostly urban and not as well acquainted with the Bible, Biblical impulse, as rural or small town Protestants. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And so you've got his sympathy. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I never once ran into an inimical officer of high rank, never once. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I've run into them on lower ranks where I'm not discussing anything with them, but I'm listening to kind of a, you know, sort of profane kind of vulgar anti-semitism, but I always discounted that, it didn't bother me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">QUESTION:  So you tell them about the Jews want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">ANSWER:  And therefore, and therefore we are collecting them. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Who is we? </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Well, there's an organization of Palestinians that's collecting, collecting the means. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">They're moving from east. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Don't forget that the Russians took hundreds of thousands of Jews eastward as the Nazi armies moved eastward, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">The Russians for their own reasons, not altruistic, they're not pro-semitic, Stalin didn't love Jews, but this was maybe a half a million or to a million people whom he used as labor out beyond the <span class="REGION">Urals</span> in <span class="REGION">Central Asia</span> cutting timber mostly, sending back railroad ties. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Well, okay, the war is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Three quarters of them are dead of starvation and hunger and over-work, but there is a good chunk of hundreds of thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">How can I have brought them from as far out as <span class="COUNTRY">Tajikistan</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Uzbekistan</span> and Turkestan, moving them westward, all the time westward toward where the American Army was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So I said there is an organization of Palestinians that is trying to round up these people and bring them together because if you get them all collected someplace you can handle them easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I mean that's a very clear approach to a mechanistically-minded Army General. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">That's how he thinks anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">So I said now there is a whole -- they've come as far west as the border of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and a bunch of them are up in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> , that's the collecting point, and at that point these Palestinian guys can't come into the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so there are some of us here who are helping them. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Now, if he wants to be really very very GI, well are you doing this at the expense of your Army duties? </span><span class="sentence" id="615">No, sir. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">No, sir. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I'm running my services, I've got 700, 800 guys coming every Friday night, every Saturday morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Why don't you come over, General, and you'll read the Torah portion of the week. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And okay, okay, you keep doing a good job. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So what are you telling me all this for? </span><span class="sentence" id="621">I said well, look I think you ought to know it because it's happening in your command, in your <span class="REGION">territory</span> for which you are responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">There might come an episode where the Russians will raise <span class="NPIP">hell</span> with a truckload of refugees, and you don't want to be caught short not knowing what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Right, good, thanks. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I love a guy who keeps me informed. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Again, straight Army mentality. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">So, yes, and that policy always paid off. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">It paid off in hundreds of ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">It paid off with 2,000 calories per day from the Army to every DP in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And the JDC Joint Distribution Committee brought in supplementary rations of 1,200 so the DP who had been starved for years, the displaced person, is eating now 3,200 calories a day, great. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Most of it Army food. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And so every night we'd run up there and take our load and --
QUESTION:  You would go with them every night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">ANSWER:  Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">I couldn't go every night, but once a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Because most of the time I was hustling for the cigarettes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">QUESTION:  Who would be your drivers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="636">ANSWER:  The Palestinian guys, the Chayalim, with one driver and one guy running shotgun, so it's two fellows on each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , so that's the 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">She said get six <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">So I have six <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and 12 guys and they were on every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Every once in a while I get some really gung ho American sergeant, Jewish guy, and he'd say hey I want to ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I'd say listen, you know, it's your tachat, and I'm not going to translate that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">QUESTION:  The <span class="NPIP">exterior</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">ANSWER:  Yes, your exterior, anything happens, buddy, I can't help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So he'd come on board, you know, with his carbine or his M-1 and he'd feel that he as doing -- and he was, he was guarding 50 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Our drivers, we had wonderful, wonderful cooperation from Jewish guys in the Quartermaster pool. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">They were all good drivers. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Enough good drivers so that it was a delight to have them. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Well, you know, you run 300 people a night, a night, a night, every night and well we ran almost 100,000 people through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">But when you bring them in you've got a problem what do you do with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And not only how do you handle them, but you've got to get them out because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> is an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> don't forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">So that was all part of the game. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">We opened two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">One was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlattensee</span> out near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wannsee</span> , southeastern part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and one was at <span class="BUILDING">Templehof Airdrome</span> , right on the <span class="DLF">airfield</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">We had 10,000 people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlattensee camp</span> and 5,000 people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Templehof camp</span> , so I had <span class="NPIP">places</span> for 15,000 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">QUESTION:  Where were you getting 300 cartons of cigarettes a night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="655">ANSWER:  I'm getting it from the Gls, I'm getting it from my father, but the bulk finally came in from the JDC. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">The first <span class="DLF">port</span> in Europe that opened up where you could get massive shipments in --
QUESTION:  The JDC is the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="657">ANSWER:  American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, that's a long name, but the short name is "the Joint," the Joint. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">A marvelous organization, 75 or 85 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I don't know how old it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">It goes back to World War I. Brilliant professionalism. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">If I were asked to describe it in two words "Brilliant professionalism." </span><span class="sentence" id="662">No ego gets in the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">No politics get in the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Just plain what is the task, how shall we do it most efficiently and most cheaply, and don't use the excuse that you haven't got the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Define the task, figure out the methodology, figure out the cost and the UJA supplies the JDC with the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And there never was an insufficiency, there never was an argument.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">QUESTION:  So the Joint shipped in the cigarettes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">ANSWER: <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ"> Car</span> loads, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> loads. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Then I was free. </span><span class="sentence" id="670"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> opened up. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">The first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">port ships</span> came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Trains</span> were already working through <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="673">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremerhaven</span> down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And I got all the cigarettes I needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">And that's what kept it going. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">My improvisation was at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">But when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> opened and I got in touch with the Joint and they immediately responded.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">QUESTION:  And they knew what you were doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  The director of the Joint was a fellow by the name of Schwartz, Doctor Joseph Schwartz, and he was working hand in glove with the Haganah who was paying for the whole operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">It wasn't just this one little bit of the cigarettes. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">If you had a hundred Palestinian guys, the Haganah back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> didn't have any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">The Joint was financing that whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Throwing 1,200 calories per person per day into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> was -- in the campaign the UJA campaign in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , of 1946, in 1947, more UJA money was being given to the Joint for use in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> among this population than was being given to the Jewish Agency for work in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because the greater need was there in Europe in those two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">By 1948 it shifted and the greater share of the money was going to the Palestine operation, then <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So that was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and that was the camp at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schlattensee</span> and that was the camp at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Templehof</span> , and then the trick always was to organize trainloads to go out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> southward through the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> and come down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> which was in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> , and go into one of the 64 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">permanent camps</span> that were in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> and there catch your breath and sort out whom you wanted to send further south to the <span class="REGION">Mediterranean</span> to the French and <span class="REGION">Italian Riviera</span> , both of them, where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Haganah ships</span> came in to take the people who were willing to run the risk of the British gauntlet and most of whom were caught out on the high seas in contravention of international law, it didn't make any difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And the people were put by the British on the island of <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> which became an end goal in itself because it's only eight hours to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="687">So the people are on <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> is being collected and lined up in the port of Haifa. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">Now, I never saw it with my own eyes, but I saw a photograph, 57 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessels</span> caught by the British lined up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">They were old tramp steamers, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Greek ships</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Turkish ships</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="690">QUESTION:  How many of your colleagues, did you speak to other chaplains, were some of your colleagues involved, did you do any recruiting for the Haganah yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">ANSWER:  No, I didn't do any recruiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And the answer is yes I did speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">There were only a few. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">There was a fellow who was for a long time a rabbi in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , Eugene Lippman, a good guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">He was in on it with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">He worked over on the <span class="DLF">Czechoslovak border</span> , on what we call the <span class="DLF">southern route</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="697"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stettin</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , was the <span class="DLF">northern route</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="698">The <span class="DLF">southern route</span> was from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="REGION">lower Silesia</span> , part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nochood</span> , across to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Klaus</span> ?? </span><span class="sentence" id="699">in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , all the way eastward over to about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , westward back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">That was the <span class="DLF">southern route</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Lippman worked the <span class="DLF">southern route</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">He was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Who else was? </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I've got a fellow by the name of Meyer Abramowitz, a conservative rabbi, now retired in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">He followed me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="706">We had closed the <span class="DLF">route</span> down by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">He didn't have that much to do, but he maintained a large camp population, and later on he moved down to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> for the JDC. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Married his wife, a DP lady from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So Mike was in, Mike Abramowitz was in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Eugene Lippman was in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Klausner was in it at the beginning, not for long, but for a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">There were another dozen men whose names I don't remember who were demobilized, whom we re-recruited to come back because on that <span class="REGION">southern route</span> , which I described, we wanted to put a chaplain on every <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> of 1,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">A Jewish chaplain riding that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="714">All kinds of episodes occurred, all kinds of interferences, all kinds of problems, all kinds of strikes from the people themselves, personal problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">One authoritative American Army officer on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in uniform with his chaplain's insignia had a very sobering effect and a very salutary. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">So we didn't have the manpower, and the Army called back to active duty a dozen chaplains for a half year and we had the advantage of their services on that <span class="REGION">southern route</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So I have to say they helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I don't remember names. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">The first three guys I remember very well and very clearly. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">No, I didn't recruit because there was one, there were two fellows whose names | shall not mention who when I told them that we could use their help and asked them if they wanted to participate, they gave me such a chicken answer, we are here to serve the Army and we're not going to do anything else, we're not going to get mixes up in this business, this is political.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">QUESTION:  And you felt no incompatibility between your Army service and this work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="722">ANSWER:  No, it was a delightful synergy. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">It was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">First of all it was good cover, and secondly every time I involved Gls in this thing, I was teaching a bunch of Jews about their responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Come on, it was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">What am I going to do, give them lectures about VD. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I mean or go visit in the stockade. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I never was very good at that anyway.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="730">ANSWER:  Oh, come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I was asked after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> thing by a man whom I mentioned earlier, a rabbi by the name of Philip Bernstein who was a key figure. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">First he was the executive director, I told you, recruiting chaplains. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">All right, now we're not recruiting any more chaplains, but the commanding general in the German theatre beginning with Eisenhower himself, realized that he had to have at his disposal a person of high stature in the Jewish community to serve as his advisor on Jewish affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">That was the bureaucratic name, title of the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Because you're accumulating now thousands and thousands and thousands, tens of thousands of people, problems are going to develop, the Army commander says hey give me somebody here who can help me or without saying it, but on whom I can dump some of this stuff and I don't want to take the heat for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">I don't want to have the Army get into an adversarial position with these DPs. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">So there was a consultative arrangement agreed upon among five major Jewish organizations in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and the Department of War that whomever they would designate as a candidate whom they all agreed upon, the Army would designate that person, give him the simulated rank of a Two-Star General although he was a civilian and remained in civilian clothes, but for purposes of access in the Army Two-Star General puts him up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">You get two cartons of whiskey a month from the PX, and you get a certain kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and you get a driver, and you can call up anybody and you can say this is advisor Bernstein calling and the fellow looks at the list and he sees advisor to General McNarney or General Clay, oh this is a two-star guy, well you know, I've got to listen to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Bernstein was brilliant. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">The first advisor was a chaplain, a man by the name of Judah Nadich, a conservative rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="741">He remained with Eisenhower for about three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Eisenhower went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , Nadich went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">That's when the Army decided it better institutionalize this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Bernstein came and stayed, I don't know, a year and a half or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">Bernstein gets assigned to <span class="BUILDING">Army Headquarters</span> which are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">IG Farben building</span> , a great German industrial combine, huge, huge <span class="BUILDING">headquarters building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> bombed to pieces and this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> didn't have a <span class="DLF">window</span> broken because this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was designated prior and so informed the Air Force don't touch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">We've got to save something for eventual <span class="BUILDING">Army headquarters</span> , okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Bernstein's <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was two <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> away from General Clay. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I mean literally, couldn't be closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Bernstein called me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and he said hey listen, I don't know anything about the Army, Major-General Heichmoten, that doesn't mean anything to me, I am entitled to a military aid, I need you, will you come down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and be my military aid. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And I said I will be happy to on one condition, that he understood that I have Haganah responsibilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">QUESTION:  And you were able to say that directly over the phone and clearly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">ANSWER:  Well, all Army, at his level, all phones are what are called secure. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">They're constantly tested electronically for taps and you didn't have the kind of surveillance by satellite where today you listen to every long distance phone conversation in the entire world. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">NSA here listens to every single long distance phone conversation it wants to. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">If you want to talk to your wife anywhere and you say you don't want your privacy invaded, they say oh well we didn't invade your privacy, I mean the satellite was not working over your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> today. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I mean let's not get into that. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Technology wasn't advanced in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">So he said well I don't know what that means but, you know, come on down and tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">So I came down because I really liked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">We were intellectually close and spiritually close, we were on the same wavelength. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">That guy was as Zionist as I was from the day he was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I came down and I explained it to him and he said well that's fine, I'm all in favor of that, just don't tell me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Because the theory always is if the superior officer doesn't know or it works on the principle of what's called "The need to know." </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Phil said, I have no need to know so don't tell me, so then I can't be guilty of making any mistakes and I won't have to lie or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Very good, good arrangement. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">But anything that was to help <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or the cause was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And so, yes we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">The DP population we decided should get itself with some kind of authoritative, authorized base. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">What does that mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="771">There was something in existence which had gotten started right after the war called the Central Committee of Liberated Jews, and then there was a huge fight as to the preposition. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Liberated Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , Liberated Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Now, those two words tell the whole ideological difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">So the fight raged and finally they settled on of course "in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ," right. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Central Conference [committee??] </span><span class="sentence" id="776">of Liberated Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> became broadened as the camp population grew and grew to "In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="777">We then arranged a ceremony in '46 for a charter of recognition to be granted by the United States Army to the Central Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And the ceremony was held at <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Farben building</span> with a half a dozen of the DPs who were the chief officers of the Central Committee and half a dozen Major-Generals and so forth, and the photograph exists where General McNarney and Rabbi Philip Bernstein are side by side signing the charter of recognition. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Now, that meant that the officials of the Central Committee could travel on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Army vehicles</span> , 1t meant that they could -- quarter of a million Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="780">AT THIS POINT THERE IS APP. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">1 MINUTE OF INTERVIEW MISSING
QUESTION:  Were you with Ben Gurion when he visited a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">ANSWER:  I took him into one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , yes I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">He was on his way to the Ist Zionist Congress that was being held after the war and he remembered me from the first episode even though I didn't know him at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">So again I got a call from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> from his bodyguard, a fellow by the name of Mordechai Circus (Zirkes?), </span><span class="sentence" id="785">who said Mr. Ben Gurion wants to come into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and will you get him the necessary pass etcetera, and he wants to visit a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and you decide where. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">We had had a very terrible episode at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babenhausen</span> which was near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Let's say either Jews from the <span class="REGION">northern route</span> or the <span class="DLF">southern route</span> a trainload of a thousand Jews comes in. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And the trainload passed through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and comes up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is on the <span class="DLF">track</span> and their going to be put in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Now, what is this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="790">It's a former Russian POW, prisoner of war, camp maintained by the Nazi Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">As a prisoner of war camp the Nazis didn't care how they treated the Russians so there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , there were concrete floors with straw thrown on them, and totally encircled by a heavy chain link fence, barbed wire, <span class="BUILDING">guard towers</span> , machine guns, heavy search lights, the whole apparatus that looked like a bloody <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I'll never forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> comes around the curve, many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> , the same kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> that were used, a thousand people on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">They've been on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> now three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And they're being taken and they know by now through the grapevine that a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was a place where it was not good, but if you had patience someday the problem was going to be solved, and if you kept your hope up. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">So they were not resisting the idea of going into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> , but they resisted the idea of going into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which looked to them like an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And the bloody officer who had been told to tear down the <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> , take down the <span class="BUILDING">guard towers</span> , get some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> in there or some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> , none of it had been done. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">It was a typical bureaucratic slip-up, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">QUESTION:  Not malice, just --
ANSWER:  No, not malice, just ineffectiveness. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Sit down strike on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="801">We're not going to get off these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And boy there were enough agitators among them who were exercising the right of freedom for the first time to talk about their own fate and they say we're not getting off, and, it didn't take three minutes before that mood froze. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">And I was there, at a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> I like to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">When you asked the question before, I was in almost every one of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> all the time traveling, working for Bernstein out of the <span class="BUILDING">advisor's office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I set up a microphone alongside the track and tried to talk to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Nothing doing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="807">QUESTION:  In what language, Yiddish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="808">ANSWER:  Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Yes, Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I learned German in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="811">By the time my parents were married English was the language in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , by the time I was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">So I didn't know any Yiddish, but I knew good German. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And so every time I would appear before the DPs I would use German. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">One fine day an episode occurred which taught me a lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">There was a little fellow sitting in the front row and he folds his arms like this and I can see he's annoyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And I can hear him say in a low voice: "Red nicht kain Deitsch", "Don't speak German." </span><span class="sentence" id="817">I keep speaking German. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">A little bit louder he says "Ich forder a Yiddish wort", "I'm demanding a word from you in Yiddish." </span><span class="sentence" id="819">I don't pay any attention to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Finally he stands up and he shouts :"Oder Ihr red Yiddish , oder ich laeuf arois fun dannen", he says "Either you're going to talk Yiddish or I'm going to run out of here." </span><span class="sentence" id="821">So that taught me a lesson. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And I tried to twist my German around and ultimately I learned Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">So, yes, talk on the microphone to the people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> in Yiddish and nothing doing, nothing is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">General Keys, a Lieutenant-General, Three-Star Commander of the

for him, and they see all the stars and all the fruit salad on the uniform and they know, you know, who he is, I've told them who he is. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">It doesn't make the slightest -- they were polite but. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Colonel Ed Martin, the Catholic Chief Chaplain of the Third Army, a full Colonel, comes out. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">Nothing doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">Abe Heiman, a Major, the guy on our staff, the lawyer we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">The staff was three of us, Phil Bernstein, Abe Heiman and myself, nothing doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Okay, the first night they sleep in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="832">By the second day they're getting a little hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">We pass food up and down the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and bring out a whole bunch of <span class="INT_SPACE">Army field kitchens</span> to feed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">I mean that you could do with the snap of a finger. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">When the Army wants to cooperate it's easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">After enormous efforts in which they saw whole bunches of soldiers coming out with wire cutters cutting the barbed wire off, knocking down the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> , they saw it physically with their own eyes, and they realized they were not going into any kind of a trap, they dismounted from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="837">That was the beginning of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="838">That is not designed to create good morale thereafter. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">That's the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> that I decided to take Ben Gurion to. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">So I said, Zirkes, you want me to take Ben Gurion to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , I'm going to take him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babenhausen</span> , but you have to tell him that that's a very problematic <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="841">The episode of the initial strike took place some months earlier, but the mood in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> is still lousy, it never did get repaired. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">So okay, it's all right, the old man has been in tough situations before. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">We come in, there are about 5,000 people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , there 1s no <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> , there is no place for 5,000 people to sit, they're standing in what was the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> where the horses were kept, a big huge <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> like an <span class="BUILDING">airplane hangar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="844">There's a microphone, there is a <span class="DLF">wooden platform</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="845">Abe Heiman and I climb up on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> with the old man and he stands there, and we introduce him. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And there is a loud, cheerful, happy welcome because he, you know, he was a figure. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And the camp chairman came up and said we want to tell you how we feel and started to talk about the fact that life here is not physically dangerous, but life here doesn't have any meaning, what are we doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="848">We are trying to teach the children in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and we are trying to take care of the sick people and we tried to build a life and we have now our own camp police. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">They had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> and they had whistles and they had arm bands, they kept order. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">It was a sign of independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">We're doing everything we can, but it's all nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And so you're coming here today brings us the greatest hope in the world and we hope you have something to tell us. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">He stood up and he started to talk about what he was trying to build in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and what the efforts were that were being made on the great international political scene with the British and the Americans the Commission of Inquiry and somebody else. "</span><span class="sentence" id="854">Noch a mol a Commission", another time a Commission of Inquiry, who needs it. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">You know, we got a little heckling from the audience. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">But he tried to explain that there was a major push on in historic terms to get a state created and a free government to which they could come. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">But he wasn't going to offer them any immediate panacea, and he wasn't going to offer them any immediate results because he would be kidding them. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">He talked firmly, he talked beautifully, he talked honestly because that was his strong, his forte. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">He wasn't a manipulative politician. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">He was an ideologue. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">He had his own ideology, but he never tried to say anything to give people false illusions, false hopes. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">When he got through there was silence, no applause. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And finally he said "Listen, I have no certificates in my pocket for you, don't you understand that? </span><span class="sentence" id="864">But I am telling you that I do bring you hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Now, let's sing the song of hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I want to hear Hatikva." </span><span class="sentence" id="867">He had a monotone and he couldn't sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I have a monotone, I couldn't help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">The crowd slowly started kind of a crackling, crack, off key, but it began to build, it began to build some momentum and then it came out into full burst and there was a big singing of Hatikva by which time he was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">And that was the end of the meeting and he walked off and he was shaking his head. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And we got <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , he said "My God, I don't know what's worse, people being burned up in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> or people waiting 1n these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> without hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I don't know how to say which is worse." </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And then years later I read in his, you know, he wrote voluminously in his diaries, and I want to read here, I have just one paragraph, and I don't want to take his words. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">This is what he wrote "The people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babenhausen</span> finally understood that their unloved <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was not the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , but a way station on the <span class="DLF">road</span> to freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">The distrust and bitterness I had faced that day in October gave way in December to patient hope." </span><span class="sentence" id="876">December was the Zionist Congress in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">So he sensed the mistrust, he sensed the bitterness, he sensed everything, he understood it, but he said he believes that he gave them hope that their stay there was a <span class="BUILDING">way station</span> on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , it was not the end of the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And he and I for years after that, we saw each other very often in the course of the whole UJA career and the course of the years that I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> after that, and every once in a while he would get a glint in his eye and he would say let's talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babenhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Sort of a symbol to him, the <span class="BUILDING">way station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="880">So, yes, we used to go to visit lots of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and there were lots of problems and riots and Jews breaking out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="881">QUESTION:  When you look back on this period what do you see from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> was happening to the survivors in their journey? </span><span class="sentence" id="882">You mentioned hope.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">ANSWER:  Yes, that's what we concentrated on. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">We tried to concentrate, we tried to build up a sense that (a) there was a large group who cared, a group of institutions and individuals who and which cared for them, there was somebody caring for them, there was somebody looking after their welfare, there was somebody trying to take care of their immediate daily needs, and somebody trying to build a future for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And that was the basic message and we reinforced it all the time by active conduct. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">The Jewish Agency would give us a Singer or a piano player or somebody. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I remember a lady, Paula Padaney, a great pianist, and put her on the circuit and send her through 30, 40, 50 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , as much time as she could give us. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">We did all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">The Agency sent over about a hundred school teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">It grew even to more than that I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And we put Palestinian school teachers in the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> which were organized in each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to keep the kids busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">You did everything you could and you kept publicizing through the camp newspaper network every time a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> would go so that -- there was a dreadful thing called the Va'ad Aliya, the Committee on Immigration, I call it dreadful because it was operated according to the Zionist political key.</span></p>

ANSWER:  And with every reason to be flip about it or to be more than sarcastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I called it dreadful. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">It was not a humane way of handling this, it was a purely political way. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">The committee had on it representatives of every Zionist political party. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">The committee fought ferociously that if a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> had <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for 600 people each political party fought for its share of the 600 berths. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">No consideration of women and children first okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">That doesn't go anyway because you don't want to separate families. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">No consideration for family need. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">I mean we knew the populations in each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> so intimately. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">We never treated them as a mass, we always treated them as much individually as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">So it would be very easy to know if there are 600 <span class="NPIP">places</span> , give us the 600 neediest people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp A</span> , or give us 100 people each from six different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> so you'll build a moral in six <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that indeed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> are going and maybe someday they'd get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">There would be ways of doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">No, the political key operated. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Namely, each party argued what it's relative strength was and demanded the number of berths on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> according to its strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">My party is 13 percent of the Jewish people, I want 13 percent of the seats. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">If you ask him who he cares about, he didn't care about the individuals, give me 13 percent of the seats because when they get to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> they're going to be voters for his party because his party took him out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="913">QUESTION:  Let's go back for a moment, you say you knew the people intimately in that real sensing their needs. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">What were the needs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="915">ANSWER:  The needs were simply spiritual and non-material. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">They were psychological, spiritual and psychological. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">The people needed to believe that they would not be in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> forever, that this wouldn't be the end, that there was a different end. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">Now, they knew that they could always be repatriated back to their original land of citizenship. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">All they had to do was say to the Army, hey, I'm Hungarian so send me back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="920">That's not what they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">So they were waiting, waiting, waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Now, they're not hungry, they're not in danger, their medical needs are cared for, so what do they need? </span><span class="sentence" id="923">They need an uplifting of the spirit. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">They need belief and confidence that there would be a successful end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="925">QUESTION:  Did they want to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="926">ANSWER:  Well, there was always some number. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And HIAS at that time, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, was responsible for taking to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> those who wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">And some small number went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but the number was really very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">I don't know how to quantify it. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">HIAS every once in a while, some every few months, there would be a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and the trans-Atlantic vessels always had room for 1,200 people, 1,500 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">So I don't know, if there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> a month you were talking about 15, 20,000 people per year compared to the large number. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I say I can't really quantify it, and I don't know if anybody has got a statistic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="933">QUESTION:  What of Palestine representatives?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="934">ANSWER:  Oh, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Listen, <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , you talk about if you recite the Schmona Ezrei every day, if you do, then you're talking about rebuilding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zion</span> and rebuilding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="936">I mean it was bread into the bone from these people who came out of the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> of <span class="REGION">Eastern Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And even the sophisticated ones from the bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> had some memory of that tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">I'm not saying that there was a lot of religiosity in formal sense of that word. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Yes, there was a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and there was a rabbi in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and he took care of second marriages which were very frequent, people who married during those three and a half years in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , but you're not talking about a devout, you're talking about skeptics as far as religion is concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Belief in God, where was he, and maybe, and you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">But the ethnic and the folk traditions, the memories of holidays and the memories of food and the memories of basic prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">So they were all oriented toward rebuilding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">If you recited the blessing after meals, in the blessing after every meal, if you said it, 1s the "Benei Yerushalayim" etcetera, "in our day quickly." </span><span class="sentence" id="944">So that was their orientation. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I remember once there was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saosheim</span> and Eleanor Roosevelt came to visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">She stood up there and she was trying, she was kind of a good rabbel rouser, she always could get the crowd to respond to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">She thought that awakened the crowd out of any lethargy. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">That's the way she explained it to me later. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">We became friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">She said "Perhaps you do not want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , perhaps it takes too long, perhaps the British don't--perhaps you'll lose confidence, you'll lose faith in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Do you really want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="952">You know, the way the question was phrased was in order to evoke that massive roar. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">But she couldn't have evoked it if they didn't feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">They were almost homogeneously, almost unanimously zeroed in that that was the only future they had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="955">QUESTION:  When did you leave Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="956">ANSWER:  Leave Europe, let me think. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Let's see, there was the Exodus. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">No, no, I left before the Exodus. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">The Exodus sailed in, I think 1t was September, I'm not sure, but I think it was September '47, so right before that, August, July, summer of '47.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="960">QUESTION:  Why did you go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">ANSWER:  Why did I go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="962">A very interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">Professor Scholem, Gershom Scholem from the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> had come to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="964">We got a pass for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">QUESTION:  He's the great authority on Jewish mysticism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="966">ANSWER:  Jewish mysticism, a German Jew by origin, intellect to the nth degree, a warm Jew, loved to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , was not against his will, he was not dragged there unwillingly. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And he came on a mission in the uniform of UNRRA, United Nationals Relief and Rehabilitation. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">So strangers who came in on specific jobs will have to be in uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">It was a military empire there. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">So he wore an UNRA uniform and he had a 90 day permit and he was working in a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Offenbach</span> across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> where Alfred Rosenberg, the philosopher of the Nazi movement had collected several million volumes --

<p><span class="sentence" id="986">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="987">QUESTION:  Tell us a little bit about Gersham Scholem's visit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="988">ANSWER:  He received permission to come into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to visit and work in the <span class="BUILDING">Offenbach depot</span> of approximately 3,000,000 volumes which Rosenberg had collected. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">The intent of which was to form a basic library of Judaica which German scholars would study and find in the very Jewish sources the words with which to condemn the Jewish people as being parasites and destroyers and anti-Christ and everything else so that you would condemn the Jewish people out of their very own mouths. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">What came out of their mouths would condemn them. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">But somebody had to find it and collate 1t and synthesize it into one simple volume that then would become the property of every single decent person on earth. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And after we have killed their bodies we will then also kill their soul and their spirit. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">So this was the intention of Alfred Rosenberg and this was the process. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">Now, what was collected, literally actually collected physically, in that <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> were mostly claye kodesh and repetitious forms of the same prayer book in different languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="995">QUESTION:  By claye kodeshâ€™ you mean the holy books?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="996">ANSWER:  Holy books, the holy books. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">But among that mass of 3 million fairly unimportant volumes, from his point of view, there were 1,300 priceless incunabula, manuscripts handwritten from early Middle Ages and Scholem worked for 90 days like a beaver, slept in that same <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , sorting out 3 million volumes and had these 1,300 precious, priceless, irreplaceable items set aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">He packed them into five large wooden packing crates, each five feet by five feet, not impossible to handle, not gigantic, and labeled them. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And that's where the fear started. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">Because a couple of days before his time ran out he came to me and he said what are we going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I have applied for permission to take * "Claye Kodesh" are literally holy utensils. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">these to the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> , the monuments and fine arts section of military government in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> of the American Army, monuments and fine arts section, has refused me permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">They're the ones who allowed me to come and do the sorting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">They now refuse me permission to take these to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And at first they wouldn't give me an explanation for that refusal, and then I finally pushed and I got it, and the explanation was that there is a <span class="BUILDING">rabbinical seminary</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I'm not sure of the name of it, I think it's the <span class="BUILDING">Theological Seminary</span> which says that there is no reason why all of these precious things should go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">All of them or some of them should be placed in our <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , the greatest <span class="BUILDING">Jewish library</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , the greatest Jewish population in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">This is a clear reflection of the absolutely indifferent or neutral, I don't want to say anti-Zionist position of the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I don't even want to say the whole conservative movement in 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And I state this publicly and it can be interpreted as a condemnation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">I'm not trying to condemn anybody, I'm trying to say that they had a letter from the chancellor saying, and that had to be I think at that time, Finkelstein, that the Army should not allow, they should not send all these documents to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">They had been collected from all the <span class="NPIP">locations</span> in Europe whose descendants are either dead or have migrated to the new world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">So that was their sort of cool, cold objective reasoning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">The Army didn't want to get into an internecine Jewish fight so it put a hold on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And he was distraught because his time was up, could not be renewed, and he didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">Here he's got the stuff in five <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">packing cases</span> and what does he do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">Again you have to make a decision at a certain moment in time and you make it, and I said Professor, go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , relax, don't worry about it, I'll steal them, I'll get them out of the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and I'll get them to you, and don't ask me how because I don't know yet myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">I was sorry that he had labeled them because what was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> at the time was a very active <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> in pages of Beethoven and pages of Mozart, and one page was bringing hundreds of thousands of dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">Much later on when the story finally broke on the front page of the Stars and Stripes, and I can show you the issue which I have kept to this day, it listed the value of this treasure as $5 million. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">He went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">What I did very simply was on New Years Eve when it everybody was off duty or drunk I took a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">JDC ambulance</span> , drove it to the <span class="DLF">back loading dock</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">There was a Jewish captain in command of the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , his name was Benkovich, he was from some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , Jacob I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">I said listen turn your head the other way, I'm going to sign for these as though I am a man by the name of Koppel Pinson who was no longer in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , he had gone <span class="BUILDING">home</span> four months earlier --
QUESTION:  Koppel Pinson was the professor of <span class="BUILDING">Queens College</span> , a very distinguished historian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1023">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">And he worked for the JDC, the Joint, and he had permission to draw from that <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> in Offenbach books to be distributed through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to any <span class="BUILDING">children's school</span> or <span class="BUILDING">camp libraries</span> that wanted any of these books so long as the officer in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> certified that they were not irreplaceable, that they were just common ordinary books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">So Pinson had the authority to sign to draw stuff out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">I signed his name, put my initials underneath his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">He hadn't been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for four months already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Benkovich concurred with me, conspired jointly with me, and I said turn your head the other way and I'm going to take the boxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">So I took them out in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> , they just fit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And I hid the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> until such time as I could get the boxes on to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> where I intended to go to <span class="DLF">135 Avenue</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wagram</span> , which was the Office of the Jewish Agency, give them the boxes and say hey, deliver to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scholen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">They refused to take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">They wouldn't have anything to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">But they gave me a tip that did turn out to be useful, they said that Chaim Weizmann's <span class="BUILDING">library</span> was being shipped from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and it was stopping in the <span class="DLF">port</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> and I could get my boxes of books on to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and mix them in with his boxes of books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">They would get in to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> probably without being recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">The British didn't care about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">This was <span class="BUILDING">Weizmann's library</span> and Scholem's name is a professor, it was on the outside of the boxes so it would go okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1037">QUESTION:  And Chaim Weizmann was the leader of the World Zionist Movement and later became president of that --
ANSWER:  That's the same gentleman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">He lived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for decades and had accumulated a marvelous <span class="BUILDING">library</span> there and at this point in his life decided that he wanted to get it shipped over to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">An antecedent, precedent to his eventual move himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">So the thing was neatly executed, neatly done, and I went off on a short leave to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> because I wanted to see <span class="BUILDING">Hamlet's castle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">And a few days later I came back and found two CID guys sitting in my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> waiting for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">CID, Criminal Investigation Division of the United States Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">Very nice, sympathetic, friendly guys, not threatening, but very firm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And they said listen, Chaplain, you are now under investigation seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">This will lead to general court marshall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">We would just like to tell you that we have you dead to rights, but what we really do is we need your confession, that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">Now, here is your signature on the paper your signed to draw the boxes out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">Here is the number of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> of the JDC which you used to transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">Here is the number of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight car</span> on which you loaded them and on which you slept overnight from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> with the boxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Here is the number of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> you used to go from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">So, you know --
QUESTION:  They had done their homework.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1052">ANSWER:  -- what are you kidding about now, so would you just sign this please and then we'll get on with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">I went to Bernstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I stalled them and I said well listen, come on fellows, you know, I mean this 1s like a bombshell, I don't know what you're talking about, I haven't got any idea what this is all about, so let me try to rock it and sleep over on it and, you know, I'll meet you tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">I went to Bernstein and I said you remember our principle of need to know, well I think this one you need to know, and I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Without any more ado he picked up the phone and he called General Clay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">We're two <span class="BUILDING">offices</span> away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">He says General, I've got to come in and see you about something, and Clay always took him in immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">And it worked so well for us all the time normally. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And he told Clay and then he brought me in and Clay looked at me and he said why did you do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">I said because I didn't want the stuff to get stolen and lost a second time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">Those boxes wouldn't be secure in that <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , somebody would rip them open, somebody would see the stuff, somebody would recognize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">An antiquarian would be approached, the stuff has value. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And it was lost once. </span><span

id="1070">He said I have to ask you a formal question, did you have any intention ever of diverting any of this to your own use and selling it for your own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">He said I believe you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">He knew me reasonably well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">He said well, all right then here is what I'm going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">I am going to order that the boxes be brought back here because I am not going to get into a fight with the <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="1076">I said, sir, for God's sake don't do that, don't subject them to another voyage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">An <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> can go down, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> can go down, they are irreplaceable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">Don't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">There is an inventory, Professor Scholem has it, he knows what he put in the boxes, there are 1,300 items. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">Have the boxes opened in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in the presence of any authority you trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">There's an American Councel there attached to the <span class="BUILDING">British Headquarters</span> , take somebody, an American, a military or non military, have him stand there as the boxes are opened and check the inventory, and then leave it there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">If you want to leave it for future eventual distribution, good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">I'm not going to argue with you about that, but leave it there, don't move it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">So he looks at me, he said yes possession is 9/10ths of the law isn't it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">Once it's there it's there, isn't 1t? </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">I said, sir, don't get me into that discussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">So we immediately we had an understanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">So he said okay, it's a very reasonable suggestion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">So ordered, and I will so organize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Now, what do we do about you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">I mean this is a long answer to your question about what provoked my leaving the scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">He picked up the phone, called head of the CID, said I want you to kill the court marshall, that's out and over, I'm sending this officer back to the ZI, back to the zone of the interior. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">That's what the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was called as far as the Army overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">The <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> is the interior. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">So this officer is being dismissed from my command and will be discharged from the Army and so you kill the court marshall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">Finished just like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And he came back from the phone and he said, and the boxes will remain there, are you happy, he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">Perfectly satisfied. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">Now, it's between Scholem and your surrogate, whoever your person is over there in charge, and I'm satisfied that it will work out the way we hope it will. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">So I was given orders to go back and be discharged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">That story ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dix</span> in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> and the customary procedure there is that when you're being discharged they ask you a bunch of questions, have you returned your gas mask, have you returned your rifle, blah, blah, blah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And one of the questions is, do you wish to remain in the United States Army Reserve Corps retaining your commission and advancing in rank. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">So the Sergeant who is reading all of this to me, you know, he's doing it by rote. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">All of a sudden he stops himself, do you wish to remain and he said oops, he said that doesn't apply to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">There is a note here that you are not authorized to remain in the Reserves, you are out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">That's how that ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">That was after being four days in the stockade for a whole other story because Morgenthau. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">Henry Morgenthau who was the head of the UJA said I need you to go around with me making speeches in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and you've got stories to tell that will help raise a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">And I said but I have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dix</span> and be discharged. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And he said well, I'll call the Secretary of War and I said no, sir, call the Ist sergeant at the <span class="BUILDING">separation center</span> and he said I don't deal with sergeants, I deal with cabinet members. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">So I said well then get something in writing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">He did indeed call Secretary of War Patterson, who told them over the phone yes you want to keep this man with you 30 days, absolutely, in uniform on detached service to you, I'll write the orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">I never got a copy of the orders, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Dix</span> never got a copy of the orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">I had gone back 30 days later and I'm arrested at the <span class="DLF">gate</span> for being AWOL, absent without leave, and the Chaplain of all people to be absent without leave, I mean how can you do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">It took me four days to convince them to give me a dime and let me make a phone call. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">And then the commanding officer, general somebody, was told by Morgenthau yes I had the man on duty with me and I will get you a telex from Secretary Patterson and you'll have it in ten minutes, this guy came back to me in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> , he gives me a cigar and he says don't hold anything against me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">I said come on, come on, you don't think I know the racket well enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">No, of course it's not against you, it's against stupid Mr. Secretary Morgenthau, he didn't get me anything in writing, the Army goes by what's on paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">The end of the story in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> was the American guy witnessed the opening of the boxes, agrees that not a piece 1s missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">They nail the boxes up again and they take them up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mount Scopus</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">Now, we are talking about 1947, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">In the war in 1948 we lose <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mount Scopus</span> , don't we? </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">So the boxes are up there now once again in jeopardy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1125">QUESTION: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE"> Mount Scopus</span> was that section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">east Jerusalem</span> that the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> was built on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1126">ANSWER:  Originally.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1127">QUESTION:  That the <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew University</span> was built on originally, and during the '48 war between <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> --
ANSWER:  Was lost to <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1128">QUESTION:  -- was lost to <span class="COUNTRY">Jordan</span> , but an Israeli contingent remained on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mount Scopus</span> but there was no access to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">ANSWER:  Okay, so this Israeli contingent, 140 men, were allowed to inhabit a <span class="DLF">trench</span> between the <span class="BUILDING">Augusta Victoria Hospital</span> on the one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and some other marker on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> which was on the apex of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> on the top of the <span class="DLF">ridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And these 140 guys were a symbolic Israeli presence to validate <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> 's previous ownership, and hopefully ultimate future ownership, and it was one of those cockamamie arrangements that was part of the armistice treaty and this group of 140 men sat up there for two weeks and played cards and twiddled their thumbs, couldn't do any training, couldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">They were in the <span class="DLF">trench</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">It was dreadful duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">You could only keep them up there two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">Every two weeks they came down under supervision of a UN convoy team which escorted them down the <span class="DLF">hill</span> to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">UN truck</span> at the bottom which took them away and replaced them with 140 other guys who stayed up there for two weeks, so there was a rotation, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">The end of the story is that it took several years for the 1,300 items to come down, one by one by one, tucked under the shirts and jackets of the rotating platoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And every piece came down finally to: " Sof hadavar": At the end of the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">And Scholem had the privilege of putting them all in the rare <span class="INT_SPACE">book room</span> of the new <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Givat Ram</span> , what was then the new <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">I don't know what it is now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And I saw him, the last time I saw him was a couple of years ago before he died, and I said I have to make sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">I saw a story once in the Jerusalem Post by Abraham Rabinovitz who wrote the story telling about the bringing down, did it all work out, did you really get them all in the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">He said every last one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">And we shook hands and that was the end of the story and it was the last time I ever saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">So that's what happened to the books, that's what happened to me, and --
QUESTION:  Then you went on a national barnstorming tour on behalf of UJA?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1144">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> , the original congregation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">I went with Morgenthau who was the chairman, and then I went with Edward Borger?. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">For the next several years, let's see, this is from '47, for the next eight years, the next eight years, I was a volunteer chairman of the Speakers Bureau for the National UJA and I was out three or four days a week, Monday through Thursday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for the weekend, Shabbat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Anybody wants to get married we collect all the people and we do it on Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Anybody wants to die better do it on Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">By Monday I'm off again and running. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And eight years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Twice in that interim they came and asked me if I would become the professional director of the organization and I turned it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">But then after a while Mr. Warburg and Mr. Rosenwald who were the two ranking chairman of the of the UJA, both from those aristocratic families they really said look you must do this, there is nobody like you, nobody has your background, nobody has your experience in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , not only what you did in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , what you have done here, the public knows you now in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and you know the leading big givers in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , you've been talking to them as a volunteer, now become our professional head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And there was a big shuffle, a long story, I don't want to get involved in that, about the bonds and the newly organized bond organization of which I was one of the founders and fully agreed to and didn't see why there should be any fight in any community between the UJA and the bonds, and that was a very precious attitude to have because so few people had it at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">At the beginning there was dreadful fear and competition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">One lay leader sticks in my mind as a man who rose above it and that was a man from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> by name of Joseph Meyerhoff and he said, he was marvelous, he said the way I will prove this is that I will be the chairman of the UJA drive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> and I will be the chairman of the bond drive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> and I will do them both in the same year and I will separate them so that they don't impinge on each other, and he was role model number one of what a good lay leader should be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And we trotted around the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> together for years, he and I. And his son now is the Chairman of the Council of the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">So the bond organization needed somebody to run it, and the UJA organization needed somebody to run it, and the big boys in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> got into the act because this was, we're talking heavy money, so Eshkol got into the act, Menachem [Nahum?] </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Goldmann got into the act.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1161">QUESTION:  Eshkgol was the Finance Minister and later Prime Minister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1162">ANSWER:  Later Prime Minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">And then Menachem [Nahum?] </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">Goldmann was President of the World Zionist Congress following Chaim Weitzman.|[?] [</span><span class="sentence" id="1165">Nahum Goldmann was president of the World Jewish Congress] So when the heavy weights got in and came pressing on me I really couldn't say no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">I shifted in the interim from being the rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> to being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milwaukee</span> , and they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Milwaukee</span> and they spoke to the board and they said you've got to release this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">So they did, and I did and that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">Then I switched over from being a volunteer to being the executive, the CEO, of the UJA, and did that until the '70s when we left and moved over to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for a period of years, with every intention of remaining. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">Got diverted because of some family illness and wound up back here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1170">QUESTION:  Let me touch on two issues we haven't touched on, on the European experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">What was the attitude of the DP population toward the Germans, and what was it like for them to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">And let's start with that for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1173">ANSWER:  It's really a serious question and it's easily answered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">The DPs lived mostly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">There were no machine guns aimed at them and there were no guards at the <span class="DLF">gates</span> , but they were in an encircled area, they were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">A few of them were out and were living freely in rented quarters among the German population, they were comfortable doing that, but 99 percent were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">They used to look through the <span class="DLF">wire</span> around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and they used to see Germans going on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , carrying little briefcases, going to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was working and everybody was living a normal existence except they. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">They hated the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">They resented them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">They didn't envy them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">They just would like to have torn every German apart if they could get their hands on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">Now, they could because as I said they were not confined, they went out into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> near which these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were located. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">They bought goods in the <span class="BUILDING">German stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">They learned to speak German, many of them did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">But you could see the look in their eye and they hated every German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">Every once in a while some episode would flare up and you would see the expression of it in a physical form of rebellion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">And I'll just tell you one story which illustrates many many similar things that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">It was in the camp at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1190"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where Hitler was in <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">In that very same <span class="BUILDING">German Army barracks</span> in which he was imprisoned in 1925, yes, '24, '25 when he wrote "Mein Kampf," are now living Jewish displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">So you can imagine what an irony that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">Okay, in this camp at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsburg</span> one day a rumor spread through the camp that a Jewish child had been kidnapped and killed by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">Immediately a riot started through the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and a wave rushed out of <span class="DLF">gates</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and started to break <span class="DLF">store windows</span> , start <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> on fire, over-turned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , attack and pummel any German passerby, quickly the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> turned into an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">armed camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">The purpose of the Army was to keep law and order. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">Here it was breaking down between Jews and Germans, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">That's dynamite, that's incendiary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">So the Army pushed the Jews back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and closed the <span class="DLF">gates</span> and padlocked them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">Okay, now you have U.S. troops ringed around and a couple of 50 caliber machine guns are brought and set up and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tank</span> is hovering delicately in the background but present, visibly present. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And so the Jews start yelling "Amerikanische SS, you American soldiers are acting like the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">Amerikanische Nazis." </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">Well, now the lieutenant in charge of this platoon says whoa, whoa, we're not Nazis and we're not here to hurt you, but you can't come and tear and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and the dialogue goes and the Jews boom!, </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">burst out of the padlocked <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> once more and break the <span class="DLF">gates</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">Then the scuffle starts between American troops and Jewish DPs and Germans ringing around looking at it with great pleasure, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1205">QUESTION:  Now you guys have your Jewish problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1206">ANSWER:  19 young fellows get arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">They were the ones at the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">So they were the activists, and one of them has a knife in his pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">Later when they're arrested and they are brought into the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> and one of them has got a piece of lead pipe in his pocket, and one of them has got a hammer in his pocket, and anything that could be used as a weapon, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">So they are charged with, I don't know what the technicality of the charge is, but it's disturbing the peace and it's inciting to riot, and nobody was murdered and nobody was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">By then incidently it is discovered that the little boy who was missing was not dead, that there was a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="DLF">fence</span> at the back of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> going right into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and he had gone out there and he had wanted to do whatever, maybe he wanted to smoke a cigarette, nobody knows, but nothing had happened to the kid and the kid had came back in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And so the whole rumor that had started the whole thing was of course inaccurate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">But by now you've got 19 fellows in the stockade. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Word of this gets back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">There was a Congressman from <span class="REGION">Illinois</span> by the name of Adolph Sabboth, an old guy, he was about 80 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">He informed the press and the Department of War that he intended to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and himself make sure that these Jews got an honest and fair treatment from the American Army and the American Army wasn't going to treat them like the Nazis did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And he's shaking his fist in everybody's face. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">And of course word of this gets back to General Clay and this is exactly what he needs his advisor for, so General Clay says to me you go down to -- Bernstein says to me you go down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsburg</span> , you sort this thing out, you make sure that these guys get a proper defense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">They're in front of a court marshall of seven officers, so it's going to have to be a military officer who will have to defend them and there will be a military prosecutor, and I want you there as my personal representative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">And you have all of my authority and you report to the commanding general that you are there on my behalf so he knows who you are and you follow this thing every step of the way because this is dynamite. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">Okay, the end of the story very quickly, I went to the Judge Advocate General and I asked him for the best lawyer he had in the United States Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">And he tells me that guy who handles all death sentences given by courts marshall for murder, rape, all the felony one kind 1s a captain by the name of Abraham Heimann, and I say fine, I want him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">Heimann said if I get mixed up in this DP business I'll never get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">I'm due to be demobilized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">I said Abe, come on, come on, come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">And to make a long story short he came on and he came down and he was the defense attorney and he defended them as well as he could and brilliantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1227">QUESTION:  And he didn't get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for five years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1228">ANSWER:  He did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">He wound up as the last, the final advisor when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ferinwald</span> ?, </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">the final <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> closed in 1950 Heimann, the last advisor, went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> finally in 1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">So anyhow, the trial ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">They were given three months which was, you know, the admonitory slap on the wrist with time off for good behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">So they probably might have served, you know, three weeks, four weeks, something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">However, Heimann pleaded and obtained for the right that they should not be put in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> with Germans, they should not be put in a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> with American soldiers in the stockade, they should be put in some separate <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the Army can have a few guards and watch over them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">And we find an old abandoned <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> nearby, quite nearby, so their families could come and visit them, and within four weeks we had all 19 of them out and on their way through the Aliyah Bet and they were taken off <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and that was the end of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1236">QUESTION:  Let's touch on one more question which is really more a historical question, but also part of your own experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">July 4th 1946--
ANSWER:  Oh, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> , the Kielce Pogrom, is that the one you're referring to? </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">Oh, that was a bitter one, bitter, bitter, bitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">42 Jews were killed that day and the bodies were laid around the <span class="DLF">fountain</span> in the center of this little medieval looking <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , a beautiful little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and the bodies were like cord wood in a circle around the <span class="DLF">fountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">A ripple went through all of Europe, and of course it reached <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and it reached <span class="BUILDING">Army Headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">And General McNarney who was the commander at that moment said to Rabbi Bernstein, take my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> , go over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , go to wherever you have to go, find out what's going on there, find out what caused it, find out what it's implications are, and what the consequences might be, if any, for us here in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">Because he knew, he was sophisticated enough to know that this was going to trigger off another flood of people leaving the east and trying to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> where they would be safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">We did, we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">Unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">We went to see the American Ambassador whose name was Arthur Bliss Lane. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">There was only one <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and the Polonia, and it was half smashed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And he had two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , the American Ambassador had two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> in this <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">That's all he had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">No <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And he had gout and his foot was up on a hassock and he was mean and he was miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">And he said listen, this has nothing to do with me, don't talk to me about these Jews and what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">It's not an American problem, it's not an embassy problem, it doesn't involve anything, it doesn't involve a consular division, it doesn't involve reparations, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">And probably whatever happened to them they damn well deserved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">That was his parting shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">Thank you, sir, Mr. Ambassador, very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">We went to see the Prime Minister, Mr. Edward Losupka Morafska. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">Quite bland. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">I really, you know, there is some latent anti-semitism among the Polish people, everybody knows that, that's historic fact, I don't know what triggered if off, I don't know what caused it, but it will die down the way it always does. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">And I mean there is nothing that the Polish government will or can or should do about there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">There are no culprits, we can't find anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">We go to see the Cardinal, Augustus Cardinal Hlond, H-L-O-N-D, a bull-necked, cropped hair, tough as nails. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">He never asked us to sit down, the whole interview was standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">And his attitude was very simple, these Jews brought Communism here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">The head of the Communist party running this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is a Jew by the name of Yacob Berman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">Whatever the Polish people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kelts</span> did to those Jews they did out of anger and fury and rage because the Jews have put this anchor around our necks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">And the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> will do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">We tried and we asked him if he would write a pastoral letter which should be read in every <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and this would kind of put a blanket on the -- he wouldn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">So our fourth visit we went to Mr. Berman, and Yacob Berman says if the Jews are guilty of having brought Communism here to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> it's the best thing that we could ever do for this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I will take whatever consequences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">And furthermore, if the consequences are that a few Jews get killed, well a few Jews get killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">It's just a few more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">We are fighting for a whole new world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">And he was a Communist idealogue and he believed it and he preached it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">And we're fighting for a whole new world means for everybody and for a larger number of Jews, and even if there were a few casualties there always are in war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">And the last point I want to make with you gentlemen is that they should remain here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">If you came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from the American commander to find out if the Jews here are going to flee, if I have anything to do I will see to it that they will leave this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> nakt und barfuss, they will go out naked and barefoot because they shouldn't go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">Well, you know, this was zero for four. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">We had seen four people, the Ambassador, the Prime Minister, the Cardinal, and then the Communist leader, and you get no sympathy from any of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">But then when we started to go around and we began to talk to the Haganah guys who were working in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and we began to talk to ordinary Jews whom we were recommended to, we got the picture that they're packing and leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">And we returned and we wrote the report to McNarney that he could expect, that the military command in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> could expect over the period of the next year to a year and a half approximately 150,000 people to come flooding in from the east to the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">And the Army had better gear up for it and prepare it, and the Army would have a political decision to make, not a military one as to whether the <span class="DLF">borders</span> should be closed or opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">And if you want to close the <span class="DLF">borders</span> and you want to try to prevent these Jews from coming in then you're going to have to do it by armed force or setting up <span class="DLF">barriers</span> and <span class="DLF">blockades</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">McNarney looked at that and he said well, whoa, this is way over my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">Bernstein, go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> please and talk to the President. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">A decision about whether the border of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> is open or closed to 150,000 refugees is not for me to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">So Phil did, he flew to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and talked to Truman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">It took about 15 minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">He got an immediate green light, and he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">Okay, McNarney has got a green light from the President, the <span class="DLF">borders</span> are open. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">So Lippman is on the <span class="DLF">Czechoslovak border</span> and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, the <span class="DLF">borders</span> are all manned with our people and that is what raised the ultimate total to 250,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">It's just as simple as that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">That was the final result of the Kielce Pogrom. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">Those 42 victims triggered off a major demographic shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">And the accumulation of that many people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> itself had the political influence plus the episode of the Exodus to produce that vote in the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> in November of '47. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">By November of '47 everything is falling into place.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1295">QUESTION:  Let me push this phase to the close by asking a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">Where were you on May 14th 1948, or where were you on November 29th '47?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1297">ANSWER:  I don't remember the latter date where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">I was probably -- no, I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> in '47. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">Of course, I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> November 29th '47. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">May 15th '48 I was shuttling between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilmington</span> , <span class="REGION">Delaware</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1302"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wilmington</span> , <span class="REGION">Delaware</span> had to do with DuPont. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> had to do with the <span class="BUILDING">Haganah headquarters</span> 1n the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> which was in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , 14th East 60th Street. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Next <span class="DLF">door</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">Copacabana nightclub</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">The director of the Haganah in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was Mr. Teddy Kollek, now the Mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> , a world famous figure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">So Teddy had ordered me when I returned to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , he reminded me that I was still in the Haganah and never mind I was running around making speeches for the UJA, that's kid stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">As far as the Haganah is concerned it's real stuff, and he wanted me to, contrary to the embargo laws of the United States Government, to buy, pack, ship out of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> all the dynamite, brick production, of DuPont. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">A brick is a brick, the size of a brick, the size and shape of a brick, but this brick is a piece of dynamite. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Now you take three of them, stack them up one on top of each other, and take three more, one on top of each other, and wire the six of them together and attach the wire, whatever length you want, to a detonator and you blow up that package, we called it a satchel charge because you took the six bricks, put them inside of a knapsack, you know, a canvas GI knapsack, it looked like a little satchel, it should have been called a knapsack charge more accurately, and it will blow a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in a <span class="DLF">stone wall</span> or it will blow a <span class="DLF">hole</span> through an <span class="DLF">iron gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">And that was the main artillery that the Israel Armed Forces had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">It didn't have any big artillery, it didn't have mortars, Howitzers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">So I was buying the dynamite, shipping it to myself in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Denver</span> , trans- shipping it down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tampico</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Mexico</span> , buying <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vessels</span> , getting the stuff on board in cardboard cartons that said "Del Monte peaches, fruit salad, pineapples." </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">We stole the cartons from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Del Monte</span> , <span class="REGION">California</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">And the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> were manifested to the <span class="REGION">Far East</span> , but when they went out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tampico</span> they didn't turn and go through the <span class="DLF">canal</span> to the <span class="REGION">Far East</span> , they went to the <span class="REGION">Mid East</span> , in the other direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">So that's where I was all through '48. '</span><span class="sentence" id="1316">48 was a hell of a year with me and the FBI. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">But everything came out okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">No charges, no nothing, and a happy ending to the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1319">QUESTION:  Herb, is there anything we haven't touched?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1320">ANSWER:  No, Michael. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">No, I think we've covered the main things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">But the summary of the whole business is that you had a population that had the patience and the stamina to overcome all of the evil and the agony they had been through, all the losses they had suffered, and who had the hope and the faith in something they believed in that represented their future. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">So the patience and the stamina, the faith and hope characterized that DP population. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">With all the hatred boiling in them, with all of the stuff that many of them have never gotten out of their systems for their whole lives, that's one element. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">Then you've got the other supporting elements. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">You've got the group, you've got the United States Army, benevolent, friendly, cooperative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">I can't compliment them enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">Number two, you've got the group of American Jewish organizations that came in with dough and support. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">Number three, you've got the Israelis, the Palestinian personalities beginning with Ben Gurion himself and the whole mechanism of the Haganah and their support that they provided. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">And then lastly you have won over world public opinion so that you get that great ringing majority vote of two when the resolution was finally passed in November of '47. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">It won by two. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">The two <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> were the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Guatemala</span> , great big Democratic powers that pushed the ball over the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">But that was the combination. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">Now, we've talked about the DPs themselves and we've talked about the Army and we've talked about the JDC and the great organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">We've talked about the Haganah and the Israelis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">The world conscieuce, feeble as it was, did its trick and the State was created. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">And I sum that whole thing up when I think of myself and my life and where I am now and what did it all mean, I really believe the following statement, and it may sound strange to you, those three years from 1945 when the war ended until 1948 when the State was established, those three years I think are the single group of any three years in the entire history of the Jewish people, and I mean every single thing I can think of that we've been through since Abraham, I don't think there is another period of three years which has ever been so determinative. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">Because we came out of the death into the life and those are the two extremes, death and life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">There aren't any others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">There is nothing similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">Persecution and inquisition of this one or that one, or running from one <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , running from another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , that's all blips on the screen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">But this is the definitive thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">We could have passed off the stage of history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">There's no doubt in my mind about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">One third of the people dead in Europe, one third of the people paralyzed and ineffective in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> during the crucial years, almost another third of the people lost behind the Iron Curtain, you couldn't get to them, they couldn't be useful or helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">The Jewish people almost died, I mean totally and finally and irrevocably. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">And out of that three short years later you find you're back into vibrancy and action and you're winning a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">That's a miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">I don't know any other miracle, and I'm even talking about the crossing of the Red Sea, and I'm talking about anything else you want to mention, I don't know of anything else that's comparable to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">So if I had the zekhut, the merit, to live through those three years, work my way through those three years, add something, well then it was a life worth living. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">And that's how I sum it up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1352">QUESTION:  A story worth telling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1353">ANSWER:  And a story worth telling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1354">QUESTION:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1355">ANSWER:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">End of Tape #3 Conclusion of Interview </span>
