QUESTION:  And what was the date of your birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  March 26th, 1920.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And the place of birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  <span class="REGION">St. Louis County</span> , <span class="REGION">Missouri</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Could you talk about your childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Well, perhaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I was born just two months before my father passed away and was raised by my widowed mother, along with two sisters and a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">We grew up during the Depression and unemployment times and all of those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We were a happy family led by a devoted Christian mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And there was nothing terribly unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I guess we were probably a typical Depression family. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> through the first year of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and then due to economic problems and so forth I had to drop out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And we moved to a small -- very small <span class="DLF">farm</span> down in the Ozarks, near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salem</span> , <span class="REGION">Missouri</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">I lived there two years and then moved back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> and were able to find some employment. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And that was in 1935, I believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  So you were 15 then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  I was 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Yes, ma'am.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  And you were working, at 15?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  I went to work at age 15 as a helper for a painter and paper hanger, and then when I left his employ I went to work for a newspaper carrier delivering papers via old Model T Ford truck. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And then I was working for $0.10 an hour in both jobs, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And then in 1936 midyear I went to work for a <span class="BUILDING">manufacturing company</span> at age 16 out in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And I worked for that <span class="BUILDING">company</span> for 16 years and worked up through an apprenticeship and became a certified tool and die maker. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And then I went to work for another <span class="BUILDING">company</span> as a tool and die maker. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And then I -- During this time I was going to <span class="BUILDING">trade schools</span> and night courses at <span class="BUILDING">Washington University</span> and other <span class="BUILDING">vocational schools</span> in the <span class="REGION">St. Louis area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I changed to a job as an engineering assistant and a product designer, attending more and more <span class="BUILDING">night school</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I took a correspondence course 1n electronics and operated a part-time radio-television repair business during the early 'SOs. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I was married in 1940 to my wife Rachel, to whom I'm still happily married 57 years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And I changed jobs after another 14, 15 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I held about four jobs, I guess, four or five jobs in my lifetime and worked my way up into semi-executive position. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Again, a happy career, a very interesting career. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And we've had a very, very happy, sometimes turbulent life. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">With God's help, we always kept it all together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  Now, backing up, what led up to your going into the Army”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  I was 26 years old at the time, and they were getting ready for the invasion of Europe and the D-Day invasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Now, you were born in 1920?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  1920. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I was 24. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I went 1n in 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">QUESTION:  When you were 24?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  When I was 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  And were you drafted, or how --
ANSWER:  Yes, I was drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I had a responsible position and had had a couple of deferments. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">But at the time I was drafted and they were getting ready for the invasion, anybody under age 26 that was healthy, there was no more deferments.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  What was your position when you were deferred?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Well, I was a tool and die maker and engineer assistant. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I was -- our company was doing some very precise and important war work, and I was a nighttime supervisor.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  Do you know exactly what your company was manufacturing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  Well, we manufactured some small parts for the M1 rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And I designed the tools and built them for that job. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We were making a lot of plug gauges and ring gauges for the cartridge -- for rifle and pistol cartridge cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">The small-arms plant in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">St. Louis</span> was manufacturing the product, and we were making tools and gauges for them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  So you were very directly involved in production for the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  So in 1944 when you were 24, you were drafted?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  And where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  I went through <span class="BUILDING">Jefferson Barracks</span> , was held there a couple of weeks and in the hopes that they would have a request for some Army engineer candidates or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">But all they were getting was requests for infantry replacements. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">So after a couple of weeks I was shipped down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">IRTC training camp</span> by -- let's see. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">It was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Robinson</span> , <span class="REGION">Arkansas</span> , down by <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Little Rock</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And I was in a training program there for 17 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And then I was given a short delay in route and then shipped over to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and went across the <span class="DLF">channel</span> in -- I think it was probably September of '44 -- I'm not terribly sure now. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">August, September. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And I was held in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">replacement camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for a while and then sent to -- across the <span class="DLF">channel</span> to a front area replacement camp in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Do you remember where in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  I think it was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Epinal</span> , E-P-I-N-A-L, I believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  And from that point then I was assigned to the 45th Infantry Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And we had -- I think I joined that division a day or two before or maybe a week, I don't know, before Thanksgiving. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And we had early Thanksgiving dinner at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or wherever we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We were in reserve then. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And then we went up into the action into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vosges Mountains</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace-Lorraine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  So that was the first action that you ever saw?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  And could you say a little bit about that experience?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Well, I guess I couldn't say anything good about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I was fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We saw some -- quite a bit of action during that fall and winter, in the spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But I was fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">I never received a wound in combat at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">The only wound I received was at one time when we were off the <span class="DLF">lines</span> picking up replacements, and I had a bazooka blow up in my face, knock me down. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And I didn't even qualify for a Purple Heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">I was blessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  What was your injury at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  I had a lot of powder burns on my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">It stunned me. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">When I picked myself up, I had blood all over my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">But like I said, I was fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">It really didn't do a permanent injury. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I had some scars that showed here for a while, but I suppose they're gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Were you out of action for a while?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="96">QUESTION:  You just kept going?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  Just kept going. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We had been pulled off the <span class="DLF">lines</span> for a few days to pick up some new replacements. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">The 45th Infantry Division had a lot of casualties throughout the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And they were one of the divisions -- the first divisions, as I understood it, over in <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And then they came all the way up through <span class="REGION">Sicily</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and <span class="REGION">southern France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And of course, I had joined them way up in <span class="REGION">northern France</span> up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsace-Lorraine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They had seen a lot heavier action before I even joined the unit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  So how did that period end?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Well, our unit was -- I don't know exactly how to -- We were up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> on the <span class="REGION">7th Army front</span> at the time that the so-called Battle of the Bulge took place over on another <span class="NPIP">front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And our unit as well as some of the other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> had to pull back from the <span class="NPIP">position</span> we were in because we were being surrounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We spent Christmas Day or Christmas Eve up in the <span class="DLF">foxholes</span> up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And we were actually I think had crossed over into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And then just a day or two or a short time after Christmas, we had to pull back during the night and take new <span class="NPIP">positions</span> further back. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">A short time after that -- and this gets real fuzzy there -- I was sent back to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> , suffering from battle fatigue. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I was all stove up with, I guess, arthritis or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We had been in the snow and the water and everything up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And during the time that I was -- the days that I was back, three or four days, I guess, my unit was actually cut off and captured or killed by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I'll never know why I was spared that. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But as a result of this, our unit -- I think our whole battalion and parts of another battalion were rendered inoperative, I guess you'd say. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">A lot of the men were taken prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We were pulled back then and attached to some other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And I don't know -- I don't remember what <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">units</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But then we were reorganized, and still then the 157th Infantry, Colonel Sparks was still our battalion commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And we then started to move forward --
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I'm going to move the microphone a little closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  We started moving rapidly then into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">This is during the latter days of the war then. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We were traveling on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vehicles</span> and heading across -- I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I think they call it the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Saar Valley</span> , but I'm not now of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Some <span class="DLF">country plains</span> in that <span class="DLF">farmland</span> probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We participated in the capture of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schaffenburg</span> , which was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">industrial town</span> ; <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> ; and then moved -- our next objective then was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And as Colonel Sparks' narrative in the one book that I was reading down in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , 1t was on our way to objective in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> that the division came across the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau Concentration Camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  So by then, you had seen quite a bit of combat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  Enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So your next objective was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  Or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I'm sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  Our next objective was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">However, we were diverted then to liberate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And I think, as I mentioned earlier, our sister company -- our battalion was given the objective of liberating the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Our sister company, "I" Company was in -- went to actually -- they were one of the first into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> "</span><span class="sentence" id="142">L" Company, which I was in, moved on in to occupy the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And then we were -- as soon as they saw the situation there and --
QUESTION:  The situation in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> -- </span><span class="sentence" id="145">and the seriousness of it and all, then as I understand it our Munich objective was delayed and the colonel was told to fully liberate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> guard it until the military police could come in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  So what specifically did you experience in the liberation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  Well, like I say, it was a few hours or the next morning after the <span class="DLF">gates</span> were crashed that our company was pulled in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We were billeted in some <span class="BUILDING">apartment buildings</span> outside of the camp where the Nazi officers had lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And we were put on guard shifts -- I don't remember -- several hours at a time inside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> around the camp was -- orders for no one to go in or out. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">There was a lot of typhus in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="151">There was all kinds of sickness. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">My understanding -- and my numbers may or may not be right. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">But my understanding was that at the time we got there there were about 17,000 prisoners in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and that they were dying at the rate of about 300 a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They didn't -- obviously didn't want them out in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So while I was in there doing guard duty, we talked whenever possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">A lot of the prisoners in there would come up to our guard post and want to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They were overjoyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And they would tell their personal stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  Now, what language were they speaking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  Well, some of them could speak English, but some of them were strictly speaking their German or Polish or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  Did you understand any of the --
ANSWER:  At that time, I could understand some German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  How did you know German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Just from picking it up and talking to people and prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  So from being in the military?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Yeah, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I never studied German. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">No, ma'am.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  One or two of the prisoners then insisted on taking myself and another buddy for a tour of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where they were -- where they slept in these boxes that the pictures all show. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I guess had we known then about all this typhus and everything, we probably wouldn't have gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">But anyway, they took us through there and they took us through the --
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Your hands are making a noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I'm sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I'm a little nervous, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Took us through the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Of course, there was a lot of the prisoners still in the boxes. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Took us through the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span> where we saw these emaciated men being given <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> and taking <span class="INT_SPACE">showers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We then went back to our guard posts. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And this sort of thing was repeated for several days. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And I think we were there four days altogether. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And we had some interesting and some sad stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">There was one man came up to me and was speaking English. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And come to find out, he had been a musician with one of the Dorsey bands, and he had gone over to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to settle a family estate or something and he'd been captured. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Now, whether he was Jewish or not, I'm not sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  He was American?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  He was an American, but a musician. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">But anyway, he -- of course he was wanting to tell us his story. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And he was really overjoyed because he had family back here. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But some of the sad stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">One young Polish boy tell me in -- I guess in broken German, English, whatever -- we understood it -- that saw his parents butchered in front of his eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">And another one told us about seeing the Nazis take these infant babies and throw them up in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and shoot at them. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Things of that sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">That's where it's hard to visualize, really, anything or anybody being that animalistic, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">QUESTION:  Let's go back to what you actually saw yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">When you went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> the first day, did you go in with other men on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="197">ANSWER:  Uh-hmm. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Went in -- probably marched in. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I'm not sure of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">And then what we saw, of course, was the bodies laying out by the <span class="DLF">fence</span> such as in that picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">QUESTION:  Now, could you describe the picture? </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Because this is just an audiotape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Well, here on the back of this picture it describes just a few of the bodies which had been carried out of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , dead, and not hauled to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And these bodies were just laid out like sticks of wood out by the high <span class="DLF">barbed wire fence</span> , and they were waiting to be burned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  Now, this is a photograph that you took?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  This is a photograph that -- yes, with a camera that I had taken from a prisoner.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">QUESTION:  From a German?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  From a German soldier prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And these bodies were just almost like skeletons. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And then there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> on the <span class="DLF">siding</span> , probably more than one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But there were bodies still piled in there that had been -- the Germans brought these people from some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that didn't have <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> , and they hauled them there and then they burned them. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">This photo is one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> with the side <span class="DLF">door</span> open. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Here is another photo of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And after we got in and were given duty assignments, we were given a tour by some of the prisoners which included the -- they showed us the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> where they lined up the concentration prisoners and had them undress and go through the -- what they thought was going to be a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , a delousing shower. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And they marched them into these <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and gassed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">And then right in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> next to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> was a large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that had the bodies just thrown helter-skelter, just mounted up like cord wood, again waiting to be burned in the <span class="BUILDING">furnaces</span> which were in an adjacent part of that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">The fires were still going at that time because they were -- I suppose it was important to dispose of these bodies that were diseased and had died of disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  So after the <span class="DLF">gates</span> were opened, the bodies were still being cremated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="222">ANSWER:  So far as I remember it was, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">That's a detail I don't remember for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">I'm pretty confident they were because the fires were still burning and the bodies were piled up. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">There would have been probably more disease, danger and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Well, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I guess that's that and our visions of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and talking with the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  Let's go back to what you were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">You marched into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And what was the next thing that happened to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">ANSWER:  I'm not terribly sure, ma'am.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  Well, you said that you were on guard duty.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Well, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">We were -- I don't know whether they took us in through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> immediately or whether we marched to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and then were farmed up and assigned duty or what. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">But I know that within a matter of minutes or hours of our arrival, we were actually inside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  So your guard post was inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  Yes, ma'am. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Most of them were. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">There was some I think out of the gates and that too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  But you were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  And what specifically were you told to do at your post?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  You know, I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I think probably just to make sure that there was no going in or out and no -- probably no fights or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">There was so much turmoil then and there was so many ethnic groups, prisoners and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I'm not terribly sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION:  Do you remember anything that you had to do as far as your guard duty? </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Any fights you had to break up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  No, I don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">There were some cases where I think some of the prisoners perhaps tried to call attention to some of the -- maybe some of the Nazi guards who had put on a prisoner uniform to try to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">But I don't remember a specific case where this was -- where they pulled my attention to that or -- it was just so much confusion at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And these men -- these prisoners were so joyed to be liberated and eager to tell their stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I guess 1t was probably all we could do to keep them off of us, if you know what I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Just picture a crowd pushing. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Like this one photograph here. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Here is a group of them that were -- this is a small group of the prisoners expressing their feelings at being liberated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">QUESTION:  In looking at the picture, what feelings do you see that they're expressing? </span><span class="sentence" id="261">How would you describe the picture?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  Well, most of them seem to be smiling. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I see one man there making a face of some sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Here is an old man sitting down in front here that's head down, probably maybe not even -- he might not even have been normal emotionally at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Because I'm sure a large percentage of them who had been in there very long, 1t would have been hard for them to keep their mental stability. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">It was hard for us to keep it. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It happened -- and you may be aware of this -- that when our sister company went in there first, they were so upset about what they saw that they actually lined up about 40 or 50 of these Nazi guards and just mowed them down with machine guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And another eager officer from another unit that was there almost got court-martialed for killing these guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">But it was the sort of thing you would really expect because our soldiers were so torn up emotionally at seeing this type of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  We have to stop and turn over the tape.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Thomas Gardiner, Tape Number 1, Side B. Mr. Gardiner, you were talking about your sister company and how difficult it was for them and for your company to deal with all of the emotions that were involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">You mentioned when they first entered they had lined up some of the German guards and machine-gunned them. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Did anything like that happen with your company”?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Because within the few hours that it took us to get in there, I think all of those guards that they'd found had been eliminated, probably, either killed or taken prisoner.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  So the circumstances were a little different?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  Yeah, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">QUESTION:  But you said that you were billeted in the <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> of the German officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">What were they like, the <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  They were some pretty deluxe <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Yes, they were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  Could you describe more specifically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  Well, they were well-furnished and seemed to have -- be well-decorated and -- and I suspect there were probably maybe nicer than what the equivalent officers in our military would be furnished. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">There was nothing second rate about them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  So after about four days, your company moved on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And then we moved on into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And we saw very little action between there and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> because <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was falling apart at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I think some of the other units, maybe in other parts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , may have had some combat getting in, but our <span class="DLF">entrance</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> was pretty peaceful. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And so we moved into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">We were -- We took over a section of middle-class family apartments and were billeted in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> for I think about a month and guarding important installations, utilities and things of that nature, I guess water supplies and everything there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , until a military government unit could move in and take over there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  And then what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  Well, then we were packed up and shipped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> out to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> , A-U-G-S-B-U-R-G, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">It was not too far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , I don't believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">But we were put out there and billeted in some <span class="BUILDING">farmhouses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">This was kind of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">farm village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And we were there I think about a month, just marking time, waiting for reassignment orders, and were taking some exercise and routine training while we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And not anything really exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I myself and one of my buddies who happened to have woodworking as a hobby before the military were given an opportunity to work in one of the <span class="BUILDING">local cabinet shops</span> on military materials -- exercise equipment, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I don't remember what all we did make, but we had the free use of these <span class="BUILDING">cabinet shops</span> and it was kind of a pleasant break from military life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">QUESTION:  And then what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">ANSWER:  Well, then we were packed up and put on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> on the so-called 40 and eights, 40 horses or -- 40 men or eight horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And we were shipped to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Le Havre</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I think we traveled several days there. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And we were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent camp</span> then, awaiting reshipment back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">And our division was scheduled to come back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> for a short leave and a couple of months amphibious training. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">And then we were scheduled to be shipped over and participate in the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">While we were in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">tent camp</span> , the A bombs were dropped, much to our happiness because that eliminated the need for us to be invading <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So that's -- That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">We were shipped back to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> then on some of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">victory freighters</span> or victory-sized <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">They hold about 2,000 troops, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And we got back to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">We were given 45 days leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And then those that didn't have enough points for discharge had to report to some other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> down in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And I was one of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I wound up down in -- well, two different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> down in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And from that point I wound up being able to negotiate a discharge. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">My company was still doing some critical work, and they interceded for my release and returned to my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And my wife had become pregnant during my 45 days leave, so I headed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">QUESTION:  Was that your first child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Yes, ma'am. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And we had been married six years when he was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And he was very much wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">That's the heavyset fellow that was with us out here in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  So how was your readjustment to civilian life after all of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  Well, in a way I think it was much easier than a lot of the fellows had because I had a job to go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I had a loving family. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I wasn't hanging loose like so many soldiers were. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">It took some months, I think, to overcome the emotional part of it because I've always been sort of an emotional person anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And I used to have nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">I'd stay up sometimes until 2:00 or 3:00 o'clock in the morning, working in my <span class="BUILDING">hobby shop</span> just until I could get sleepy enough to go to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">I guess gradually the trauma went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I still 50 years later sometimes get a little bit emotional when I get to talking about it or if we see a war movie or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">But I guess that's quite normal too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  And what about your experience at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Is that something that you have thought about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  I have, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">I was never a racist. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Never in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">I was brought up to not be. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But through my experiences in the Army and then in Europe and then especially at seeing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and seeing what racism could do to people, I came out with an obsession of not letting myself or any of my family ever become racist towards any ethnic group or color of people or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And to this day, that's held pretty true. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Because that's what caused most of that turmoil in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">The Nazis had to pick out somebody to blame the world's troubles on, and it happened to be the Jews and the non -- other non-Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And I don't see that. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">I believe very much in judging people as individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And I think it -- it helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">Those memories has helped me be a stronger Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I was led to be a Christian on the <span class="DLF">battlefield</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I had a battlefield conversion. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I've tried to live it all my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">And I think being an active Christian, one must work actively against any kind of discrimination activity or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I've never been an activist in terms of joining any group because that's a form of hate itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">There's things like these Klu Klux Klan and some of these militia groups in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> now and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Well, they're hate groups that if they were allowed to be out of control, they would be just as heartless as the German Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Some of the things they've done have been very similar.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">QUESTION:  Just before this interview, I understand that you saw the exhibit in the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">QUESTION:  And why did you want to come to see the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">ANSWER:  Well, I guess partly to refresh my own memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">But I think more than anything because my oldest son had been here once before and had been kind of shocked by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And [| had talked to him about the things that I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And I had let my children see these photographs that we took and had emphasized to them that they must appreciate that it was real, the holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">It wasn't propaganda and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">And my son really wanted me to come out with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And I guess that's the primary reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">I guess if he hadn't come out here initially I probably never would have. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">But he brought a book back from here and I read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And then we both bought the book, the Schindler's List book, saw the movie, and then there was the sequel to the Schindler's List, the Schindler Legacy or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And I guess it just refreshed memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And then my son developed a friendship or a business relationship or something with this Jewish man down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> who was from a survivor family or something, and they got to talking about collaborating on writing a book or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I guess my involvement then has been more a matter of trying to support my son in a worthy endeavor than any personal desire on my part. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">It didn't open my eyes to anything new here, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">It maybe just emphasized the immensity of the things that went on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="380">QUESTION:  Is there anything else that you would like to talk about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="381">ANSWER:  Not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Not really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Well, thank you very much for telling us your story. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">It's very important, and we appreciate your giving your testimony.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="386">ANSWER:  I hope that it's somehow, some way maybe helps to prevent a reoccurrence at any time, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="387">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Tom Gardiner. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Conclusion of Interview </span>
