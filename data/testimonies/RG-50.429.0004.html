<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Marty, I’d like you to begin by telling me your name, where you were born, date
ANSWER:  My name is Martin Irvin Glickman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">I’m usually referred to as Marty Glickman. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">At the age of 6 I moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I was raised in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  And what year were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  I was born in 1917. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My parents came from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">They came over about 1912. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I don’t remember exactly when. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">I wasn’t around when they got here. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But I was born in 1917. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Lived originally in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your childhood and your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  My father was not an extremely religious person. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">As a matter of fact uh he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We observed the High Holy Days. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Occasionally on Shabbat we’d go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , only occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My grandfather and grandmother on my mother’s side were, kept a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> uh with the two sets of dishes and the silverware and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I was bar mitzvahed. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> and uh I raised my own children in the Jewish faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And my two sons were bar mitzvahed. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">My two daughters were not bar mitzvahed, but we have a Jewish background, a Hebrew background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  Was that very important to you as a boy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  It wasn’t uh very important in terms of my uh, uh grand feeling about Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I was like any other kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I, I was brought up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhoods</span> , mixed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Uh we lived amongst Italians and Irish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Why don’t you start that again because you’ve sort of conflicted yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">What kind of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> were you brought up in demographically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  I was brought up in a, a mixed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I was brought up in a, a mixed Irish, Italian and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">There certainly were as many Jewish boys around with whom I played as there were people of other faiths. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And I didn’t feel unusual about being a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Uh many of my friends went to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> with me and many of my classmates in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Uh it was uh nothing out of the ordinary being Jewish in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  Then you didn’t feel any anti-Semitism from the non-Jewish kids? </span><span class="sentence" id="37">1 2
ANSWER:  Occasionally we’d get into a fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Uh I had an older cousin who was a big strong young man and he fought with an Italian boy one day because he was called a Jew Bastard. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And uh he got into a fight, and uh I’m pleased to say that my cousin won the fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But I never actually uh struck a blow because I was called a, a Jew Bastard or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Uh as I say I was amongst Jews most of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  So you really never felt in any way slighted because you were Jewish or you never saw that as something that you’d have to rally against?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  I never felt as though I, I had to overcome the fact that I was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I was aware however that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And uh, uh the great athletes of the day uh, Venny Leonard was my father’s hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Another great prize fighter named Leach Cross uh was a man that he admired greatly. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And uh Hank Greenberg was one of my early heroes. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So I was aware of Jewish athletes and Jewish competitors who did well. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I wanted to do well also to show that a Jew could do just as well, perhaps better, than anybody else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  Then there was that distinction. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">How important were sports and how did you get involved in sports?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  I got involved in sports because I was always the fastest kid on the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I could run faster than anybody else could run. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And, and uh I found this true until I ran against Jesse Owens, He was the one fellow I couldn’t beat, never could beat him. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But other than that I was, as I say, the fastest kid around. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And because of that I had an advantage in any sport I played. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So I played, punch ball, and box ball, and ring-a-leaveo, the games kids played in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And when I started playing basketball or baseball or football, because I had the speed, I had an advantage and so I could be perhaps better than some of the other guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I could almost steal first base in baseball.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  So you started sports at a fairly early age?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  I started sports, I started my first running when I was uh five years of age I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Uh we used to run around the <span class="DLF">block</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And uh we’d start in opposite directions, I and my opponent would run off around the <span class="DLF">block</span> and we’d come back to the same <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And the first one returned to that <span class="NPIP">spot</span> was the winner. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And uh the older guys in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> would match me against some of the older boys there because I could beat the fellows my age rather handily. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And I almost never lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I don’t remember losing a race until I ran against Jesse.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Now when did this running and sort of neighborhood sports become sports in a more organized fashion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Sports for me became more organized when I went to <span class="BUILDING">Junior High School</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Montauk Junior High School in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And uh I played on four different 2 3 teams. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I was a catcher on the baseball team. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I played on the basketball team. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">We won a city championship in, in basketball. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Also won a city championship in baseball. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Uh I ran on the track team and I was the field day champion. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I was the fastest runner in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And of all things I swam on the swimming team. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And in those days athletes played all sports in season. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">In the spring and summer you played baseball. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">In the fall you played football. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">In the winter time you played basketball. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And all year round you ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I don’t ever remember walking as if as a young person. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I always ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">It was just my nature to run.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  So sports were very important to you it seems.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Sports were critical to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Uh my life was built around sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And I think it began when I started reading the Merrywell books. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Now uh those of you who are my age may well remember the Merrywell books. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">They were written by Bert L. Standish and Frank Merrywell was the premier hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">He had a younger brother named Dick Merrywell who also was a great athlete. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And Frank Merrywell married and had a son named Frank Merrywell, Jr., who also was a great athlete. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And I wanted to be like Frank Merrywell junior or senior or Dick Merrywell. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And uh the exploits of the book, I started reading them I guess when I was 12 years of age, and I wanted to duplicate those exploits. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">He ultimately went to <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Became an all — American football player, basketball player, a champion in all the sports he participated in and a, a well — rounded All — American type person. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">I wanted to be Frank Merrywell. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">I still remember his, his, his girlfriend’s name whom he married. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Her name was Inez. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I married a person named Margery, but I met her in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So it was uh, uh it was my, my goal to be like Frank Merrywell, this fictional character.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  Then your goal was to be this quintessential All — American guy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  Yes that’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I wanted to be the uh as good as I possibly could be in sports and also be a good student, because Frank Merrywell was a good student. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I, I wound up being, I would say, uh a B student. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Uh I never had problems passing a, a courses in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I was uh a fair student.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  So there is actually one story I’m curious about. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">When you talk about how active you were in sports and how they really were your life at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Did you think that you had a future in sports, that you might be thinking in terms of Olympics or an athletic career?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  I never thought in terms of having a future in sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">I never aspired, for example, to be a, a sports announcer. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">That came through my uh the good day I had, the best day I ever had on a <span class="DLF">football field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But the only reference I recall as to having aspirations in sports was in my uh <span class="BUILDING">Junior High School</span> graduating year when I was all of 14 years of age. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">My homeroom teacher, a man named Hugh Brown, who was an alumnus of <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , wrote in my yearbook — be seeing you in the 1936 Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And I thought that was very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I was a fast runner in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But 3 4 uh I was only 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I didn’t think in terms of the Olympic games, but he predicted it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  After you read that did you think ah ha maybe that is where I’m going or is that something I should aspire to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  I didn’t think in terms of the Olympic games until I was uh well into my uh freshman year at <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Uh I was a, a school boy champion as a sprinter. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">I was the, the city champion, the state champion, the national sprint champion, but I didn’t think in terms of the in terms of the Olympic games because I, I was still a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I was 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And uh only in my freshman year when I began to win against important competition did I realize I had a chance to make the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And when I won the metropolitan championships in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> and then the Eastern Olympic trials up at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> against a great sprinter named Ben Johnson. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">When I beat Ben he was uh, uh, he was uh the world’s record holder at 60 yards indoors, and when I beat him I realized then just a, a month before the Olympic games that I had a chance to make the Olympic team.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  I’m going to ask you to repeat one sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Not the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">When you said something about not until I was in my freshman year. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Can you say not until I was in my freshman year in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  Not only my freshman year in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> did I realize that I had a chance to make the Olympic team? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I was uh a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> champion, New York City sprint champion for several years, and New York State champion. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I was also the national interscholastic schoolboy champion. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I and I knew I could run fast, but I didn’t know how fast I ran until I ran against uh some of the better sprinters in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and was able to beat them, particularly a fellow from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> named Ben Johnson, an outstanding sprinter. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">He was the world’s record holder at 60 yards indoors and when I beat Ben, beat him a couple of times, I realized I had a shot for the Olympic team and that was at the end of my freshman year at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  Having all of a sudden this thought or goal, was there anything different about being a Jewish American athlete than just being another great athlete?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  In my <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> years and my <span class="BUILDING">junior high school</span> years, there was nothing different about being a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish high school</span> athlete certainly not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I’d competed against everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And uh I felt no different than other athletes in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">It was only in my uh freshman year at <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span> that I became aware of the fact that I might have been a little bit different when at my first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">training table</span> meal as a freshman, I asked uh at lunch, the very first meal, please pass the lamb chops, and everyone laughed at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , because they weren’t lamb chops. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">They were pork chops. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So I realized then I was a little bit different than most of the other guys on the football squad. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">4 5
QUESTION:  Did it motivate you differently? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Did you think about it differently when you competed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">ANSWER:  I was always aware of the fact that ’'m a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Uh never unaware of it under virtually all circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And uh even in uh the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> competitions and certainly at <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and uh for the Olympic team I wanted to show that uh a Jew could do just as well as any other individual no matter what his race, creed or color and perhaps even better. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And uh it wasn’t until uh the, the circumstances developed in the Olympic games when I was refused the opportunity to run in the games uh because of the fact I’m Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  At this time you’re a little bit older, you’re a little bit smarter about what’s going on in the rest of the world, were you more aware of the restrictions applied to Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I mean in your, in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> growing up it was very mixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">It didn’t seem to be an issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">But were you aware that there was anti — Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , that you couldn’t go everywhere you wanted to and that sort of thing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  I was certainly aware of the fact that there was anti— Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">My grandfather and my father, my uncles, told me about the pogroms in Europe and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">They’d heard about the pogroms in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as well and in other parts of Europe and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and I was aware of uh anti — Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> I was also aware of the fact that there were certain places I was not welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I might go into a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> for example and uh see a small sign where you registered uh which read restricted clientele, which meant in effect no Jews, no Blacks allowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">There were certain areas around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> where you couldn’t live. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Darian</span> , <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> , for example was a place where Jews were not permitted to own <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Darian</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And uh I was aware of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Uh my folks would tell me and my in — laws later on uh told me about reservations they made at a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> and my father — in — law’s name was Dorman and uh neither Jewish or Gentile, and he would try to check into a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> having made a reservation at some <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> and being turned away when they found out he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">He might check in as Jack Dorman, which he was, but his friends and associates might have names like Goldberg or Cohen or Goldstein and the group was turned away uh upon occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So I was aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I was aware of anti— Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and throughout the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  How much in the early 30’s did you know about what was going on in Europe and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in particular?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  I knew practically nothing about what was going on in uh <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> uh specifically and in Europe generally, except that I’d heard about the pogroms in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> basically as I mentioned in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Uh but I was not specifically aware until my freshman year at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> when as a political science major I began to learn of the uh anti — Semitism that uh some of the Fascist countries were subjecting Jews to, particularly in Nazi Germany. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">There was anti — Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And there was anti — 5 6 Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">The uh Nuremberg laws as I understand it were passed in 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I was aware that there were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  I think 35. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">There were restrictions from 33.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">ANSWER:  I’m sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  ...Start over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I, I, I was aware of the Nuremberg laws which were passed in 1935. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Um Hitler had come to power in 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">As a political science major at <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span> , I was aware of those anti — Semitic laws, but these were merely on the books uh like the laws perhaps, not going to certain <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> , not going into certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> , the unwritten laws, or the law about not crossing against a red light if you’re crossing the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Uh they were not seriously spoken nor seriously taken in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">We were aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">But how, how they affected individuals I didn’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">QUESTION:  And you didn’t have any family in Europe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="189">ANSWER:  At that time uh the family I had in Europe uh were my father’s brothers who uh lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> and were still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">But uh I didn’t know how they were affected by it at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">It’s just interesting to know, you know, what you knew before going over to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Tell me about qualifying for the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">How did that come about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  I qualified for the Olympic games by winning a series of races to qualify for the final trials which were held at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Randall’s Island</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> uh the first use of that Randall’s Island Stadium for track and field championships. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I qualified by winning the metropolitan championships and then the eastern qualifying round up at <span class="BUILDING">Harvard Stadium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">There were Eastern, Near — Midwestern, Western, and Far western trials and I was the winner of the sprint in the East so I qualified for the final round. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">It was a series of qualifying rounds and I and about, I would guess, 14 other sprinters qualified for the final round. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And 1n that final round I qualified and made the team.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">QUESTION:  How did you place in those final rounds? </span><span class="sentence" id="201">What happened there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">ANSWER:  Uh the placement in the final round, in the actual finals, I qualified by finishing second in my uh in that semi — final heat uh at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Randall’s Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">And uh I’d like to tell the story of uh my first race against Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Uh these two were the two great black sprinters of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Uh we drew uh, uh marbles which we numbered for the <span class="DLF">lanes</span> in which you ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I drew <span class="DLF">lane number 5</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Jesse Owns was in <span class="DLF">lane number 4</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Ralph Metcalfe was in <span class="DLF">lane number 6</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And 6 7 I’m in <span class="DLF">number 5</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">So here is Owens, the world’s champion, alongside of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Metcalfe, who’d run and won a silver in the 1932 Olympic games, on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">These two magnificent athletes on either side of me and I’m scared stiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I mean I was shaking so that when the starter called us to our marks, to put our feet in the <span class="DLF">starting holes</span> , we didn’t use starting blocks in those days, you dug <span class="DLF">holes</span> with a trowel. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">When I started to put my front foot, my left foot, in the <span class="DLF">hole</span> , my foot was shaking so I could not put my foot in that <span class="DLF">starting hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">It was just vibrating so I couldn’t put it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And all six additional sprinters on either side of me were on, on their marks, getting ready to go, and I’m still standing there shaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And the starter called everyone up and called me over to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I knew the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Uh he’d started me in some of the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> races I had run, and he said Marty walk up and down a bit, take a few deep breaths, relax, jog up and down, relax, and we’ll try to start again. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And after several minutes uh I was calmed down sufficiently to get my foot into that <span class="DLF">starting hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Both feet in and we raced. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Uh I don’t remember the gun going off. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">We were set terribly tense of course on our marks, and then set, and then I was running. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And there was Owens on my left and Metcalfe on my right and for forty yards I’m running even with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And then suddenly as though they were on an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">escalator</span> and I was not they were pulling ahead and moving ahead. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And I fought as best I could and I kept dropping back. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And uh then I realized I wasn’t going to catch either one of them and I thought I finished third in the race. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Uh so much so that uh Ted Using who was broadcasting the race on the <span class="DLF">infield</span> of the <span class="DLF">track</span> , he was the leading <span class="DLF">track</span> and field broadcaster of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Uh Ted called me over after the race and said here’s Marty Glickman, the kid from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> who finished third. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Oh wait a second he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I see they’ve placed Frank Wycoff third. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Marty finished fourth. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And he interviews Frank and then he says now here’s Mar, oh just a moment he says, uh they’ve placed Floyd Draper in the fourth place, Marty finished fifth. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">So he interviewed Floyd Draper and then he, he interviewed me finishing fifth. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Which is where I was placed. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I was a bit upset about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">Uh films from the race indicate that uh I beat Floyd Draper by a foot uh. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Very little question about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">As for Frank and myself, you could, you could choose the winner between the two of us, but uh, uh I didn’t know whether I beat Frank or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Nor did he. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Uh later in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in a post — Olympic meet I beat Frank but uh, uh we were virtually in a dead heat for third place. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So I, Iso remember Dean Cromwell finishing uh, uh it’s too long already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">I guess I’m asking was there something that happened there, that was a precursor of anything else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  Well Dean Cromwell, Dean Cromwell leads to another story which has to do with the selection uh my ouster from the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So uh if you can fit this in. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">As we finished the race, I noted that Dean Cromwell, the assistant head track coach of the American Olympic team and the head track coach of the University of Southern California, was in amongst the officials, arguing with them that Frank Wycoff had finished third and Floyd Draper had finished fourth. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Because he was the coach of <span class="REGION">Southern Cal</span> and Wycoff and Draper ran for <span class="REGION">Southern Cal</span> or had 7 8 run. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Wycoff was graduated. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Had run for <span class="REGION">Southern Cal</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="251">These were his boys and he pushed them amongst the officials uh as finishing third and fourth. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And I was placed fifth. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I don’t know whether I finished third, fourth, or fifth. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I just don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">But I do know that Dean Cromwell had a hand in the placement of the order of finish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  And you think it was clearly favoritism, not the fact that you were a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  I think it was clearly favoritism that uh he wanted his boys placed third and fourth. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Uh the fact that I was Jewish I think did not matter at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">He wanted his boys in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And uh I had made the team anyhow because the first seven men were to make the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">The first three finishers running the 100 meter run, and the next four finishers making up the 400 meter relay. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So I had made the team.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  Any other Jews on the team?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  The other Jew on the track team, one other Jew was Sam Stoller. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">Stoller was placed sixth in the 100 meter final. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">He finished behind me. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">He ran a poor race. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Later Sam beat me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic Village</span> in a trial race we had amongst the three of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Sam Stoller finishing first. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I was beaten by a shoulder by Sam, and we both beat Floyd Draper. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Floyd Draper wound up running on the team.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  We'll get to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Now after you qualified for the Olympic team, what sort of preparation was there between those qualifying rounds at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Randall’s Island</span> and going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">ANSWER:  We qualified for the Olympic team uh on a uh Friday and we were on board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> I believe on Tuesday, heading for uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">It was almost immediate. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Uh we were measured for our uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Uh there were several events we attended, uh several ceremonies we attended and we were aboard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> uh within three days after making the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">It was very quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">There was no training period or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We stayed in shape, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">We kept working out every day to make sure we were in good condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And we took the S.S. Manhattan for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">QUESTION:  Now this sounds pretty exciting. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I don’t know how much you had traveled before then, but winning these rounds and then a few days later being on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> going to Europe sounds like a big deal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  This was quite an experience for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I had been no farther than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I’d been no further south than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> until that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I was uh this 18 year old kid from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I was the second youngest kid on the team, on the track team. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And here I was aboard this magnificent <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">liner</span> heading for Europe and uh it was a most exciting time. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Uh it was wonderful, it was thrilling, it was, it was great. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">It was fulfilling my Frank Merrywell dream partially. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">8 9
QUESTION:  What was it like on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was uh informal. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">It was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Uh we, we trained aboard the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">It was a, a five day crossing and a sixth day getting uh to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and then down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Uh but we had no opportunity to really sprint aboard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So we did calisthenics, we jogged up and down, we did a great deal of walking aboard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">We uh watched our diet fairly carefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Uh there was no specific training regimen because we were all pretty good athletes, had our own different coaches and coaching techniques applied to us for months and years beforehand. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So we were not concerned with uh being uh directed by the coaches who were on the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">It was a fun time. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">It was, it was a time that was loose and easy and pleasant and, and we looked forward with great anticipation to getting to Europe and getting in competition. (</span><span class="sentence" id="305">end of Tape 1 of 4) Tape 2 of 4 (five seconds)
QUESTION:  I want to backtrack for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Prior to your going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , do you remember any conversation, any newspaper articles, any talk of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> boycotting the Olympics because of what was going on already in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="307">ANSWER:  At the time we were competing in the uh regional finals and then the finals at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Randall’s Island</span> uh the talk was so slight that I truly was not aware of the possibility of a boycott of the 1936 games. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">It had very little play in the press if any. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I don’t remember seeing it in the newspapers or hearing it on the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Asa matter of actual fact, no Jewish organization like B’nai Brith or uh ADL or uh the American Jewish Congress if there was an AJC then. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Uh no Jewish organization nor any individual ever said to me, Marty don’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">There was no talk, general talk, of boycott. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I know now that there was a vote taken involving the AAU, the Amateur Athletic Union, and the American Olympic Committee and that uh they voted to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Uh but there was no such publicity or promotion such as existed in 1980 when the President of our <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , Jimmy Carter, uh strongly recommended that we don’t participate in the 1980 games. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">There was no such popular movement at the time of 1936.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">QUESTION:  And you weren’t aware that there were athletes who had decided not to go on their own?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  I was not aware of any athletes who decided not to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I know now that athletes uh say they decided not to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">There was a fine sprinter whom I never met, never ran against, fellow named Herman Newgas, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tulane</span> , who determined that he 9 10 was nor going to try out for the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Uh he didn’t go, he didn’t try out for the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">But I knew that later, in later years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">QUESTION:  So this was just not an issue?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  The fact of going or not going was not an issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Not as far as I was concerned nor in terms of the public press or the populace generally. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Uh we didn’t think in terms of not going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">QUESTION:  Tell me about the trip over, the anticipation, what it was like being on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">ANSWER:  Being on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Being on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was a brand new experience particularly for a kid from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> or any of us who’d never been abroad. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">Uh I’d been no farther north than uh, uh than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I’d been no farther south than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philadelphia</span> , and here I was uh an eighteen year old kid from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> uh heading for Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Uh had been, a name, a place my parents came from, going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and uh visiting other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Our first stop for example was uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span> with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Just stopping there and seeing it in the distance and how beautifully green it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">We stopped in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> momentarily at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plymouth</span> and I could, uh I couldn’t see the Plymouth Rock or anything like that and uh, uh but it was <span class="REGION">Plymouth England</span> and then we went across to uh, uh <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to uh, uh landed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> down into the uh heart of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to the huge <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bahnhof</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">QUESTION:  What was going on on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="336">What was the mood? </span><span class="sentence" id="337">People were I assume fairly excited.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="338">ANSWER:  All of us were pleased at having made the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And uh the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was wide open. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">In those days a huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> uh like the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> uh had different classes, first class, second class, uh cabin class or whatever, steerage even. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Uh but we had the run of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And uh, uh those we ate in what amounted to uh the uh second class <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> , we were not in the top categories of <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> , we had huge menus to choose from. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">We were not given <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">training table</span> food. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We selected our own foods. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">There was a fellow on the team named Tarzan Brown. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Uh an Indian, Narragansett Indian from <span class="REGION">Maine</span> who’d never seen a menu like this before. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And Tarzan was a marathon runner. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">He weighed perhaps a hundred and thirty pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Uh, uh a great marathon runner. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">He’d won the Boston marathon. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">On the team and we had uh this huge menu. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And every meal, every day, he ate the menu from top to bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I mean six appetizers, and two or three soups, and four main courses. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">In those six days on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> uh he might have put on between 10 and 11 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">He ran the first mile of the marathon and uh then he sat by the wayside and uh gave it all up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION:  How were you spending your time on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="357">10 11
ANSWER:  We spent our time on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> talking, uh working out, uh calisthenics mostly. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Jogging up and down on some of the very short, straight aways on <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">Uh there was no facility to really work out the way we would have ordinarily on a, a <span class="DLF">cinder track</span> or a <span class="DLF">clay track</span> , certainly no quarter — mile track aboard <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Uh but we, we stretched, uh we jogged, we walked, we did exercises and uh we talked and we read and uh, uh generally it was a group of guys having a good time together. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">There were women on the team as well, but uh, I guess I was not involved nor interested in any of the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I had a girlfriend who later became my wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">QUESTION:  Was there any special camaraderie amongst the few Jewish athletes on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  There was no special camaraderie amongst the Jewish athletes except a, a warm friendship that I developed with a, a baseball player, Herman Goldberg, who was a catcher on the exhibition baseball team. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">There was no international baseball competition. </span><span class="sentence" id="366"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was practically the only place where baseball was played in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">So it was a demonstration. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">An exhibition team and he was on the team and on the Olympic team. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">Herman was, a catcher on the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">We hit it off very nicely. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">But usually uh with the athletes from the different sports, the track athletes stayed together, uh the gymnasts were together, the swimmers were together. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Not that we didn’t fraternize with each other but we had much more in common with Olympic team.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="373">QUESTION:  Now when you say you talked a lot, what did you talk about? </span><span class="sentence" id="374">What it was going to be like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> competing or?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  We didn’t talk about uh about what Europe was going to be like. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">We talked uh about mostly about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">We talked about uh, uh baseball and football and particularly about track and <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Uh we told stories, we swapped yarns. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">We were, how can I say it best, we were a bunch of guys who enjoyed each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">We had enormous respect for each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And I as one of the younger fellows on the team, looked up to some of the older men who were not only older but bigger and stronger uh that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And uh it was just a very pleasant time, a group of young men being with each other enjoying uh the sea voyage, enjoying each other’s company.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="383">QUESTION:  Did you think about the fact that you were representing the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in the Olympics?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="384">ANSWER:  It’s rather unusual uh for me or any athlete to say that uh we represented <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">I didn’t feel as though I represented the <span class="COUNTRY">USA</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Uh I represented me. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I was a, I was glad I was on the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">It was a goal I had sought. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">It was uh an achievement for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">It was an individual thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">After all the Olympic games in theory and I strongly believe this, the Olympic games are for the individual, for the excellence of the individual and theoretically though we wear national uniforms we don’t represent the different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> who’s uniforms we wear. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">We represent athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">We represent sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We compete in sports for sports’ sake. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">The competition 1s 11 12 all important. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Winning is not important. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Baron de Coubertin who founded the modern Olympic games insisted, has been quoted many times as saying, winning is not the goal of the Olympic games, taking part, participating 1s what the Olympic games are all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">So it wasn’t as though we were going there to win for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">That was the thought that was perhaps in the back of our minds. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">It was not a conscious thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">We were going as athletes, not necessarily as Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I was going there as a Jewish American athlete, but as an athlete basically. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">A Jew, an American, and an athlete.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="404">QUESTION:  What’s the reality of what you’re saying that there is that there are no, are you saying theoretically there are no <span class="DLF">national lines</span> , there are no politics in the Olympics? </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I mean that certainly isn’t my perception.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="406">ANSWER:  People say that there are politics in the Olympic games. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I say hogwash. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I say nonsense. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Where does politics fit in when you run 100 meters? </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Or 1500 meters? </span><span class="sentence" id="411">Or put the shot? </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Or even play basketball against each other? </span><span class="sentence" id="413">What politics are involved? </span><span class="sentence" id="414">The first man across the <span class="DLF">finish line</span> wins. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">No matter what the race. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">The man who puts the shot a longer distance than any other is the gold medal winner, or spins the discus, or throws the javelin or whatever the event. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">There are no politics amongst the athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">You talk about politics amongst the nations. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">But not as far as the Olympic games are concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">They don’t exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Politics are not involved in terms of winning and losing. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">That’s a good kasook right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION:  Well I just clearly nations have used those gold medals in a political framework.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">ANSWER:  I don’t believe that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I don’t believe that the uh, having uh, medal winners for a particular <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in terms of anything important, anything solid. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">After all, the East Germans were terrific as long as <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> existed and they uh sought and worked hard to get, to develop great Olympic athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And the Soviet Union won many, many medals, dominated a couple of Olympic games, and, and certainly the uh, the uh the Italians to some extent won many Olympic events as well as other Fascist countries doing well and centered their interest in the Olympic games. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And where is the Soviet Union today? </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Where are the East Germans today? </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Where is Nazi Germany today? </span><span class="sentence" id="432">They just don’t exist any more and Nazi Germany won more medals in the ’36 games than the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> did. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">33 to 26. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Although they won medals for dressage and for pistol shooting and rifle shooting and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">Uh I don’t see the importance of international athletics in terms of politics at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">They say that the governments use it, but even the successful Olympic teams like <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="REGION">East Germany</span> and the Soviet Union, where are they? </span><span class="sentence" id="437">What good did it do them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="438">QUESTION:  I don’t necessarily need to belabor this, but except for that in 1936 <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ’s successes not only in presenting the Olympics but in also winning a lot of medals, may have been an encouragement, may have spurred them on in ways at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">12 13
ANSWER:  Many people say that uh the °36 Olympic games were the Nazi Olympics or Hitler’s Olympic games. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">I saw that they were Jesse Owens Olympic games. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">The myth of Nazi Aryan supremacy was smashed to smithereens by the great non — Aryan athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Black athletes, wonderful black athletes, won the 100, the 200, the 400, the 800, the long jump, uh the high jump, medaled in many other events as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">It was the Olympic games of Jesse Owens not of Adolph Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Jesse was idolized by the German population. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">He couldn’t walk into the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> using the regular player’s <span class="DLF">entrance</span> into the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">He had to be secreted into the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">He had to use a secret <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Otherwise he’d been mobbed by the uh idolizing uh German population or whoever the spectators were and they were mostly Germans in the 120,000 seat stadium. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">It was Jesse Owens Olympics as far as I was concerned, and I think as far as the world was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And it certainly proved that uh this Aryan business of supremacy was ridiculous. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">There were non — Aryans winning the most important events.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="462">ANSWER:  Nothing happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">QUESTION:  All right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="464">ANSWER:  There was a huge crowd waiting for us at the <span class="BUILDING">Bahnhof</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , this huge <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , uh newspapermen, camera people with the newsreels, uh photographers, fans, officials of all sorts, uniforms of all sorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">Huge crowd waiting on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> when we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And as we uh got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and milled about on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> I felt a tap on my shoulder. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And I turned and saw a smallish looking young man in his mid — twenties obviously an American as soon as he talked to me, and he said to me are you Marty Glickman. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">He said you’re Jewish aren’t you. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I said yes I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">Slightly taken aback. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I said uh why do you ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">He said well I’m Jewish also. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I said you’re Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">What are you doing here. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">He said I’m going to <span class="BUILDING">med school</span> here in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I said you’re going to <span class="BUILDING">med school</span> here in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">He said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I couldn’t get into an <span class="BUILDING">American med school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So the feeling I had of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> being very much like New York in it’s anti — Semitism 13 14 or it’s lack of anti — Semitism uh was similar to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="481">It was the same sort of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , I thought, particularly as a result of this conversation with this young man going to <span class="BUILDING">med school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  What did he tell you about the political climate in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="483">ANSWER:  I asked him what it was like for you as a Jew here in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">He says well in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> I go practically unnoticed. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">Nobody knows that I’m Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Uh I’m going to <span class="BUILDING">med school</span> here. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Uh in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetels</span> , in the smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> around uh <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> uh there are problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">But now during the Olympic games and leading up to the Olympic games everything is, is, is quite. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">Uh nothing seems to be going on in terms of anti— Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And as far as my being here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I’m just like anybody else here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I’m going to <span class="BUILDING">med school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="492">QUESTION:  All of these people who greeted you at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , were they carrying swastikas, was there any of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">ANSWER:  There was a huge number of uniformed individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">I noticed and we commented about it, my teammates and I, about the fact that uh there seemed to be no men under the age of approximately 35, no young men who were not in one uniform or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">They were wearing either gray, green or brown. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">In one uniform or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">No young men in street clothes, in civilian attire, except those who were older than 35 or obviously older than uh the age that we athletes were. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Everyone seemed to be in uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">As for banners and flags, they were all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , dominated by the swastika. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">The swastika was all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">On virtually every other banner we saw there was a swastika. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">But this was ’36. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">This was before we really got to know what the swastika truly meant. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">This was two years before Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">This was three years before the outbreak of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">It was five years before the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was involved in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So the swastika and those uh German flags, the black and red and white of the German flags, did, didn’t mean very much to us except as a form of decoration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">QUESTION:  And it wasn’t sort of an unnerving amount of patriotism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  I’d never been asked about the patriotism exhibited by the Germans at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Uh it was a, a, a natural thing to see uh all these German flags. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Uh but flags of other <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> were exhibited as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Uh they rimmed the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">They were on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">There were many flags. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Mostly German. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Most of those German flags were contained the swastika. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Uh there was seemed to be no outward display of patriotism except when Hitler walked into the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">He would walk into his <span class="INT_SPACE">box</span> overlooking the <span class="DLF">field</span> and I was perhaps 50 to 75 feet away from Hitler’s box. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And he’d walk in and the <span class="BUILDING">stands</span> would rise and you’d hear it in unison. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Seig Heil. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">Seig Heil. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">All together, this huge sound reverberating through the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">That was the patriotism, the German patriotism I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Seig Heil, with a hundred and twenty thousand people shouting it, or most of the hundred and twenty thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">But that same shout of Seig Heil was matched by the sound of 14 15 Jesse Owens name. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">Every time Owens came on the <span class="DLF">track</span> and he was on frequently because he ran in four different races, and qualifying times and qualifying races for all those races. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Every time Jesse appeared on the <span class="DLF">track</span> the crowd would yell, Oo vens, Oo vens, the w in German is pronounced as av. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And they would shout with the same amount of fervor it seemed for Jesse as they sounded for Seig Heil. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Oo vens. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Oo vens. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">It was a remarkable thing to see this marvelous black athlete saluted by a hundred and twenty thousand Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  That’s a great story. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Now when Owens wasn’t coming out on the <span class="DLF">field</span> was there anything alarming about this Seig Heil in unison, a hundred and twenty thousand, or I don’t know how many people were actually shouting it, but what seemed like the entire <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">ANSWER:  Uh, I never felt as though there was anything alarming in terms of uh the Seig Heil, a feeling of fear or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">It was almost as though uh we in, in the States were singing the National Anthem or uh, uh stating uh the pledge of allegiance to our flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Uh it was uh it was fairly brief. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Hitler would walk in with an entourage of uh Goering and Goebbels and Hess and Himmler and Stryker and take their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> in this box with Hitler in the middle, slightly forward of the rest of the group, and Goering with his uh resplendent, outlandish uniforms uh wildly decorative and Goebbels the rat like face and the rest uh Hess with a very dark beard that he had. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">Uh they, they sat there. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">Uh and uh Hitler particularly was extremely nervous when German athletes ran. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">He’d sit in his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seat</span> and rub his thighs and, and, and move back and forth as I’m doing now, and uh he was obviously very much involved in the race. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And he was, I thought he was nervous for his own athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">When other athletes competed, he just sat there uh quietly and observed. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Uh he was thrilled, overjoyed, smiled when uh German athletes went to the winning podium. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">When the black athletes went to the winning podium, Hitler was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">As soon as the black athlete won his gold medal and was going to the <span class="DLF">podium</span> to receive it, the box would empty out, Hitler’s box would empty out. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">They’d all be gone and they would not pay homage to the great black athletes who were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">They stayed for the white athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">But they left for the black athletes.

QUESTION:  I want to know a little bit about what it was like being in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic village</span> , what that was like? </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Did you take little side trips into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or into other <span class="REGION">areas</span> as a tourist? </span><span class="sentence" id="551">If you can tell me a little bit about the mood before the Olympics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">ANSWER:  The event I was supposed to run, the 400 meter relay, was uh one of the last events in the track and field program. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">It came, the trials came on the penultimate day and the final day of the games for track and <span class="DLF">field</span> was the final of the 400 meter run. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">So uh [had plenty of time and so did the other athletes, except fellows 15 16 like uh Jesse Owens and uh one or two others who competed in several events, uh I had plenty of time to uh go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> during the morning hours usually or late in the afternoon after the afternoon events took place and I uh had my freedom throughout <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I could hitch a ride if I chose to, get aboard a, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trolley</span> , or whatever, because I was wearing a, an Olympic uniform and I had Olympic identification of all sorts on me, and uh it, it was, 1t was beautiful, it was lovely. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Uh I walked along uh Unter der Linden uh I thought that Unter der Linden, later I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and walked along the Champs Elysee. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I believed then that uh the Camps Elysee was not as attractive as Unter der Linden in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> but that was my own personal feeling about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic village</span> was a, a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> of <span class="BUILDING">bungalows</span> and low lying <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> which uh housed the uh various teams of the Olympic games. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Uh and it was like a <span class="BUILDING">college campus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Uh slightly rolling hills, low hills and uh dotted with uh these <span class="BUILDING">bungalows</span> and different <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">There was a <span class="DLF">practice track</span> , there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">swimming area</span> , uh an indoor natautorium, and uh we worked out at the <span class="DLF">practice track</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="562">The single most important thing I got from the games was the fact that the other athletes of the world were just like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And I was just like they. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Uh I worked out with Hungarian athletes and uh, uh Romanian athletes and British athletes, French, Japanese athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">We had many things in common. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">The things involving our sports uh and uh I’d jog alongside of the different athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">I walked alongside of them of the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> and <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> but we were with each other and we enjoyed each other’s presence even though we couldn’t communicate very well with most of the teams of the world because I didn’t speak their language and they didn’t speak mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Talked to the English, of course, and talked to those who spoke English. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Uh there was one Finn, a great Finnish athlete named Gunnar Harkert. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Uh Gunnar was uh the 5,000 meter champion. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">A young man in his early twenties who was a beautiful blond, blue — eyed, apple cheeked young man, and a great, great runner. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">He won the gold medal. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And he spoke good English. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">And we spent a great deal of time with Gunnar because he liked being with the American athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">He liked speaking English and we liked Gunnar. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And to my shock and horror, he was killed in the Russian — Finnish war just a few years after the Olympic games. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">But knowing him and knowing the other athletes, even just being with them for this limited amount of time, made me feel like one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And I think they felt like one of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">It was a wonderful education for all of us and me particularly.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="598">QUESTION:  Now Herman Goldberg your pal at the Olympics mentioned a trip into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> where I guess you hitched a ride with some German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">What happened there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">ANSWER:  One of the ways of getting from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic village</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">Olympic stadium</span> which was about eight miles distant from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic village</span> was to hitch a ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And uh Herman Goldberg, my buddy and I, hitched a ride in what amounts to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German Army jeep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And it was driven by a German sergeant who looked like a Nazi sergeant and he sat alongside of his passenger who was a, a very handsome Lieutenant in the German army, blond, blue — eyed, most attractive looking man. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">And as we got into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> , hitching the ride, they asked for our autographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And we said we’ll give it to you when we get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">Which we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Uh we took these uh eight miles at a what we thought was a reckless speed to begin with. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">We could see the speedometer going up to uh 70, 80, 90, 100. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">100 kilometers we finally realized and not a 100 miles an hour, almost uh only half the speed. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">At any rate we get to uh the <span class="BUILDING">Olympic stadium</span> and uh they, they give us some paper to sign our names and we scrawled our names, Herman Goldberg, Marty Glickman and left almost immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Uh we didn’t want them to have them ask questions about our names, Goldberg, Glickman, were we Jewish, or do we have German Jewish background or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">We were aware of the fact that we were with this German Lieutenant uh and this German sergeant who looked every inch the typical Nazi Army officer and under officer.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  We were aware of the fact that uh there was anti — Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">We were aware of the fact that these were obviously German soldiers, perhaps Nazis, but we thought all Germans uh all soldiers certainly uh were sympathetic to the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And uh we just didn’t know what Nazism was. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">This is from the prospective of two years before Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Uh the Holocaust was not only not a thought, it didn’t exist in our imagination, 1n our dreams uh we, we didn’t have nightmares about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">It was a word that I didn’t even know in 17 18 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Uh certainly had we uh any inkling of what was going to happen, we wouldn’t have been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">But uh the uh, uh the feeling about anti — Semitism for me and probably for Herman and the two other Jews who uh whom I knew uh on, on the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">There was a, a fine basketball player named Sam Bolter who was on the team and Herman and I and uh, uh there was another Jewish athlete uh, uh who. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">The Jewish athletes I knew on the team uh were Herman Goldberg, who was my buddy much of the time, and Sam Stoller who was team mate on the 400 meter relay, and Sam Bolter was a, a wonderful basketball player, a guard on the basketball team and uh the four of us were the only Jews I was aware of. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I understand now there were three other Jews who were on the uh American Olympic team, but I didn’t know them then. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I didn’t know they were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">But the, the four of them I knew, the four of us were the Jews whom I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And we certainly were not aware of what was to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I guess the whole world was not aware of, of what was to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">QUESTION:  So <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was like any other big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , but very beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was like any other big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">If I would use a single word to describe <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> during that period of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">The word would be carnival. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">There was an atmosphere of carnival about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> with the flags flying and the beautiful weather, almost every day uh it was, it was golden. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Fleecy white clouds occasionally overhead. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Late in the day, on a couple of days, there was some rain at the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">But most of the time it was just lovely. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was immaculate as I understand it still is and as I saw a couple of years when I was back there again. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And uh the people were well dressed and seemingly well fed. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Uh the beer flowed and uh it was a carnival atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">QUESTION:  Now before I get to, I want you to tell me about how you were basically dumped from the race, but I just wanted to ask you on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic village</span> , did you get to know John Woodruff at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">ANSWER:  I knew John Woodruff uh slightly from the various track meets in which we competed at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">He ran the half mile. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I was the sprinter running a 100 meters and sometimes 200 meters. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And John and I were among the younger members of the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Uh John was a, a uh a wonder athlete. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">He was taller than virtually anyone else on the, on the squad except for some basketball players, six feet four, a quiet, reserved, and a magnificent runner. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">He had the longest stride, running stride, in the world at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And he ran a marvelous race to win the gold medal at 800 meters. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">He was far better than the rest of the <span class="DLF">field</span> as you probably know and have seen, he virtually came to a halt at the half — way mark of the race, at the end of the first quarter, let the rest of the <span class="DLF">field</span> go by because he was pocketed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">He couldn’t get to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">He couldn’t make a move because there were runners in front of him and along side of him, so he let the <span class="DLF">field</span> go by him, ran around the entire <span class="DLF">field</span> and then came on to win handily down the stretch and down the backstretch first, around the far turn and around the stretch, and uh, a quiet, self — effacing, and a uh just a wonderful athlete. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">18 19
QUESTION:  Now tell me about your anticipation for your event. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I know you were training for it, and what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="654">ANSWER:  The 400 meter relay was selected beforehand and the four of us in order, Sam Stoller would start, he had the best start of the group of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I was to run the second leg down the back stretch straightway. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Floyd Draper run the third leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And Frank Wycoff run the anchor leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">He was the great veteran. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">This was his third Olympic team that he was on. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And we practiced passing the baton and passing the baton is terribly important in the 400 meter relay because the race is short and you to make a, a, a good pass, the best possible pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And we practiced this every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">In that order. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">So that we knew each other and we knew the distance we had to start running and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">The morning of the day we were supposed to run in the trial heats, we were called into a meeting, the seven sprinters were, along with Gene Cromwell, the assistant head track coach, and Lawrence Robertson, the head track coach. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And Robertson announced to the seven of us that he’s heard very strong rumors that the Germans were saving their best sprinters, hiding them, to upset the American team in the 400 meter relay. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And consequently, Sam and I were to be replaced by Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">Now there’s no question that Jesse and Ralph were faster at 100 meters than Sam and I. They’d beaten us fairly regularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And we were shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Uh Sam was completely stunned. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">He didn’t say a word in the meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I’m a brash 18 year old kid and I said coach, you can’t hide world class sprinters. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">In order to be a world class sprinter you must run in world class competition. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And we don’t know of any Germans outside of Erik Borkmaier who finished fifth in the 100 meter final beaten by Frank Wycoff, the, as well as Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">He was the best German sprinter. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Later I beat Borkamier in another post Olympic track meet, but we all knew we could beat Borkmaier, and you don’t hide world class sprinters. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I said coach there can’t be any German world class sprinters. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">He says well we’re going to take no chances, said Dean Cromwell. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And Jesse and Ralph are going to take Sam pla, Sam’s <span class="NPIP">place</span> and your <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">At which point Jesse spoke up and said coach I’ve won my three gold medals, the 100, the 200, and the long jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I’m tired. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I’ve had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Let Marty and Sam run. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">They deserve it, said Jesse. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And Cromwell pointed his finger at him and said you’ll do as you’re told. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And in those days black athletes did as they were told. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And Jesse was quiet after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">But he volunteered not to run, not to win his fourth gold medal so that Sam and I, the only two Jews on the track team, could run and win or try to win. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">The only way we could have lost that race is had we dropped the baton. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Frank Wycoff later said that uh we probably would have run just as fast because our baton passing would have been superior because we had practiced. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I spoke up, I said something else, I said coach no matter who runs we’re going to win this race by fifteen yards. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">We won by fifteen yards. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">When you see the finish of the race, all you see is Frank Wycoff crossing the <span class="DLF">finish line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">You don’t even see the next, second place finisher. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">He’s out of the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">He’s that far back. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Fifteen yards behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">The Germans didn’t finish second or third. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">They finished fourth. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">They were placed third because the Dutch team ran out of 19 20 their <span class="DLF">lane</span> and so they were disqualified. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">But they finished third in the race some fifteen, sixteen yards back. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">So the story given us was an out and out lie by Robertson and by Dean Cromwell. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">I believe now that with Hitler’s humiliation by having the black athletes stand on the winning podium the many times that they did in the 100, the 200, the 400, the 800, the long jump, the high jump. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">They were dominating the games. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">That it would have been further humiliation for Hitler to have Jews stand on the winning podium. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And as I said the only way we would not stand on the winning podium had we dropped the baton. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">We would have won the race by, by fifteen yards or more. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">So we didn’t get to run.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">QUESTION:  Now you say now this is the way you look at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Try to put yourself back to this time in the summer of 1936 as you were told that you weren’t going to be running. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">What was going through your mind? </span><span class="sentence" id="711">What were you thinking?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="712">ANSWER:  As I was told that Sam and I would not run | thought that track politics was taking place, that uh Dean Cromwell, the assistant head track coach, wanted to make sure that both his boys, Floyd Draper and Frank Wycoff were on the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And so he was making sure they were going to be on because in a trial race in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic village</span> three days before this race took place, the 400 meter race took place, we ran a trial heat. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And Stoller won the race, beating me by about oh a shoulder, a foot, and we both beat Floyd Draper by a <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">So here is Draper running the relay, whom we had both beaten just a couple of days before and Sam and I were not running. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">In the entire history of the modern Olympic games, now going into it’s 100" year, no fit American track and field performer has ever not competed in the Olympic games except for Sam Stoller and me, the only two Jews on the 1936 team. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Every other American track and field athlete has competed, so long as he was physically fit, didn’t have a pulled muscle or didn’t have an appendectomy as one of our track athletes did have and couldn’t run, a fellow named Hal Smallwood. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">But with that exception uh every athlete has run.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">But you didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I mean you weren’t thinking in those terms in August of °36. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">You were thinking it was basically favoritism again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">ANSWER:  In August of ’36 I thought originally, I did mention in that meeting I did say that coach you know we’re the only two Jews on the track team, Sam and I. There’s bound to be a furor about this back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">We’ll worry about that later said Dean Cromwell. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Later, of course, Dean Cromwell also was a member of the American First committee, that group in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> which was sympathetic to the Nazi cause. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">So my thoughts were that Cromwell was seeing to it that his boys were on that 400 meter relay. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And uh about that threat of other German sprinters that was just uh had a whole cloth. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">It, it, 1t was a complete lie.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">QUESTION:  What were you feeling? </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Here you had been preparing for this in a way for years and you’d been training especially hard, you were, I’m sure, very, very excited to participate in the Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">20 21
ANSWER:  I was fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I was 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Sam was three years older than I. He was a senior at <span class="BUILDING">Michigan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And uh in those days when you finished your college career that was usually it. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And Sam was at the end of his college career. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">He vowed never to run again because of this terrible disappointment. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">He did run and won a collegiate championship the following year. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">He did change his mind a bit later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">I as an 18 year old, just out of my freshman year, I vowed that come 1940, I’d win it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I'd win the 100, the 200, I’d uh run on the relay. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">I was going to be 22 in 1940 and I'd be at the height of my supposed uh athletic abilities in those years. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">Of course 1940 never came. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">There was a war on. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">1944 never came. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">But I was frustrated and angered enough so that I could look ahead and get even four years hence. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Young enough to get even. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">In addition I was a football player uh at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> and uh a month from the Olympic games I was going to be playing football at <span class="BUILDING">Syracuse University</span> , my first varsity season then. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And uh I had something to look forward to. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I had something to dissipate my disappointment by having a, a football season too, looming for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">QUESTION:  So you weren’t even temporarily devastated by this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">ANSWER:  I was, I was, I was not if you use the word devastated, I was not devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I was angered. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">I was frustrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And as I say I was young enough to think ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">QUESTION:  Say that again without the as I say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">ANSWER:  I was not devastated by not being on that 400 meter team. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">Terribly angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Terribly frustrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">But I was young enough to be able to look ahead to 1940 and perhaps win it all, to win the 100 and the 200. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I might be at my athletic peak when I was 22 years of age. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Here I was only 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">So I had something to shoot for, something to look forward to, come 1940 and the next Olympic games. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I also had a football season I was looking forward to because I was going into my sophomore year, first year of varsity football, and that occupied my thoughts and time and energies immediately after the games.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">QUESTION:  You mentioned that Owens stepped forward and said, let these guys run. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Did you get that kind of support from the other athletes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">ANSWER:  No one else said anything in that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> during the course of this meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">Ralph Metcalfe didn’t say a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I think he wanted to run on the relay and this justification, why, why not, if he could run on the relay. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And the only other athlete involved who didn’t run was Mac Robinson. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Mac, Jackie Robinson’s older brother, already had won the silver medal at 200 meters and he was not as good at 100 meters as he was at 200 meters. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">In addition he was not involved in the practice of passing the baton. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">That 400 meter relay was set as I say with uh leading off was Sam Stoller with that great start. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">I was running the second leg, Floyd Draper the third leg, Frank Wycoff the anchor leg and we practiced passing the baton 1n that order for two weeks in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">21 22
QUESTION:  Did the other athletes after this decision had been made, were they supportive or did they or did you guys just not talk about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">ANSWER:  They were supportive. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">The other athletes were supportive afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Uh patted me on the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Say, saying Marty you should have run. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Uh not en masse. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">Everybody was involved with his own uh achievements or striding. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Uh the, the feeling was that tough luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">But for me, as I say, it was the feeling of I'll show them. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I'll get even. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">I sat in the <span class="BUILDING">stands</span> and watched the race. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">The qualifying heats proved that we were by far the best team among the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> of the world, the best 400 meter relay team. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">The following day I was walking across the <span class="BUILDING">campus</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Olympic village</span> and I heard my name called to me, and 50 yards away was Lawrence Robertson, the head track coach, uh with his cane. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">He was an older man. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Marty, Marty. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And I jogged over to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I just want to tell you how sorry Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">I made a terrible mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And uh he said he was sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Dean Cromwell didn’t say a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Never spoke to me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Uh I don’t know what he said or thought to anyone else, but he never said a word to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Wycoff later said we would have run just as fast had you and Sam run because our superior baton passing because of practice could have enabled us to run and win.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">QUESTION:  Now you started to say you were there watching your meet. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">What was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="801">ANSWER:  Watching the trial heat and watching the final the following day were uh strange, weird, all sorts of emotions flashed through my being. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Uh frustration certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Anger certainly. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">I look out on the <span class="DLF">track</span> and I see Metcalfe passing runners down the backstretch. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">He ran the second leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And that should be me out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">As they warmed up, jogging up and down the <span class="DLF">track</span> , I, that should be me. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">That, that’s me out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And you know frustrated at it uh feeling uh also feeling relief that I wasn’t running in this race. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I didn’t have the pressure of receiving the baton, running with it and passing the baton. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">I wasn’t fearful of dropping the baton. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And all relay runners have that uncertainty, that fear of the possibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">I’ve never dropped a baton in the many relay races I’ve run, but I’ve seen it dropped. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">So I it was some feeling of relief, but mostly it was anger and frustration and the feeling that should be me out there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">QUESTION:  Who were you sitting with during the event?</span></p>

QUESTION:  When we stopped you were describing what it was like being in the <span class="BUILDING">Olympic stadium</span> , the pageantry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="886">ANSWER:  The opening day parade. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">One of the things I, I best remember about the uh, uh the opening day ceremonies of the Olympic games was standing in the <span class="DLF">infield</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> while the Olympic oath was being taken and uh the various music was being played, was the release of these thousands of pigeons which had been cooped up and they were all, alongside the inner perimeter of the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And now after being in these <span class="DLF">cages</span> for I don’t know how many hours or how many days, they were suddenly released and they flew up over the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> and circled round and round. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And we began to hear on our straw hats that was part of our uniform, the straw hats, splat, splat, splat from these pigeons. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And we were afraid 24 25 to look up of course or else we’d get it in the eye. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">But there we were cringing in the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> and the splat, splat of all these thousands of pigeons going round and round and finally they went far enough up to get out of the <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> and flew away. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">It was a very funny moment.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="902">QUESTION:  This was something that you realized later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="903">ANSWER:  I was, I was more aware of it later than Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">I was more aware of it later uh than I was at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">But uh Brundage was a most important figure. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">Head of the American Olympic Committee and later on the president of the International Olympic Committee.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="907">QUESTION:  You mentioned you had wanted, or were thinking forward to the 1940 Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">So apparently this experience didn’t sour you at all on sports, or fairness, Olympics. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">A; My experience in the Olympic games and the fact that I didn’t run didn’t sour me on the games at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">It soured me on Avery Brundage. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">It certainly soured me on anti — Semitism and the Nazis as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">But as far as the Olympic games then and for many years thereafter, I was an Olympic uh booster. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I didn’t want us to boycott the games in the <span class="COUNTRY">Soviet Union</span> in 1980. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">I didn’t want the Soviet Union to boycott the American games in 1984. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">But I’m not very happy with the current Olympic games. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">The Olympic games of ’96 and the enormous commercialization of the Olympic games. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I think that the Olympic ideal, the Olympic creed, doesn’t exist any longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">It’s all strictly professionalism. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I think that the current Olympic games in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Atlanta</span> is a huge project for profit and that’s about all.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I became aware of what took place in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1938, Kristallnacht was the beginning of the knowledge generally of what took place in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">In 1936 even the German Jews stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> until 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Many left but far more remained in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> until ’38 and then they started to try to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Of course, I didn’t know about uh the Holocaust until after the war was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I was a, a marine in the, in the <span class="REGION">central Pacific</span> during World War II on the <span class="REGION">Marshall Islands</span> and uh the European campaign was that far distant from our involvement in the Pacific. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">So it wasn’t until I came back in December of ’45 that I began to realize, began to hear and know of what took place in the years, the closing years of World War IT
QUESTION:  Did you rethink at all about your participation in 1936/ I mean when you started learning much more, did it make you think about it all in context?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="927">ANSWER:  I’ve been asked many times whether I have second guesses about going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1936 and uh I persist in saying that I’m delighted I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Uh I’m glad that the games took place in 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">UhI saw no harm from the games themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I saw a great deal of good from the games. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">For me as an individual learning about the other athletes of the world and for the great success of the non — Aryan athletes, the marvelous black athletes who had this great success in helping smash that myth of Aryan supremacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">I think that was a very positive thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="933">QUESTION:  Did you afterwards think more about being a Jewish athlete? </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I mean did it, because in fact that seems to be what happened in 1936 even though prior to that you never considered yourself a Jewish athlete. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">You were one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="936">ANSWER:  Something took place in 1937 which uh was a direct result of what happened to me in 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">I was playing football at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> and uh for this particular I was the star of the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">We had upset Cornell the week before and uh I had uh scored both touchdowns for Syracuse against Cornell 14 to 6 was the final score. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">And I’d had the best day I ever had on the <span class="DLF">football field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Lot of publicity about me then. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And uh I’m embarrassed almost to say it, I was the star of the team going to a game against Maryland, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And as we’re getting dressed for the game sitting alongside of me is the other starting half — back. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">His name is Wilmoth Sedette Sing. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">He is a black man but his mother married a Hindu physician and Will and I played side by side. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">We’re in the same class. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">We took classes together. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">He helped me through my physics class, my physics course. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">Later he was a member of the uh the black airmen, the black squadron who helped form uh the one squadron of black aviators in World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">But this was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> , <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="950">We’re being dressed for the game. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">He’s sitting right alongside of me, right here. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">He slept alongside of me where we slept in the, in the <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> during the football season. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">And the coach came in, Ossie Solom along with the Director of Athletics Lou Andreas and he said uh fellows I’ve got some news. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Uh the local press and <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> had just found out that Will is not a Hindu but 26 27 he’s a black man and consequently he won’t play today. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And I said to myself sitting there, stand up Marty and say if Will doesn’t play, I don’t play. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">And I’m one of the leaders of the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">I’m the star of the team, this week anyhow because of that previous game the week before. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">And I say stand up and say that. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And I think to myself, but if I do stand up and say that and the game is cancelled and there’s ruckus or this furor develops as a result of the game being cancelled, if that happens they’II point to me and there’s that Jewish guy getting in trouble again. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Because just the year before I’d been involved in the anti — Semitic incident in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And so I didn’t say a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And Will didn’t play. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">And I played. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And we got beat. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">We got beat twelve nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">A couple of years after that, Will was killed in World War II and to this day I still feel very strongly about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">That I should have gotten up and said and he was good enough to die for our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but he wasn’t good enough to play against Maryland.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="968">QUESTION:  I want to ask you one more question. (</span><span class="sentence" id="969">Straighten jacket and tie0
ANSWER:  After the Olympic games uh many of the track and field athletes toured Europe and several different track meets. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I ran on a 400 yard relay team in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> at <span class="BUILDING">White City Stadium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I ran with Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe and Frank Wycoff and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">We set a world’s record at 400 yards. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">That world’s record still stands. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Mostly because they rarely run that race and they don’t run <span class="DLF">yards</span> any more they now run meters. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">So um the four of us are still world record holders at the 400 yard relay. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">I also ran in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> after the uh Olympic games. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Ran against Frank Wycoff and uh I won the race against Wycoff that day and uh a combination of uh Japanese and French athletes as well as American athletes competed that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And I won that race. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Also ran in <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="980"><span class="COUNTRY">Iran</span> ina handicap race and uh didn’t win that handicap race. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">Uh I was set back so far from the rest of the <span class="DLF">field</span> because these were local athletes in uh in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Edinburgh</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> , that uh I was literally off the <span class="DLF">track</span> , uh that far back, and had to run up a slight incline to get to the <span class="DLF">track</span> and then start running. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">I finished out of the money.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="983">QUESTION:  So I think what you’re telling me from those first few races is that you probably were good enough to run in the Olympics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="984">ANSWER:  Well, I, I was on the team.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="985">QUESTION:  But to have actually competed instead of all that stuff you were...

<p><span class="sentence" id="986">QUESTION:  Sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">All of a sudden a few weeks after the Olympics, you’re making a world record in the same event.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="988">ANSWER:  I don’t want to brag. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I mean it’s been said. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">I, I was on the team. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">That’s the important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">I made the team and the obviously I was good enough to be uh to run in the Olympic games because I was on the American team. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And uh 27 28 American athletes compete in the Olympic games when they make the Olympic team, except for these two Jewish athletes who didn’t because of Avery Brundage and Adolph Hitler and anti — Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And I’d like to add one other thing that sometimes people feel sorry for me and what happened to me in, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , in 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">What happened to me was as nothing, absolutely zero to that which took place later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">There’s just no feeling of uh comparison and no feeling of, of hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">Uh there’s still feeling of anger, but uh I was there and uh that mattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">What took place was much, much more important afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="999">QUESTION:  I think I have one more question. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">You mentioned this race in <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1001">ANSWER:  The football game in <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1002">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">I’m sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">The football game. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And the fact that you were very conflicted about standing up for this black Indian athlete. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">Have you thought about ways in which your experience from the 1936 Olympics impacted you or shaped you in terms of values or choices you made afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">I know it’s a fairly broad question, but.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1008">ANSWER:  I think my experience in 1936, my experience in athletics generally specifically in °36 made me aware of the fact that I am not different than other people of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I am not different than blacks or browns or yellows or whites. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">That we’re all one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And uh I think I’ve learned not to be tolerant necessarily because tolerance I think implies sort of a uh a superiority over individuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">But I’ve learned to appreciate other people I think because of my experience in ’36 and my experience in athletics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1013">QUESTION:  Did it make you more vigilant toward racism, anti — Semitism, discrimination?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1014">ANSWER:  I think the experience of all athletes makes me more conscious of other people, of bias and prejudice against uh Black and Asiatics and Latins and Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">I think that we're people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">I’ve learned that through sports. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">I think that at every level of sports from my days as a schoolboy to my days as a broadcaster has enabled me to thoroughly enjoy and appreciate the abilities of the great athletes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">I was able to look at and broadcast about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">The Jim Browns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">The wonderful Black athletes, the wonderful Japanese athletes, uh the great athletes of the world uh regardless of what their background was.</span></p>
