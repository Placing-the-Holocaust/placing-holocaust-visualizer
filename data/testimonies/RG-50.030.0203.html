<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Good morning, Charlene.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Good morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Tell me your name and when you were born, including your maiden name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My name is Charlene Perlmutter Schiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I was born December 16, 1929, in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My first years, my early childhood years, were very happy years. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My family consisted of two wonderful parents and an older sister, Tchtya. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">My sister was four years older than I. We lived in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Both my parents were educators and civic leaders of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My father was a professor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">State University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">He taught philosophy. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">He was a very educated man. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He had several doctorates from different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Sorbonne</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Basel</span> and I'm not sure, one <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I don't know if it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was a happy <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">It was usually filled with many people, people from all walks of life congregated there. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I remember meetings, I remember recitals, poetry readings, all sorts -- book reviews, all sorts of cultural activities took place in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And, the important thing I would like to stress is, my parents were leaders, not only in the Jewish community, but in the community at large. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> hosted the Starosta, which 1s, I guess, like a mayor here; the clergy, the Kshondz, the Polish Kshondz, the Ukrainian Batiushka, as well as the Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I had a lot of fun when I was a very young child. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">We were tutored from the time we were four years of age. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">We had private tutors. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">My father believed that education was one of the most important things in life, and he stressed that, and we had to obey his orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">The <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was a loving <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but there was a lot of discipline. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">At dinner time, I remember we would not speak until spoken to. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">My father had to speak first. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I don't know, it seems that where we lived it was the main <span class="DLF">street</span> of our little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , 1t was Ulica Mitzkievitcha 57, and I remember the <span class="DLF">street</span> was lined with old chestnut trees all along the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> , and it was a wide <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , was on a terraced piece of property. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">There were beautiful <span class="DLF">English gardens</span> in front, and there was like an <span class="DLF">orchard</span> in the back, and the entire <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was surrounded by a <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and there were steps going up to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">That's the way I remembered it, and that's the way I like to remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Unfortunately, it wasn't like that when I went back after the war to see the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Coming back to my childhood, I remember that all during my very early childhood there was talk about our going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , immigrating to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , we called it <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And, I remember on my fourth birthday I was walking with my father on the banks of our <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and I asked him, "Papa, is that <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And, he explained to me that was not so. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He tried to show me maps, but that was a little bit beyond my scope of understanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">He also tried to teach me many things, and I remember he explained what air is that we breathe, and, again, that was a little bit too much for me, but we had a wonderful relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">My mother was a very loving mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">She was on the go most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I know that she was a teacher, but I do not remember her teaching, working as a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">She worked in different areas of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community,</span> and I distinctly remember that every summer she organized, she and other ladies, but she was usually the chairman of it, she organized camps for the poor children, and these were <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camps</span> for all the poor children in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">It was not just a camp for the Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Meetings were going on and the congregation kept coming, I mean, they used to congregate in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> continually. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Now and then, there were meetings where my father would close the <span class="DLF">door</span> to his <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , and these meetings I was not allowed to interrupt. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I did not realize what this all was about until after the war, but these were meetings with young people who my father helped escape illegally out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  What was your name, your first name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  My nickname was Musia. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">It's a derivative, Polish, Jewish, what have you, but my given name was Shulamit, here we pronounce it Shulamit, it's a Hebrew name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Can you talk about your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  My sister was a very artistic person. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">She was four years older than I, and I know I was the bane of her existence, because I always tried to go and do whatever she did, and I bothered her friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">She played the violin beautifully, and she also played the piano. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">I was given some lessons, but, I was not artistic at all, and they finally gave up on me with these lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">She continued, and she sometimes, you know, played the piano during the recitals in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , or she played the violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I remember one incident, it's rather funny now, it wasn't at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I was angry with her, I was mad at her for some reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I don't recall why. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">But, I got hold of some paint and I painted all the keys on our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> so that she wouldn't be able to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I was punished for that severely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  How?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  I was sent to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and I wasn't allowed to come out for the entire afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">That was a lot of -- that was a big punishment for me, because I was a free spirit, and I was sort of a tomboy, and I liked to be around, you know, <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and play with children, climb <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , and do all these sorts of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I never painted the keyboard again. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">It took a long time to clean it up, and I think it cost a lot of money, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So, that was a mean deed that I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But I loved my sister, I adored her, and she was wonderful with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">She was very patient, but I did not understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I felt very secure in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I had so much love and so much caring that in retrospect I feel that gave me the basis, the strength, to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I thought about it a lot, and I think that's probably why I did -- one of the reasons I survived, I was able to survive, 1s because I had so much love, and security and caring in my very early childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Can you talk a little bit more about your father and these walks that you took? </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Was this a regular --
ANSWER:  Yes, and, I mean, the way it was arranged, my father traveled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , and now and then he would allow my sister or me to go with him to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , but we never went together. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">These were times, private times, for my father and me, or for my father and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And, he, I guess now when I realize, he spoke to us a little bit on a higher level than we were able to -- than I was able to understand, but it was always very uplifting for me to be with my father one on one, just to have him to myself, and he would tell me stories, all sorts of stories, and he always tried, I don't know, it's almost -- it's scary to say this, but it's almost as if he knew that our time would not be long enough, and he tried to give me as much as he could of the knowledge that I could absorb.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  Before we go on, could we show the picture for a second of your parents and your sister, please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Of course, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">This is my father here. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">This is a picture that my husband and I had worked on and finally -- I mean, it came to fruition in <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">I had nothing left when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but some of my family had different pictures, and this 1s a composite of three different pictures, but these were the closest to what I remember my parents and my sister, that's the way they look, and that's the way I have them etched in my memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">They were very loving, giving people, and I'm sure I idealize them now, perhaps, a little too much, but that's the way I remember them. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">I cannot tell you one flaw in these three very perfect people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  Did you spend time with your mother alone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes, we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Where or how?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  We would go, there was a great big <span class="DLF">park</span> on the -- well, it wasn't quite in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but there was a <span class="DLF">park</span> , and this <span class="DLF">park</span> , I mean, was with <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , you know, and flowers, and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shrubs</span> , and this is where people used to go when they wanted to take a walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And on the edge of that <span class="DLF">park</span> there lived the landlord of the -- the rich landlord of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , she owned a lot of property. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">She was a very old, old lady, and I remember she always wore black. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">She was an old lady, she was a widow, and all she had around was just servants to help her. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">But, the <span class="DLF">park</span> was on the edge of her <span class="REGION">estate</span> , and that's where I would take walks with my mother, just she and I. We would go sometimes, the whole family, too, but our time one on one was very important to my parents, and they did give us time one on one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  Do you remember any conversations you had with your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">With my mother, I mostly discussed my friends, what she was doing, the things that she loved so much, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that she arranged for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I know she traveled quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">She was gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rovno</span> and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovel</span> , and there she had meetings with other ladies who were also arranging for different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camps</span> for children, and she would tell me about the meetings, and I would ask, you know, what she would bring me, you know, little surprises. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Wherever my parents went, they always had to bring us a surprise, whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">It didn't matter what it was, but we loved to have surprises, presents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">QUESTION:  Who took care of you when your mother went away? </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Was your father at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">There was a young woman who would come in and stay with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">No, not my father, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">He never did dishes, and he never did anything in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> whatsoever, you know, as far as helping out, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My father had a very wonderful <span class="BUILDING">library</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102">His <span class="BUILDING">private library</span> was his first love after his family I think, and teaching, and he collected rare books. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">His books, I mean some of them were first editions, and all sorts of rare precious books. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And, people in the entire <span class="REGION">area</span> knew that he collected these books, so when they found a rare book they would come to him and he would pay through the nose to get these books. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And often he would go into his <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and read, or bring out a book for us to enjoy, but we always knew we had to wash our hands, and we were not allowed to touch these books without his permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">It was a very wonderful <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , perhaps, nowadays it might seem too strict for the way we live here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but we didn't know any different. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I mean, we accepted it, we loved it, and we gained an awful lot from that kind of upbringing, I believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  And, both you and your sister were part of what was going on in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> most of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  So, you were not considered just little children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Well, I was a pain in the neck always, and I was into everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I remember one time during Passover, there was a -- for the first Seder, which 1s a festive occasion, our parents gave my sister and me gold lockets with the Star of David to wear on our necks, and I promptly lost mine, and no one could sit down at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> until we found that locket, because that's what I wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And, I was a little spoiled I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We did find the locket, I mean the Star of David and the chain, and I did not remember that occurrence until we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in 1985 and one of my father's former students reminded me, because he was one of the guests at that dinner.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">QUESTION:  Did you have your own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I shared it with my sister, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  Did you have your own little <span class="BUILDING">library</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, I did, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We started collecting, I think I knew how to read when I was four, because we -- it was stressed, and it was part of our make up, that as soon as you knew how to speak, and walk, and talk, you had to start acquiring knowledge. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">My father was almost fixed on that, I mean it was a fixation with him, and he kept saying that knowledge and education no one can take away from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And, again, in retrospect, I didn't realize it, but now I realize that the education that my father acquired was all done out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , the reason being, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> there were quotas, so he had to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to acquire his education and to him it was priceless and he tried to, I mean, I guess, give it to us, the feeling that education is very important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  You described yourself as a tomboy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Not a student?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  Not a student, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  What do you mean by being a tomboy, what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  I liked to just, you know, loaf around, play, climb <span class="DLF">fences</span> , and I always had a little penknife with me, which came in very handy later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I don't think I played with dolls much. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I think I had one doll, that's about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I bought a big, beautiful doll when we went back to Europe in 1988 to make up for it, but I think I wasn't into frilly dresses, I was not very feminine I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Maybe that's why.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  How did you come by this pen- knife? </span><span class="sentence" id="134">That seems unusual.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I just liked to have a penknife with me, and I asked for it, and my father and mother debated, I guess, but they finally gave it to me when I was about 5-1/2 or six years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I had to show it every day when I'd come back, you know, from playing, that I knew how to use it, yes, and ever since, it's almost, I have a penknife with me now. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">I never go anyplace without a little knife.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  And, what did you do with it at five?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  Oh, I would get some, you know, willow, pussy willow branches and carve things and cut up things, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  You had a dream, a recurring dream.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  Yes, I had a recurring dream, and it was more than twice or three times, I don't know how many times, but I dreamt that I was left in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> all by myself, and I remember when I woke up from that first dream I ran into my parents' <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and I cried, and they tried to, you know, appease me, and tried to explain that it's only a nightmare, it's a dream, and it doesn't mean anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And, when it happened several times, they just dismissed it in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">It's almost scary, because this is exactly as if a prophecy, because it did happen later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Were you hearing things about what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> even as a five and six year old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  I guess I was hearing, but it was sort of -- I did not realize what it was all about, but politics was part of every meeting, of every discussion, of every dinner, of every gathering in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But, I sust didn't want to have anything to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">It was scary, and maybe that's why, but I just did not pay much attention to it, but 1t was discussed continually, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And from the time I remember walking, all I remember in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was a conversation about going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I knew my father had family there, and my grandmother was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and I remembered her address, 231 Echo Place, Bronx 57, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I don't know if they had ZIPs at that point, but that's what I remembered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Who was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> from your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  My father had five sisters and his mother, and they all ended up in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and he was the last one, supposedly, to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">He was somewhere chronologically in the middle, but I'm not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">At this point, I only have one aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbus</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> , my father's sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  Do you remember prejudice, or anti-semitism when you were growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  Strangely enough, I do not. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">My friends were Jewish young people, and Polish girlfriends, and Ukrainian, and we all played together. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We all had wonderful times. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">We were in each other's <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="161">No, I must say honestly, I do not remember any anti-semitism before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Again, maybe I wasn't perceptive enough, but I did not see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I had a good time, I played, and we were -- the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was open for everyone, I was welcome in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , and they were welcome in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I did not see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Obviously, there was anti-semitism, but I was not aware of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">QUESTION:  You and your sister were in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  And, she was four years older.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">QUESTION:  And, you were the bane of her existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  Yes, I was, and I feel badly, I feel very guilty about it now, but I was very curious, and she was very artistically inclined. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">She practiced a lot, you know, on her musical instruments, she played the piano, and maybe I was a little bit -- maybe that was sibling rivalry, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">She was such a young lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">She was beautiful, and she did everything right, and I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And, I know my parents loved us both equally, but I guess maybe I tried to steal away a little bit of attention from her, and that was my way of doing it, just to disturb her and to show her that I'm there too, you know, because otherwise I was insignificant. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And, I wanted to be grown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">She was so grown up, and I was not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  Did you play together at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  I don't recall that we really played together, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">She would correct me when I would practice the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> and would tell me, you know, how awful I sounded, you know, and I knew I wasn't good, and I wasn't -- I really wasn't interested in playing, and I was not interested in being good. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">I guess I wanted to be good, but I didn't want to work at it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  Did you have a best friend?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I had several best friends, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I would rather not give their names for several reasons, but I did have several best friends, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  Girls? </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Boys?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">ANSWER:  Girls, and they -- no, there were two boys, too, but the girls, one of them had a very sad ending in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and that was very difficult for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">All the others died, I mean were murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">The one Ukrainian girl, when I came back, her name was Marusia Czajkowska, and I asked about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">She was about a year older than I, and she died, we were back in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> in 1988 in August, I was told she died in May of 1988, and that I was very saddened by that. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We have not kept in touch at all, but she was one of my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Were your parents religious?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  That's a very difficult question to answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">When you -- they were traditional, they observed the holidays, all the, I guess, things that make one, you know, be considered a Jew, but we didn't go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> every Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">We were not kosher in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I don't know how to answer that. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So, they were and they weren't. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They were, I'd call them, emancipated, or they were not assimilated per se, you know, because we all were very proud of who we were, who we are, but there was not such a stress on the observance of prayer and things like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">QUESTION:  Tell me what happened in 1939, at least as far as you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  In 1939 when the war broke out, September 1, the Russians -- the Soviet -- I mean at that point, now I know that Hitler and Stalin had an agreement. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">They divided <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in half. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We lived in the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and, consequently, the Soviet Union took over our part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I remember it happened maybe two or three days after the actual war started, and I remember long <span class="DLF">lines</span> of people, these were the refugees who were trying to escape from the German part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they would -- I mean, there were people with bundles, children, and I mean it was a very sad picture, and that's what is in my mind, of all these people walking on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , not even on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> because there were so many of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And then, when they stopped, that's when the Russians came in, and there they were the soldiers and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">People greeted them with flowers, very happy, and it was sort of exciting for me, not realizing what was happening, but there was no blood shed in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , you could hear the sound, I guess, of guns and all in the background, but for a very short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">They came in, and as far as I know, nothing really changed for us with one exception, the official language became Russian instead of Polish, because -- and that was no problem, because most Europeans are bi- or tri-lingual because of necessity, our neighbors all around us were speaking a different language, so that was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And, my father still had his job. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I mean, he kept his position at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I'm sure there were some very drastic changes, but I did not realize them. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Some of the people who had businesses in <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , I guess, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , they are the ones who probably felt the change more drastically than I did, because most of the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , or all, became nationalized. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And, at first we had much of everything, and then all of a sudden things started to -- there were shortages of bread, milk, clothing, but that was not my problem, that was my parents' problems, and I did not sense any perceptible change in anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">The Russian language came after a little while, it wasn't difficult, and they did not single out one particular group of people, but I guess they did, only I didn't realize it, they singled out the people who were materialistically rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And, now and then, I understand, there were people who all of a sudden would disappear at night and we wouldn't know, you know, what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">These were the people that were, I guess, driven out to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">These were the -- they called them the <span class="BUILDING">Kulacks</span> , the rich people, but we were not materialistically rich, and my father was an intellectual, and he was left alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">I know one thing, that going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was a little more difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">My father paid more attention not to be so visible in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> as he was before, and I'm sure that was because of the Soviet occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Other than that, I really did not see many changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Again, we still had meetings, the people congregated in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">There were some disappearances. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">The Polish Kshondz, the Polish priest, wasn't there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">There were still the big beautiful Kosciol, that's the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Polish church</span> , which was right in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> , and it was a magnificent <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">It looked almost like a <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> , and, again, there were old chestnut trees all around that <span class="BUILDING">Kosciol</span> , and across the <span class="DLF">street</span> there was a beautiful statue of Swienta Matka Boska, and that means Saint Mary, the mother of Jesus, it was a beautiful statue, and it was always surrounded with flowers, even in the winter time. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And, that sort of got neglected when the Russians came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ukrainian Tzerkev</span> , that's their <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , was very close to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and that was also a magnificent <span class="BUILDING">building</span> with the onion-shaped domes in gold, and I noticed that there were not as many people attending as they did before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">QUESTION:  And you noticed that then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">ANSWER:  Yes, but I didn't question it at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Were you frightened during this period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  No, no, I was not frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">In the beginning, it was sort of exciting, you know, all these changes, I was not frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">We were, I sensed that my parents were very disappointed, because, apparently, our papers were almost ready for our immigration to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> I remember, I'm not quite sure, but I think it was in 1938, that we all traveled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> for interviews, and I guess we went to the <span class="BUILDING">Consulate</span> , you know, getting ready to immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but, of course, the war interrupted all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">And, I sensed that my parents were disappointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I know one thing that happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">In 1939, I think it was 1939, there was the World's Fair in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and my father was offered two tickets, he received two invitations through the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> to attend the World's Fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">My father asked for four tickets, and, of course, they didn't give him the four tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So, that's 1ronic and very sad for me now. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">I remember taking only one trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , during that occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I mean, during the Russian occupation, only one time, and there was a speaker, and I mean, of course, it was all in Russian, you know, and I didn't have as good a time as I used to at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION:  Do you remember why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER:  No, I don't know why, but I did not have as good a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  Your father didn't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> anymore?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  No, that was another thing that, again, I mean these things come out only when people question me, because I don't, you know, realize how important it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">He used to be a visiting professor at the <span class="BUILDING">Jagelonski University</span> , which is a famous old <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">And, when the Russians became our -- when they occupied our part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , my father's visits or trips to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> stopped, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  Was your mother working during this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  No, she was not working, no, I mean working for pay, no, she was not, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">So, I mean, we didn't have money problems, but we didn't live a very -- we lived a comfortable life. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I didn't know any better. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">We used to get shoes twice a year, in the summer and winter, that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And, I mean, you know, everything was just regimented and very -- not frugal, but my mother -- my parents were very careful with the money because there wasn't that much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">We lived comfortably, and I wasn't lacking in anything, and it was a wonderful life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  When the Russians were occupying, your sister was a teenager at this time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  Were there boyfriends? </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Were there -- do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  No, there were no boyfriends per se, but there were boys who would come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but there was no dating. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Everybody went in groups, and that's when I started going on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I was old enough, I think, I guess, what was I, eight or something --
QUESTION:  '41?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">ANSWER:  -- no, '41, that's '39 to '41, nine, ten, at that point I already had my own friends and I didn't bother my sister too much, she was far too old for me at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">But, no, there was no dating, but there were activities at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we used to observe Imieniny. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Imieniny is like a birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">It's actually, it means giving a name, and they had Imieniny every week it seems like one of her group, you know, had a party, and at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there were parties, and there was a very active social life, and there were lots of activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">She had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , my sister, and that was rather -- that was a luxury. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I never learned how to ride a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and I did not have one of my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">I was supposedly to have gotten her's later on, but it never came to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And, we used to go on Wycieczki, and that's like trips, I mean, just go to the <span class="DLF">park</span> , you know, picnics, and from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , these were organized things, organized activities, and then we did it also on our own, and there were many sports events. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I don't know, it wasn't football, I think it was soccer, and there was, I want to say softball, it's not softball, with a net, what do you call it, volleyball, yes, volleyball. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">There were all sorts of activities and, I mean, games that we used to play, and in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I remember, there was a huge <span class="DLF">school yard</span> , and we would go out for there for hours for our physical education, there was physical education from the time you were in <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , and it's organized, you know, and I mean we used to play all sorts of games and these were very entertaining and very fulfilling. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">We used to run, have games of running, and walking, singing, and it was a lot of fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And, I guess when the Russians came in they just took over the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and all, but they continued with the same activities. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">There was one thing that I would like to bring out, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I wanted very much to become a Brownie, and Jews were not permitted to be in the scouting movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">That was - when I say there was no anti-semitism, that is the one sign, I didn't realize why, but Jewish boys and girls were not allowed to become Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, and I missed that because of the physical -- I mean, they had so many physical games, you know, and they did their activities, they were very fulfilling to me, very appealing to me, and I could not participate in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I know I'm jumping from one <span class="NPIP">thing</span> to another.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">QUESTION:  When did life change drastically, 1941?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="278">ANSWER:  In 1941, early summer, life took a turn for the worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Apparently, my parents did hear, and the whole community, they heard what was going on in the German part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but I don't know, but it seems, of course, I didn't know then, but it seems no one could believe the atrocities that took place, and so, we just went on with life as it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">In 1941, in the summer, all of a sudden we heard bombs and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> flying overhead, and after a few days the Germans marched in very much like the Russians did a few years before, and, again, I mean, there was no bloodshed as far as I can recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">They came in with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="282">They came in, the soldiers looked much -- they were much better dressed, and they came in and people again greeted them with flowers, and they were very welcome in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="283">A lot of people were very happy that the Germans came in, and that the Russians were leaving. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">If there were fights, they were outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so, really, there was very little fighting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">But in 1941, early summer, was when the world became completely topsy-turvy for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">When the Germans came in, from the very beginning, they concentrated and they let it be known that the Jews are the ones that they are going to try to murder, all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">What they did, I don't recall if it was the first or second day after they came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span> , they went around with a list and they looked for people by name. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">These were people who were leaders, the Jewish leaders, and my beloved father was among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">They came into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , they burst in, and they asked for him, and my father saw them, he tried to get out the back way. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">They caught him, and they led him away. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">He never even said goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">I'll never forget that look in his eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And, this way, they took away about 300 of the Jewish leaders. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">The next day, it seems every day from then on there were decrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">At first, it was for the Jews, we always had to congregate in the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> , that's the central place. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And, each day there were new decrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">First, we had to bring all the gold, all the silver, all the radios, all the furs, all the rugs, the Persian rugs, everything that was of any value, we had to bring to the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> to give to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">It was an organized thing, and everyone, there was so much chaos, and so much panic, that it's almost like people were going in a trance. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">All of a sudden, most of the heads of the families were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">We didn't know where, when, or if we'll ever see our fathers and brothers again. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I know now that when they took my father away, my mother was still a very young woman and she turned gray overnight, but she tried very much to camouflage her feelings, and she did not want us to feel the despair that she probably felt, and everyone else there, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">We were gathered every day for different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">First, I mean, we had to part with all our dearest possessions. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Then, they gathered us in the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> and we had to watch when they burned the main <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and the little -- there were little, they call them schtiebels, they were separate <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">They burned all our Torahs. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">They burned all the books of prayer, and we had to stand and watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Everyone who was over 14 years of age was sent to slave labor, and that was right from the beginning after they, you know, ordered us to bring all the things to the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">My mother and my sister ended up working. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">My mother was digging <span class="DLF">ditches</span> , and so was my sister, and they marched them, they met at the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> in the early morning and they were marched back at night, and sometimes both my sister and my mother were black and blue from beatings, from, you know, awful treatment that they endured during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">This lasted about two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I'm not quite sure of the exact time, but then one day people were told not to go to work, and we were given approximately an hour to take whatever we could carry with us, and we had to congregate again at the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="312">There, we were told we are going to move, we are going to live in a new <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and this was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">They marched us into one of the poorest sections of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and we were assigned a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  Can we stop for a moment? </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Let's go back to these two weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">QUESTION:  When your father was taken away, was everyone in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , your mother, and sister and you, did you all --
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  -- you were all there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, we were all there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  Do you remember what happened after he -- do you remember his face?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">QUESTION:  What happened to you when he left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="323">ANSWER:  His face was very sad and there were tears in his eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">He tried to put on a jacket, a coat jacket, and they wouldn't allow him, so he went in his shirt sleeves. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">It was almost a bewildered look, but he turned his head, and they held him on each <span class="NPIP">side</span> , there was a Ukrainian, there were Germans, but the Ukrainians were the ones who grabbed him, and these were people, I'm sure, that he knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">I don't know who they were, but my mother said she knew who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And, there was a look, I can't describe it, but it was great sadness, and bewilderment, and love. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It was a mix of many feelings in that one last look. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And, my mother gathered my sister and me, we just looked and we started crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And, that's the way they took him away. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">They took him out the back, the <span class="DLF">kitchen door</span> , not in the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">It was a very poignant, very sad moment in our lives, but I don't know, but my mother, whatever she felt, she didn't show. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">She right away tried to tell us how wonderful it will be when we are all together again, from the very first. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And, the next morning she got up, she was gray, completely gray. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">This lasted, again, all these horrible things, lasted for about two weeks, and then when we were herded into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> life took a new turn for the worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">My mother and my sister were still marched to work every morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">The people, like myself, under 14 and very old, were left to ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was completely enclosed by a high <span class="DLF">fence</span> that was reinforced with barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">There were two <span class="DLF">gates</span> , one in the back, I mean, one in the front and one in the back, and one could not enter or leave without a written pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">We had to wear the Star of David on the front of our clothing and on the back, for some reason it had to be yellow in color. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Everything was very regimented. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">The Germans appointed a Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">The Judenrat was a group of men who were sort of in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and anything and everything that the Germans wanted from the Jews they went through the Judenrat, because it was beneath them to go to an ordinary Jew to request things, so they did it all through the Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">This is also a very sad occurrence, because here our brothers, our own kind, who are requested, "I need 200 people," you know, and they have to make the selection who these 200 people will be to deliver to the Germans, and at that point we didn't know what was going to happen to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Every now and then in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there were, they called them Lapanka, and these were round-ups again. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">The Germans would drive by with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> or a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and they would grab people randomly, and I mean it didn't matter 1f you were a worker, or if you were an old person, or a child, and these people would never be heard from again. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And, sometimes during when people were working, during work, and consequently that made it very, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Every morning when I would get up and I would say goodbye to my sister and my mother, I never really knew whether or not they would return to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that evening, because they could have had a Lapanka at work. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I forgot to tell you, about my father's <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , and this was before we were gathered into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">One day, that was during the two weeks of our sort of being still neither here nor there, one day a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> pulled up in front of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and several Germans came out, very well dressed, and they knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and came in, and demanded to know where my father's <span class="BUILDING">library</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And, my mother showed them, that was after my father was already gone, and they came in and meticulously took every single, precious book with them, and they even gave my mother a receipt for these books. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">And, that was one time when they addressed her as "Gnadige Frau’, at that point she was a lady, not a Jew, because she had all these precious books that they appropriated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  They took something else, didn't they?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">My father was given a gift from some of his students. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">It was, I guess, a relief map, you call it, it was built from plywood and it had every continent, every panel had a different continent, all the continents of the world, and that was in his study, that was not in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , and when they saw that they took that off and they took that with them, too, and this was, it's almost as if they took everything that was the dearest to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">First they took my father, and they then took all the dear possessions of his, and they drove away. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Interestingly, at that point, it comes -- I mean, one has to think, how did they know about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="359">The local populace must have told them, somebody must have told them. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">These were our neighbors, our friends, who worked with my father and mother, and we considered them friends, and all of a sudden they turned against us, and for no reason at all, and to this day I cannot understand why they had to be so mean and ugly.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Charlene, can you describe the day that you moved from your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , what that was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="369">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">I would go a little bit back, because as soon as they took my father away, and then they took his <span class="BUILDING">library</span> away, my mother came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work one day, one evening, and whatever we still had, a little bit of jewelry, some gold coins, she sewed in some of these coins and jewelry in each of our clothing, and her own, and my sister's, and mine, and I sort of thought it was really exciting and fun at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I said, "Why are you doing that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="372">She says, "For a rainy day." </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And, I mean, these clothes were -- 1t was my coat, I had a heavy coat, and she says, "Wherever we go, whatever we do, you take that coat.” </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And, that's what she told my sister, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">But, anyway, so we did have these things sewn in the lining of our clothing, and when the time came that we had to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we were herded into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we paid attention to take these pieces of clothing with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">What I grabbed, I remember, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> , and some underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">I was wearing my high-top shoes, even though it was in the summer, and I took that winter coat and a sweater, and I don't recall, no toys, none whatsoever, and I don't know what my -- my sister tried to grab her violin, but my mother told her to leave it, and she took some food, we had dried noodles and some food that could be -- that wasn't perishable. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">My mother took some pots and pans and some of her clothing and one suitcase, and I don't know what she threw into that suitcase, but that's all I remember that we took with us, nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">She took some blankets, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And, when we were thrown into that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we were assigned one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="381">It was a large <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , actually as far as I recall it was a three-story <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , it was in the poorest section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and it was in great disrepair. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">We were assigned this one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and there were three other families with us to share that one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">The entire <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had one <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and one <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and the running water was almost nothing, I mean there was very little water, there was no warm water, only cold water. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">If you wanted hot water you had to heat it on a wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , and there was no wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">There was not enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to sleep everyone on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and so the women, and there were two boys in that group, found some wood and they built <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , I guess, so that we slept like in threes, because there was not enough <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Most of the people in our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> were people who went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">There were only, I think, three, four of us who were not quite 14 years of age, and we were the ones who were left at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to fend for ourselves in the very beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">The people who did not go to work did not receive any rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">The rations were very meager. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I am not quite sure of the weights, but it was like maybe two slices of bread, some oleo, a little bit of sugar, and I think some vegetables. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I don't think there was any meat at all, and these rations, first they were given daily, then when the Judenrat organized everything it was done once a week, and usually by the second or third day everything was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">My mother and sister shared their rations with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">It was very difficult, and in the beginning there was an awful lot of chaos. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">The kids, like myself, the younger, were really left with nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">We were very hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">We were dirty. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We were unsupervised, and it was very difficult to comprehend what really went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We ate only at night, when our parents or whoever took care of us came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and all day there was nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Consequently, the kids, like myself, decided that we had to go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and try and get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">It was an unbelievable feeling to be hungry, and it's a hunger that is very difficult to describe, for a child to be hungry and there was nothing to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And, I was asked many times what did we play, what did we do, we pretended, and what we played about mostly is about food. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We talked about food, we pretended about -- I mean, everything centered around food. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">And so, ingeniously, we dug out two <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the <span class="DLF">fences</span> , below the <span class="DLF">fences</span> , so that a child could sneak out to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and, you know, take off the Star of David and try to act like a normal human being and see if we could obtain food. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">And, now and then, children brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> some food back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">I did it many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">It was very dangerous, because if one was caught one would pay with life. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I mean, this was the order, to shoot to kill the person, the perpetrator. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I was very lucky, and now and then I would bring a slice of bread, I would bring a carrot, or a potato, or an egg, and these were very, very great achievements. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">My mother made me promise that I wouldn't do it anymore, but I disobeyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">One time -- no, let me go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> again, in the very beginning, my mother and several other women organized a clandestine <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for children who were below the age of work, and it was a wonderful thing because we had something to look forward to. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">It made us forget about the hunger and about all the inadequacies of living such a primitive life, and this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> existed for several months. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Several of the ladies, including my mother, would barter on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and they came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with crayons, with writing paper, with some books, and I mean they would tell stories, we would sing and we would color, and it was something to look forward to. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">It was really...if it only could have lasted, but it didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">It lasted a few months, and pretty soon there was not enough jewelry or money to barter with, there were no more supplies, school supplies, and the morale sort of sagged in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">The women came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they were too tired, and too hungry, and too beaten up to be able to go and put on a happy face for us kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So, that disintegrated into nothing also. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">In the very beginning, there was like a -- not really a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but there was one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and there was still one doctor in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and somehow they obtained some medical supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And so, in the beginning there was sort of a little <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> when people got sick or needed some medications. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">But shortly after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> came into being, the doctor was grabbed in one of the round-ups, in the Lapanka, and that was the end of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">From then on, people who became ill, first they stayed in their <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , then there was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and you'd walk down the <span class="DLF">ghetto street</span> and you would see people sick, or dying, or dead, and there was a committee within the Judenrat who was in charge of burying the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And, sometimes they wouldn't get to these people for days, because it was -- there were so many of them, and there was a lot of work to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">It was a very sad sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">When one imagines the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was completely cut off from the entire world, there was no newspaper, there were no radios, there was no mail, it was like we were in <span class="NPIP">Mars</span> , not on the planet Earth. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">The only way people did get information was through the workers who were going out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they somehow would gather rumors and information from the people on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">In retrospect, I think my mother did a super human job in keeping my sister, and me fairly healthy and sane. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">It was very demoralizing to live in these conditions when we had to share one <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , and this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , this was one of the bigger <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there were about 100 people, and just to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> was a horrendous experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">There was no water to cleanse oneself. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">It was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">I remember one time when my sister and my mother, when we got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , my sister was very lucky to obtain a new job. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">My mother was still digging <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and repairing <span class="DLF">roads</span> , but my sister was able to get into an old <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> where young women were knitting and crocheting articles of clothing for the soldiers on the front, and that was a very, a choice job because you were sitting <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and, you know, it wasn't labor, you know, manual labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">One time she was ill, and she couldn't go in to work, and so, she gave me her pass and I was to take her <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And so, I gathered in front of the <span class="DLF">gate</span> with all the other young women and passed as my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">No one paid any attention, you know, as long as you had the piece of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And so, when we got into the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> I took her <span class="NPIP">place</span> , her friends showed me where she was sitting, and picked up a scarf that she started knitting the day before. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">I was not very good at what I was doing, and one of the German guards started staring at me intently, and he kept watching me for quite a while, and then he started cursing and yelling at me, and I know he said I wasn't doing it fast enough, and I still didn't do 1t much faster because I didn't know how, and he got very annoyed with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">He grabbed one of the knitting needles out of my hand and pushed it in my forefinger, and this is what it looks like now. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I passed out, and I got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that evening and that was a bitter lesson for never to try and take my sister's <span class="NPIP">place</span> for the ration that she would have lost that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">There were many awful incidents and occurrences in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">One time there were three men, young men, who tried to escape from work. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">They were working and they were trying to make their way to freedom they hoped, instead they were caught and the Germans hung them in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">It wasn't the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> , but there was a central place where we all were forced to gather and to watch the hangings. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And then, they let them hang there for several days, and each morning the people who went to work had to march by and turn their head to the right, and they were forced to look at these poor victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">There was one time when I snuck out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I was lucky to obtain two eggs, and I remember I was wearing a dress with little puffed sleeves, and I put an egg in each sleeve and tried to make my way back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">I paid for these two eggs with a small gold ring that had a ruby in it that my mother sewed into my coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I was quite proud of myself, and I just could picture my mother's and my sister's faces when they came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we had two eggs to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Just before I was entering the <span class="DLF">hole</span> , the camouflaged <span class="DLF">hole</span> back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , a Ukrainian guard spotted me, and he ran over and he started screaming at me, and he found the two eggs and threw them on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> and made me kneel down and rubbed my face in them, and screamed at me to get right back where I belonged and never to show my face again on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">I was petrified, and I didn't give away the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , the <span class="DLF">hiding entrance</span> , I marched back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , or he threw me back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and that was the end of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">I guess he was one of the kind ones because he could have killed me, or he should have killed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">When I told my mother and my sister that evening about my experience, she just hugged me. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">A few days later, one of my best friends, and I can't name her because she has family and I did not tell them about that, I didn't have the heart, she snuck out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and she obtained some bread, and as she was trying to get back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> she was caught and she was murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">They displayed her body in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for about a week, and we were forced to march by and look at her, and they didn't allow the burial society to bury her. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">These were lessons that we learned every day, and, yet, the will to live was so strong that everyone tried to survive as best as one could, and took chances, because there was no other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I snuck out many times after that and was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And, again, even though I promised my mother I wouldn't, but hunger is a very strong motivator. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I don't know if there are any adjectives with which to describe what real hunger is. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">It's a pain, a physical pain to be hungry, where your insides become like a knot and your brain stops working. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">There was no brain, it just says hunger, I want to eat, I want to eat no matter what, I want to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">That went on for a long time, like an eternity, but it seems like when winter came it was doubly difficult, because we had to contend, not only with hunger and horrible conditions of living, but there was the cold, there was no wood to heat the <span class="NPIP">places</span> , there was not enough clothing to protect us, and in spite of my mother's support and love there was creeping in a feeling of despair, and there was a lot of demoralization in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">People started being hopeless. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">There was no way out, it seemed like. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">But, again, the strongest survived, and, apparently, my sister, and I, and my mother were the few of the strongest because we did survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I don't know how. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">I think 1t was, again, my mother's constant preaching almost and telling us not to give up hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">She was an amazing person. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">She tried to instill hope where there was little hope, and she tried to make up stories and keep us entertained with everything that had a happy ending. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">How she felt <span class="NPIP">inside</span> we don't know, I know that she didn't feel that way, but she tried to transmit it and give it to us, and it did work, somehow it did work. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Somehow we lived through until the next spring, and by that time I think the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was probably diminished in population by half. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">A lot of people died of starvation and cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">Some people were taken away in the round-ups, and others died because they gave up, not because they were ill, but they just gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">They just felt they didn't have anymore strength to fight all these obstacles of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">And so, the Germans, every day there were different decrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I mean, they made life more miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">It was almost a design every day to torture by different decrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">I mean, they would demand money. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">They would demand more gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">They knew we gave it all up, no, we had to do more, we had to give more. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">It was just -- the Judenrat had a terrible time trying, you know, to be the mediator between the Germans and the Jews, and there were times, I understand, where they were having terrible arguments and discussions with our Jewish people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because it's as if they sat in judgment what to do and who to send out, and they really had no choice in what they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">By early spring, our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> dwindled to about, as I said, half, and the Germans decided we had too much <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and we were too comfortable in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and so, one day they again gathered us all in the little <span class="NPIP">place</span> , it wasn't the <span class="BUILDING">marketplace</span> because that was outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and we were told again that we can take whatever we wanted and whatever we could carry with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">By that time, our possessions were even more meager than they were last fall, and we marched again to a new <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">QUESTION:  Could we go back just a little bit so I can ask a couple questions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  What was it like in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with 100 people? </span><span class="sentence" id="483">How did people get along? </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Was it mainly women at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  Well, predominantly women, and old people, and young kids, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">There were several men, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">How did they get along? </span><span class="sentence" id="488">They tolerated one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">The women tried to do -- to be the soothe-sayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">They tried to appease everyone and to keep quiet, but tempers were rising, people were very argumentative, and people were hungry, and they were in pain, and they were not --

<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">QUESTION:  The big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">ANSWER:  Mostly, there were women. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">There were some kids, like myself, and there were some males, but, really, predominantly 1t was women, and there were some old people, very old people, some grandfathers, and several grandfathers and a grandmother, I think, there were altogether about 100 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">This was one of the largest <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">It was a three- story <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And, we did try to co-exist, and the women tried to always make peace, but tempers flared, and it was a difficult situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And, I mean, when you think that there's one <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , and one <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and I mean it was a primitive <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> too, it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So, in the beginning everybody was trying to be accommodative, but at the very end people were not as nice as one should be to one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">QUESTION:  Did it smell?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, yes, horrible smells, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I remember we used to be -- we always slept with open <span class="DLF">windows</span> , and, yet, you know, you tried to open the <span class="DLF">window</span> and other people would say it's too cold, you know, I would rather be cold than choke, you know, from the awful smells. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Yes, what a question, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  Noise? “</span><span class="sentence" id="513">Ms. Schiff is relating a story of a man from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span> whom she met after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">He had left during the war and was inquiring about his family's fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Added by Ms. Charlene Schiff in 3/94.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  Not that much noise, no, no, but the smell was awful, very, very disagreeable, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="517">QUESTION:  Can you describe when and how the children, you and the other children, dug these <span class="DLF">holes</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">It started almost like a play in the very beginning when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , it was still summer, and we said, we got together, had nothing to do, all we talked about is hunger, we said, well, let's try and dig a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And, we had some, like, shovels, actually, I don't know if they were toy shovels, but they were not full size, and there were some boys with us and they started it, and it was a game. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">We did it within three or four afternoons, because several of us had to watch, you know, on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , and it was an exciting thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">We dug two such <span class="DLF">holes</span> , and we camouflaged them so beautifully, and I'm proud to say that not one child ever gave away our two <span class="DLF">exits</span> , not one. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I don't know if the Judenrat inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> knew of the -- well, they knew that there were some illegal <span class="DLF">exits</span> , but they sort of looked the other way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="524">QUESTION:  How did you camouflage them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  We camouflaged them with like rags, there was no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> or anything, stones, and broken <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> , and it was just done so that nobody paid any attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And, on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , there was grass, and there were leaves, and I mean it just looked very normal, and some plaster and stuff like that on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , but not on the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">It was done beautifully. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">I was very proud. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I was not the main engineer of it, but there were some kids who were just wonderful at doing that, and it gave us a way of getting out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">QUESTION:  When you went in and out, did anybody stand guard?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">ANSWER:  Yes, oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">It was a very well-organized --
QUESTION:  Can you describe it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  Well, what we did, first of all, for instance I said I want to go tomorrow, you know, so there were three or four of us together, and there was also an agreement, whoever went out, and whatever you got, in the beginning we tried to share, but then it was very -- it was not feasible. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">If somebody got a slice of bread, you wanted it for your family, so we decided whatever one got it was for him, or for her, and her family, and we took turns. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And there were about 20 or 30 kids, and we took turns in standing guard, and who would get out, and mostly we volunteered to get out, because we wouldn't say, well, you go, but mostly we volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And I went out a number of times, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And I don't know if I should be proud, it's nothing to be proud of, but when my friend was killed there was one other boy who was also murdered, but that was almost at the very end of the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and they buried him right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">I don't know why, maybe because they knew we were going to move pretty soon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">QUESTION:  You saw your friend killed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="540">ANSWER:  Yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">She was a beautiful girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">She was probably one, she looked like a baby doll, she had blond hair and blue eyes, and she was so beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">When she'd walk down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , people turned their heads to look at her, she was so -- her features were so perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">She was my friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">She was about a year older than I, and we became very good friends before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because we didn't live very far away from one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And then, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we were even better friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">She had a mother and one brother, and she had a brother who left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="548">QUESTION:  This must have been difficult for you to see her, you saw her murdered?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">ANSWER:  It was very traumatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I mean anybody, to see the hangings, and to see other incidents like that, were very traumatic, but this, this was my friend, my dear friend, and she looked so peaceful, and there was blood on her dress, and she looked like she was asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And, my mother kept comforting me, and she kept saying, "She's not suffering anymore, she's not in pain." </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Her mother died, my friend's mother died about a month after my friend was murdered in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">In the spring, when the Germans decided we had too much <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> and we were too comfortable, they built a new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">I thought that was the poor section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Well, the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was really in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">slums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">This was a group of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> or a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> where most people did not live for years already, but there were just a few dilapidated <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">The only difference between the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the old was that the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was surrounded by a high <span class="DLF">fence</span> and barbed wire on three sides, and the fourth side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was bordered by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And, that part, that side, was not -- did not have any <span class="DLF">fences</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">We were assigned a little nook in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> right on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and, again, I mean, it was -- my mother made the best with what she had. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">We tried to make it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and the main thing was to have enough <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> to sleep everyone on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">And, again, they had to build these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , because there was not enough <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> to sleep all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">This time, we had only two other families with us in that little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and these were all women and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">There were no boys, or elderly or men. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">My mother and my sister kept going to work again, as if, you know, nothing happened, or, I mean, as if they were still in the old <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and rumors began to fly that our end was near. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">It was spring, 1942, and my mother tried desperately while she was working, when she was on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , to make contact with some of our friends from before. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">She wanted to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where someone would hide the three of us, because that's what everyone tried to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Finally, one day she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and she was very excited, and she told us that she found two <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">She couldn't find one <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the farmer or the people would be willing to hide three people, so she found two. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">One <span class="NPIP">place</span> would hide one person, and another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the people were willing to take two people. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">And, there was my mother's difficult decision, how and who should go where. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And in her infinite wisdom, she decided that my sister, being the older one, would be able to manage on her own, and mother and I would go to the other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And, by that time, I mean, she was making plans, or she was excited, or she tried to be excited for our sake, and she kept telling us exactly where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I don't recall the name of the farmer that my sister was going to, but that was on the edge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and he -- the plans were that he would pick her up after work one evening, and that one morning when we all got up, we ate our meager breakfast, and my sister took her little bundle with her, the most important things, clothing that she still had. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">She wasn't crying, and I wasn't crying either. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">We hugged, we embraced, and we said goodbye, and my mother kept saying how wonderful it would be when all this is over, we'll meet again, and papa will come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we'll have great celebrations. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And so, she and my sister went to work, and that evening my mother came back by herself, and she told me that sister went off and everything was working according to her plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And I don't recall exactly, 1t wasn't the same evening, but maybe a few short days later, when there really were signs in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> that something was happening, we saw the number of the guards increase immeasurably. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I think they doubled the guards around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and there were a lot more Germans tn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and right <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And, one sensed that there was some commotion, something was taking place. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">At that point, I knew that people really became hysterical, and a lot of people started building partitions in their, you know, <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , thinking that they could build like false <span class="DLF">walls</span> with scraps that they got from somewhere, and if they hide in these partitions, in these false <span class="DLF">walls</span> , that the Germans wouldn't find them. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">Some people, you know, would make a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> in the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and some of them went and dug <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> and <span class="DLF">tunnels</span> , all this within I think like two weeks after we moved to the new <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Anyway, there was a lot of panic and chaos in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> at that point, and a few days after my sister left, my mother came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work and she says, "It's time to go.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And so, she made me dress in my best clothes, and, again, I still had that coat with a few sewn in coins, and I put on my high-top shoes, and she got dressed and whatever she felt was still not threadbare, and she made two little bundles, one for myself and one for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">We ate our meager supper, and when it got dark, really dark, it was a dark night, 1t was very quiet, we stepped out of our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , we didn't tell anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">At that point, no one shared information with anyone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">It seems like everyone was an entity unto oneself. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">We walked out, we didn't say goodbye to anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And pretty soon we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">It was very quiet, and there were a lot of bulrushes and there's a lot of underbrush, and I held on tightly to my mother's hand, and all of a sudden shots rang out, and we ducked, and when it stopped we proceeded a little further. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">But then, the gunshots were sporadic, but we could not move because it was still, and when we moved we made noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And so, we just stayed there, and we stayed the entire night, because these sporadic gunshots were making it impossible for us to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">The next morning, there were no sporadic gunshots, it was regular now, and it seemed to come from every which <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">We heard a lot of noise, a lot of commotion, we saw fire, we heard screams, we heard babies crying, and it seems that it was none to soon that we got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">At that point, a lot of other people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> tried to do the very same thing we did, and they ran towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">At that time, the guards started screaming, the Ukrainian guards, and this is a phrase in Ukrainian "Wylaz Zyde ya tebe bachu," and that means, "crawl out, Jew, I can see you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="596">That phrase rings in my ears constantly, and a lot of people came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">My mother held me down and we stayed put. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And, that went on for several days, and my mother made me eat the soggy bread that was in the bundle. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">It tasted awful, and she kept saying I have to be strong, and I can't give up now, and she kept giving me directions of how to get to the <span class="BUILDING">farmer's house</span> on the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> that was supposed to have been our <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And I felt I knew, and I told her, "Stop repeating it, I know how to get there," because we used to go there before the war and my mother used to buy some of the dairy products, like milk, and cheese, and butter from that farmer, so I knew his name, I knew his family, and I knew where he lived, only we didn't go through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , we went all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">That was in a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Skobelka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And we stayed pinned down, and at that point the gunshots were working full time. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">There were screams from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and fire, and it never let down even at night, night and day. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I don't know how many days we stayed 1n the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , but it was several days, and I kept dozing off. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And one time I woke up, or I thought I woke up, and I looked around, and my mother wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I really became panic stricken, and I didn't know what to do, and I just stayed there until the very end of that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And, by that time, everything quieted down. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">There was no more sound except my own sobbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">It was so still. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And, somehow at that moment I felt I let my mother down. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I fell asleep, and she probably couldn't wake me up, and she had to leave, and so, when it got real dark I made my way to the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and by that time 1t was dawn. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I was wet, and petrified, and utterly confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">I made my way to the <span class="BUILDING">farmer's house</span> , and the farmer saw me and he led me into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , and I asked him, "Is my mother here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="615">He said, "No.” </span><span class="sentence" id="616">I said, "Well, she is supposed to be here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="617">He says, "Yes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I said, "Well, I'll wait until she comes.” </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And, he said, "No, you will not wait here. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I'll feed you, you'll stay until 1t gets dark, and you better leave.” </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And, I looked at him, I said, "You made an agreement with my mother," and I asked -- I mean, I addressed him by his name, which I don't want to give now because I think I have a lot of questions and I would like to resolve them some day before I die when I go back there, and I asked him, "You made an agreement.” </span><span class="sentence" id="622">He said, "I changed my mind," and he shrugged his shoulders and he said I have to go when it gets dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">If I don't go, he'll report me to the authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">It was very ironic, because he was wearing a farmer's, like a coverall, and in the corner I saw my father's gold pocket watch with the chain, which I'm sure was part of the money that my mother tried to buy the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">That evening, he didn't even come out, his wife came out, the farmer's wife came out, and gave me some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">She gave me an apple, and she said I had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I was so stupefied and so bewildered, I walked out and I walked on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , not realizing that anyone could see me and give me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">But, I just, I don't know, if there is a God he must have been with me, because I walked through the main <span class="DLF">street</span> of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and didn't encounter anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And finally I ended up in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> which were right on that <span class="DLF">farm</span> , I guess, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">There were <span class="DLF">fields</span> , <span class="DLF">wheat fields</span> , all around, and they were almost ripe for harvesting at that time of year, and I sat down in the middle of the <span class="DLF">wheat fields</span> and I sat there for two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">My food went, and I tried to gather my thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I had a terrible sinking feeling that I let down my mother, and I felt very guilty about it, and right then and there I decided that I must find my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And that's when my odyssey really starts. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">The <span class="REGION">area</span> where I come from is surrounded by many, many <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> , and I felt, or I tried to feel, that my mother was there waiting for me and I had to find her, no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And so, I started, I knew that I would have to go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> , and I started walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">And, the thing was that when you look at a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> it looks so close, and yet when you really start trying to reach tt, it's much further than your mind tells you it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And so, I walked most of the nights and hid in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">But then, there was another problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">One had to eat, and I was hungry, and so, I had to find <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> that were near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where I could sneak into a <span class="DLF">garden</span> , or a <span class="DLF">yard</span> , or a <span class="INT_SPACE">potato cellar</span> , or something where I could get something to keep me from dying from hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">The very beginning, the first months, were very, very painful, very -- I mean, it's almost like I was in a daze. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Several things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">One of them, which, again, is riveted in my memory, was an incident that involved six other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">The very first months after I was wandering in my search for my mother, I encountered stragglers from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , apparently, most of the surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , were liquidated around the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">It was the fall of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And so, we would sit and exchange some information and try to find out if, perhaps, they knew anything about our loved ones and vice versa. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And so that at one time there were six other people, some of them from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lokacze</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beresteczko</span> , and a few other neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And there we were at the edge of a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , exchanging information and just glad to see other human beings like ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">All of a sudden, there were some children playing and they noticed us and they started screaming "Zhid"--just yelling "Zhide, Zhide," meaning "Jews"--and they ran back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">There was a very small remuneration for reporting a Jew, and I'm sure they wanted to report Jews and get the money for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And so we didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">First we tried to run into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">That <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> happened to have been a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> where there was very little underbrush and consequently one could see very far, so 1t was not very good for hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">There were many huge haystacks in that <span class="DLF">field</span> because it was harvest time, and so we decided to go into a haystack to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Why we all selected one haystack, I cannot answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">But we all ran into one haystack, and we tried to cover ourselves as best as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Pretty soon we heard the children back and adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And they made a game out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">They kept pushing their pitchforks into the haystack. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And there were screams and cries, and after it got completely quiet, that was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I waited and waited and waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">It was quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And it seemed it was an eternity, and then I made my way out of that haystack. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And there I saw six bodies lined up in front of the haystack, mutilated. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">The only one I recognized there was a baby--that child must have been maybe two years old--that baby was on the chest of his mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">They were all undressed, their shoes taken away, lined up very neatly. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I didn't even cover them, I just walked away. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And I walked into that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide and I walked and walked and there was no end to that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And so I decided to climb up a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And a good thing too because that next morning--for some reason I don't know, it was near a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> or something--but that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> was full of Germans and Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">They had a picnic or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And I sat there on that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> trying not to move all day long. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I'm sure if I had been below, I would have been found. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">It was really torture because the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> were, evergreens, you know, and they hurt when I was sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">But I sat there all day without moving. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> just like that, under me. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And when night fell and they left, I climbed down and started walking until I got to another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , which was I think dawn of the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">There were many awful incidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I remember once I didn't feel well, I was very hungry and I was very thirsty also. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Thirst is just as bad and just as painful as hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And with my hands I clawed, I dug a little <span class="DLF">hole</span> and I climbed tn and I covered myself with leaves and I just lay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">I must have fallen asleep, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">When I woke up, I felt better.

were snakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">There were smaller animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I saw a bear one time, I think at that point, I did; and the only reason I can figure out that they didn't touch me is because I smelled like them. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I'm sure they thought I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Not one

QUESTION:  Charlene, we were talking about the partisans and they wouldn't let you in because you didn't have a weapon.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">ANSWER:  Yes, they made fun -- the partisans made fun of my weapon, a little penknife. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Well, again, I was very saddened that I would be alone, but I got even with them in my own way, before I left I appropriated a warm long coat, a pair of boots, they were different sizes, I remember that, but they were warm boots, and some mittens and a shawl, a lot of warm clothing, and they had lots of it, and also I took some food, and I just left. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">My life in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> 1s very hard to analyze. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I think what kept me going is my quest, I mean my search for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Maybe deep in my heart I realized that I would never find her, but I was afraid to admit it, because if I had admitted that, I would have given up, and I had to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So, I pretended, I think in retrospect I guess, I pretended that I'm looking for her and that I would find her no matter what. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">So, I kept on going. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And, the hunger was awful, the thirst was awful, the cold was indescribable, terror and being afraid of everything and anything, because anything alive was my enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">But, more than anything else was the pain of being all alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Sometimes weeks and months went by without my hearing another human voice, and that is something that I cannot convey in words how painful and difficult it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">I started talking to myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I listened for sounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Sometimes I imagined that I heard voices of people, and usually when I heard people's voices they didn't bode me anything good, and, yet, I longed for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">So, in addition to being terrorized and tortured by all these uncertainties and fears, I missed a human voice, the sound of a human voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Sometimes I would sneak into a <span class="DLF">yard</span> to a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , because I was hungry, but more so because I wanted to hear the sound of a human voice, and that was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I never felt that I could go on without living, without hearing another human's voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I could go on with hunger and thirst, but I couldn't go on for any length of time without hearing a human voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">It was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">There were many close calls that I had that I can't even begin to describe. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">One time I -- I don't know if I told that before, but I saw the Galowy, that's the man in charge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , a forester, is that what you call them here, and he came up out of nowhere it seemed like. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I was in my little <span class="DLF">grave</span> , every <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> that I planned to spend more than a day in I tried to dig a little <span class="DLF">hole</span> and camouflage it, and all of a sudden I looked up and there he was on a horse, and I didn't even hear him coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And, he was kind, but he says, "What are you doing here? </span><span class="sentence" id="728">You are not going to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I'm going to take you to the authorities, it's better that you give up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I said, "No, I'm not going to give up if you don't denounce me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And, finally, I took out a gold coin and that gold coin saved my life then. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I still had two gold coins left after that, and each time they bought me my life in a roundabout way, and this guy came back, he followed me, and about a month later he followed me into another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and he knew that I had some more money, and so I gave him the next coin, and the third one I gave to the Russians, that was later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">How I lived in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , or in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> , plural, I don't know, but it's an amazing thing, when one is hungry and completely demoralized, you become inventive. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I never, when I even say it I don't believe it, I ate worms, I ate bugs, I ate anything that I could put in my mouth, and I don't know, sometimes I would get very ill, there were some wild mushrooms, I'm sure they were poison, I don't know, poisonous ones, I was ill, my stomach was a mess, but I still put it in my mouth because I needed to have something to chew. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I drank water from puddles, snow, anything that I could get hold of. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Sometimes I would sneak into <span class="INT_SPACE">potato cellars</span> that the farmers have around their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , and that was a good hiding place because it was a little warmer in the winter, but there were rodents there and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And, to say that I ate raw rats, yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Apparently, I wanted to live very, very badly, because I did indescribable things. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I ate things that no one would dream of being able to. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Somehow I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I don't know why, I keep asking myself, but I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">To this day, I'm still looking for my parents and my sister, none of them survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I tried to go back, and it seems every year I remember more details, but I try not to, I try to forget, but I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I feel that I'm a prisoner of my memories, and I'm imprisoned in a <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> that I can't break away from. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">But, I do feel that I have a mandate, and I must speak out for the millions who never had a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">I'm their spokesperson. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I have to tell the world what went on, so we can learn from these past mistakes, from the cruelty, and from the inhumanity of man towards man. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">I'm saddened that in this day and age we have learned very little, and I've had several incidents where after I made a short presentation to school children a parent was questioning the truthfulness of my story, and verbatim he said, "Oh, come on, that's a figment of your imagination," and that makes me very sad, and it makes me more determined to tell the world my story, because it did happen, and it should not happen ever again. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I'm sure you want to know more details about my life in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I don't know how I can tell you much more, except to tell you that I lived just like an animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I ate and drank human waste, but I never killed another human being, and I don't think that should I meet face to face with people who are responsible for my parents' and my sister's murder, and for the millions of others, I don't think I'm capable of killing another human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I could even forgive, but I cannot forget, and I do not want the world to forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And, my message to people who will listen to my story is that, in spite of all this I do feel that there 1s hope for humankind, and we must learn from the atrocities and from the past that were so unkind to me and to millions of others.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Charlene, can you tell me what a day was like in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">ANSWER:  The day started when it started getting light, and usually at that time I would reach a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , because I had to walk all night long. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">My one good thing was the darkness. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">So, early in the morning I would find a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> , dig a <span class="DLF">hole</span> and cover myself and sleep, because I was exhausted from all the walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Then, if I had something to eat, I would eat around noon or so, and then I would start wandering again in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and make my plans for the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">That was on good days, when I was healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">Many times, I would dig myself into a <span class="DLF">grave</span> and cover myself and stay there for days until I'd lose count, yes, until I was just so hungry, or so thirsty, that I had to get up and go, but I would stay in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> for many days at times.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">QUESTION:  Did you have nightmares?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I think the whole life was like a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I have nightmares now, but at that point I think it was all like a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">I kept hoping to wake up. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">It was -- that's a very interesting question -- I think it was all very unreal to me, because it was not reality, and I lived in a very unreal world. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">I don't know if it was pretending or what, but it seemed maybe it was a self-defense mechanism, I did not think it was real. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">I don't know if I had nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  Did you have daydreams?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">ANSWER:  Yes, oh, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I remember once seeing a rainbow after a rain in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and it was so beautiful, I will never forget that rainbow. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And, I kept imagining and I kept remembering how my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> looked back when, and I even smelled the smell, there are certain aromas now that, you know, I associate with <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and there was in that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , which I loved the smell of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> anyway, even under these circumstances, but I smelled the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">grass</span> , and the leaves, and the earth, it was beautiful, but I smelled flowers, because when I looked at a rainbow I saw flowers, I saw the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shrubs</span> , and I saw the jasmine and lilacs that surrounded our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and that was very pleasant and it gave me strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">Yes, I guess you can call it a daydream, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">I wished that I had some tangible proof, or a photograph or something, of my parents and my sister, and I should have packed that in my bundle, but I didn't have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I didn't have anything, any tangible proof, or anything that I could look and remind myself, because some days I was just wondering who I am, and who my family was. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">It's almost as if I couldn't visualize 1t in my mind, and I had to strain to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">That was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">One time I ran into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and ended up in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , helped myself to milk from a cow, and then they found me, a boy came into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and saw me, and I started running. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">There was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, and he ran for his parents, apparently, and I ran and there was a <span class="DLF">well</span> sort of, I guess, on the edge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="785">I don't know if 1t was an abandoned <span class="DLF">well</span> or what, and I jumped in and I stayed there, I think, for a day and a half, and they didn't find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">But, I had to claw myself out of there, and, you know, the <span class="DLF">walls</span> were round, and there was nothing to latch onto. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">That was a difficult thing, but I did somehow, I clawed myself out of that <span class="DLF">well</span> , and that's another experience.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="791">ANSWER:  I saw it was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">Yes, there's no logic to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">It's Just like when we went into the haystack, why did we all go into one haystack? </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And, they were huge haystacks, and I don't know if I explained, but when I told the story to my husband and son, they listened, but they didn't ask any questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And, I guess they didn't have the heart, but when we went back on our trip in 1988, we were in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and my son almost jumped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , he said, "Oh, here, so that's what a haystack looks like.” </span><span class="sentence" id="796">They are huge haystacks there, just like a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , because here the haystacks are very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And, there, they make them very big, and he says, "Now, I understand how seven people could hide in one haystack.” </span><span class="sentence" id="798">I said, "If you didn't understand, why didn't you ask me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="799">He says, "I just didn't have the heart to ask." </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I saw the <span class="DLF">well</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">There was no other <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">It was too far to go to a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and I just jumped in, and they never looked there.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="841">ANSWER:  I would reach out and I would talk to them, sing to them, and they were all good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">The bear licked me, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">I don't know if it was an old, old mother bear, I don't know, but she licked my face, he, she, it, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I can't explain it. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">There were foxes, who huddled down next to me, kept me warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Yes, there were, I don't know, animals that I don't know the name of, but there were deer, you know, beautiful, graceful deer, they didn't come very close, but they would stand and look at me and I'd look right back at them, you know, and their beautiful, graceful heads, you know, just cocked to one <span class="NPIP">side</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">QUESTION:  So, they were like comfort to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="849">ANSWER:  Yes, great comfort, and to think now I'm afraid of my own shadow.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="850">QUESTION:  You must have missed affection a great deal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">ANSWER:  Yes, I did, and that's why now I'm a hugger, I love to hug people, and I'm very affectionate. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">I missed it, and I'm trying to make up for it, and you can never make up for lost time. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">I've lost my childhood and my youth, and I can't make up for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">I also have a great gap in my formal education, and that's another thing that I can never make up for. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I know my father would have been very disappointed in me today, I hope not, but he stressed education so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I do want to bring out another thing, and I know I'm jumping now, this 1s already after the war ended, I was liberated by the Russians, by the Soviet Union soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">Again, I was in one of my little <span class="DLF">graves</span> , and I was very ill, I don't know how long, but it was the spring of -- it was spring, I don't remember, and there I was and all of a sudden somebody was shaking me, and there were these two pair of boots, that's what I saw from my vantage point, and these were two Russian soldiers, and they kept saying, "devushka, devushka, little girl, little girl" and they shook me, and I finally woke up, and I was very ill, and they took me to a <span class="BUILDING">military hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="858">You see, they were still -- the war was still going on, and those were the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> , and they happened to stumble upon me. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">They were very kind to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">They nursed me back to health. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I was in several different <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">And, it was an act of mercy in a way, and I cannot adequately describe how gentle and kind they were to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">I hear other stories, and, I'm sorry, I cannot verify them, to me they were very good and they were my liberators, and I'll be forever grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">But, after the war, when we started, everybody was searching for their loved ones, and I still didn't give up my quest, my search for my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And, we were told that everyone who survived was gathering in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and if we want to find our loved ones, that's where we have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And so, we went, when I say "we," there were groups, I wasn't alone at that time, and in a way I found a lot of comfort in other people, people like myself, but I wasn't alone, so we all went. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">We went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luck</span> , which is near my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span> , we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , which was <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , it was after the war, because we still had to wait a while from the time I was rescued, I think it was about eight or nine months before the war came to an end, so we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="868">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="869">And, right after the war ended, they formed, when I say "they," I guess it was the Joint Distribution Committee from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , UNRRA* at that point, and some other committees, formed displaced persons' camps, we called them <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">In the very beginning, it was curious that we were all thrown together. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And, when I say "all," I mean the survivors, the remnants of the survivors, the people who helped the Germans and were running now from punishment, so to speak, so we all ended up in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were no -- I mean, they were no -- I mean, it wasn't a very comfortable life, but it was <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> by comparison, but still, it was pretty rough, but the roughest thing was to confront these people who -- I didn't recognize anyone, but there were some of my compatriots who recognized Ukrainians and Poles who helped the Germans, and said, "What are you doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="873">you know, and, consequently, it was very tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And, I mean, fights were going on all the time, and they finally did separate us and put us in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="875">But, I mean, a lot of these people pretended or said lies on their visas and ended up in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> being our neighbors. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I would like to also bring out another thing that bothers me in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">Here I was, and I'm speaking from a personal point of view, and I know I'm not the only one, there I was an orphan, a survivor of unspeakable pain and atrocities of the war, and nobody extended a helping hand during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Now, after the war, wouldn't you think we would have priority to go out or to get out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="879">But, no, I had to wait three long years. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">There were quotas. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">There were always quotas. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">There were quotas to get into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="883">When I finally did get hold of my family in the United *The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">States, because I remembered my grandmother's address, I still -- I mean, they guaranteed that I would not be a burden to the government, and, yet, I had to wait three long years before I was allowed to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Meanwhile, I tried on my own to get a student's visa, and I attended the <span class="BUILDING">University of Heidelberg</span> for almost -- well, over a year, but that would have given me a student visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">I must say that the people at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Heidelberg</span> bent backwards to accommodate me. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">There were such gaps in my formal education, it was non-existent, and, yet, I took some tests and they helped me and I was accepted as a full-time student. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">And, I will never forget that, I'm grateful for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">But, I still had to wait three years to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and I don't think that was right to treat us 1n such a way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">QUESTION:  How was it in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="891">ANSWER:  Well, I was in several. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">It was -- we had <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , each one of us was assigned a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="893">We had a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> once a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">We had rations, and now and then I would get -- we would get care packages, and the care packages had cigarettes, and cigarettes were a very welcomed commodity, it was traded for necessities of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">And, that's the way we lived, or that's the way I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And then I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and started again searching for my family, and it's very -- I don't know how to bring it out, but it seems to me to this day, I am not at peace with myself because I have nothing tangible to mourn. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">When one dies, there is a <span class="DLF">grave</span> , a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , I have nothing, and maybe that's why to this day I'm hoping against hope, I know it's ridiculous, that, perhaps, I could find someone in my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">To this day, when I walk on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and I see a person who 1s very tall, my father was about 6'4", and my mother was almost 6 foot tall, and when I see people of that height and build I have to run in front of them to verify that that's not them, and that's very difficult for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">In 1988, my son expressed a desire to go back where I came from, he wanted to see the surroundings. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And, after about a year of red tape, the Soviet Union allowed me to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , but they said that if I wanted to go to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , which is an insignificant little dot on the map, they cannot allow me now, they will let me know when I get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> whether or not they would allow me to go to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And so, we took our chances and we did go. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I couldn't go directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="903">They told me I had to go via, at that time <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leningrad</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , and that is a story of another -- for another time. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">We were supposed to be with a group, a tour group, because otherwise, you know, I could have gone on my own, they said, no, you can't do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">When we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leningrad</span> , we come to the tourist people, and I said, "Where is the group we are supposed to join?" </span><span class="sentence" id="906">There was no group, so we were left on our own anyway, but, yet, I mean, the bureaucracy was such that I had to fight for everything until we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , and it's a good thing I still speak the language, or else we would have been lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">But, anyway, we went, we finally ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> , and that evening we were let know, they let us know that they gave us permission to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span> , my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , for two hours only, and they stood there with their watches, you know, watching. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Why, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">I cannot understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">When we finally got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span> , we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and we had two drivers. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">These two drivers were supposedly our guides, but they really were the KGB men, and mind you, that's 1988, where when we had already glasnost and perestroika to some degree. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">We got to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="913">I don't know where reality ends and imagination begins, but it seems that was not my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="914">There were no <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">There were no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="916">There was nothing the way I remembered it. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">I looked for my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and finally an elderly gentleman, I mean, they came out of the woodwork, there were many people who came out, and they all, of course, remembered my family, and, of course, if they would only have been able to help they would have, so they tell me then, and they pointed out the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , supposedly, that was my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">It's still there, but it doesn't look anything like my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="919">It's still on a <span class="DLF">terraced hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="920">There are no shrubs, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">On either side of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , they added <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , and they painted the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , it was plaster, I guess you call it, they painted it a horrible color of blue, and there was a woman standing in the <span class="DLF">door</span> as if daring me to go up. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">I didn't have the heart, and I could not do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">So, I didn't go in, but it didn't even look like my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Our son had a camera, and he tried to go around the side of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to take a picture from the back, and he sort of disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">I didn't pay much attention. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">I tried to ask about things 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and any information about my family and the rest of the Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and all of a sudden one of our guides heard screams, a mother, I'm a mother, and I didn't hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And, there was my son screaming, "help, help.” </span><span class="sentence" id="928">It turned out they ran, and I ran with them, and so did my husband, and we ran around the corner and there were two militia men, local militia men from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span> , who tried to kidnap my son in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> and drive off. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">He doesn't speak Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">He didn't know, you know, what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">They tried to force him into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">van</span> to drive off, and that's when a little fight ensued between the local militia and the two -- the guides who whipped out their KGB cards and then they let my son go. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">That's in 1988. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">I managed, I didn't, I know they erased, they leveled the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , I didn't get to see anything, because time was taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">I managed to find out that the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> in which I was hiding was diverted, there was no <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">I did not see the <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but they told me there 1s no more <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="936">They verified again about my sister, that she was denounced, paraded in the nude and murdered within days of the liquidation of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="937">My father, they think, he ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , but I'm not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">When we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war, I mean after I got married, my husband was stationed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , and we went up several times to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and I looked and asked, but there is no way to verify whether or not my father was murdered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="939">But, there is another possibility now. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">They told me when I went back in '88 that there was a <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> on the outside of my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , and possibly the 300 men who were grabbed in the very beginning of the German occupation ended up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">I don't know, and I was not given a chance to see that <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">No one knows anything about my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">No one could give me any information. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">Of all the Jews, as far as I know, there is only one other survivor, an older lady who lives in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> also, and there are some other survivors, but these are people who made their way from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> in an illegal way as the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">That's as far as I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">I might be incorrect, but I have not found any other SUIVIVOTS.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">QUESTION:  Let's go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">When you first had to put on the Star, your mother sewed it on?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="971">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">Is 1t time for me to read it now? </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Before I read it, I want to explain something. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I'm having very difficult times, at times I'm very angry at God, and at times I question his existence, and in 1985, with the help of a wonderful Rabbi, Rabbi Elster, who was the Rabbi of Agudas Achim in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> , he was a personal friend, he was a military chaplain in 19 - in the early 1960s, and that's the way we met him, my husband and I, and we've kept up our friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And, he 1s, in a way, responsible for my speaking out. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">He was the first one who dragged me in, practically dragged me in, to a confirmation class, and he said, "Now, you will speak and you will tell them your story.” </span><span class="sentence" id="978">I said, "But, Rabbi, my English isn't perfect. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">I can't, I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I don't want to.” </span><span class="sentence" id="981">He says, "You are going to do it," and I did it the first time, and this is the way things evolved. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">He is responsible for it, and the gathering of 1983, when I realized that I have a mandate and I have to speak out. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">This poem that I'm going to read was a poem that I wrote in 1985, when I decided, with the help of Rabbi Elster, to become a Bat Mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">All I knew about Hebrew is that it goes from right to left. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">I didn't know the alphabet. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">I was very ignorant in that <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="987">He, with his help in three months, I mastered all that is needed to become a Bat Mitzvah, and not just superficially. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">I chanted my entire Haftorah. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">I did all the prayers in Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">I conducted almost the entire Saturday service in three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">And, I thought that by doing that my faith, my religion, will come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">It was a catharsis for about a year, and now I'm struggling with it all over again, and this is the poem that I wrote on the occasion of my Bat Mitzvah.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1004">ANSWER:  Well, I want to tell you about this trip in 1988, which was very memorable for many reasons, and one very poignant incident happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lvov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">We went to the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> , where my father used to teach, and this was very meaningful to our son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">He was, at that point, he just finished <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> , and I have always stressed education and, I mean, it seemed that, he says, here I am walking literally in the footsteps of my grandfather, he was at that point an assistant professor at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , and he said, "This is the first time I can connect," because in my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Horochow</span> he couldn't connect, there was nothing to connect with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">As we walked into the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , which I vaguely remember these huge <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , but this one special -- specifically, one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and there was this old hunch-backed gentleman, and he says, "Can I help you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">And, I said, "Yes, I would like to just look around," and I told him who I was, and "this is my son," and I don't know if he did it because he wanted to please me or, you know, he saw the anguish in my face, he said, "I remember your father," and he was such a nice gentleman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And, he said, "He always said hello to me." </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">I don't know if it's true, but it made me feel good, and it made my son feel very, very -- I can't say happy - but it gave him something to think about and something to remember about a grandfather that to him is just stories, you know, and one picture that I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And, I thought that was one very, very pleasing or good moment in our trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">I would like to bring to the attention of my listeners, my future listeners, that in 1988, so many years after the war, we went to see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and we also stopped at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babi Yar</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1013"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babi Yar</span> is a place where a hundred thousand mostly Jews were murdered by the Germans within ten days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">When we ended up -- when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> , we wanted to take one of the normal tours, as we did in every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , to see all the most important things in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and we did that, and it was finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And, I said, "Well, we didn't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babi Yar</span> ," and our guide says, "Oh, we don't go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babi Yar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">You want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babi Yar</span> , you make your own arrangements." </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">So that, right away, made me very angry, but we did make arrangements, and next morning we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babi Yar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">First of all, the guide keeps telling us about the hundred thousand Soviet citizens who were murdered there, no mention about Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">Then, there is -- what do you call it when you commemorate -- a <span class="DLF">memorial</span> , a <span class="DLF">memorial</span> , and on the <span class="DLF">memorial</span> in Russian it says that Russian citizens, 100,000 of them, were murdered here, no mention of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">I got very angry, and I really gave them a piece of my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">It wasn't because of me, but now I understand they have a new memorial that explains that they were mostly Jews and they commemorate the right people who were murdered there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Another thing, they kept saying nobody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> knew what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Well, the geographical location of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Babi Yar</span> is right in the middle of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , how people could be deaf and blind is beyond me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">That's one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">When we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had several million Jews, now they have, I think, 5,000 Jews in the entire country of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">The anti-semitism in 1988, you could taste it, you could slice it with a knife, it was in the <span class="DLF">air</span> everywhere, and everywhere they took us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , starting with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , there was no mention of Jews, Polish citizens were murdered here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And, I, again, expressed my very, very unhappiness with the state of affairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">I understand that it's being corrected now, but I spent a week in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , that if I didn't die out of frustration and anger, it was just so obvious that the anti-semitism is still there, and I'm not accusing anyone specifically, but the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as a whole. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">And, I'm sorry I feel that way, and people might disagree with me, but, unfortunately, in 1988 all I felt is hate and despicable distaste for the Jews that the Poles have there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">And I feel it's unfair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">There are no Jews there to hate anymore, and, yet, it was so obvious everywhere we went that the Jews are very much disliked there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1032">QUESTION:  Charlene, when you were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , how did you decide where to go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1033">ANSWER:  I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">I just went happenstance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">I learned how to, you know, tell north, south, east and west, and I kept going east, then after a while I went south, and that's the only way I went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">I don't know, I did not have any plans of where to go and how. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">The <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> are, they stretch for miles, and miles and miles, and thank God I had good legs, I guess, because I don't know how many hundreds of miles I must have walked in these years that I was there, but there was no plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">I might have ended up in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , for all I know, several times, I recognized them, yes, but I had no plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">I didn't know what I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">It was all -- you mentioned before, it was almost all unreal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">It was something was driving me to keep on going, and that was, I guess, the spirit of my mother, because I felt I had to find her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">But, how I went and what I did, there was no plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">I had no plan, none whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1045">QUESTION:  What did you do for shoes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1046">ANSWER:  Well, I had a pair of shoes, then they fell apart, and I used the leaves with boughs of evergreen, you know, to tie them around, and the next year I had those wonderful boots from the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">One was about two sizes too big, and the other one was a little too small, but who cared, they were wonderful, yes, that's what I did for shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">But, I think the partisans, in some way, even though they didn't allow me to join their group, they saved my life, too, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1049">QUESTION:  Why don't we change the tape and go to a half hour tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Can we do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">End of Tape #3 Tape #4
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">You were talking about shoes, and your change of shoes, and how many miles you walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Can you talk a little more about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1055">ANSWER:  Well, yes, I don't know how many miles, but it must have been, if I say a thousand in the years, probably more, I know I walked, and walked and walked, and the original shoes, the ones--the high-tops, fell apart, and for a time I didn't have anything, I just put leaves and the evergreen -- the longer branches and wrapped them around, and that was all I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And, sometimes I would get into the <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> and get some straw, but I didn't have anything to fasten it with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">One time I remember getting a little bit of burlap in a <span class="INT_SPACE">potato cellar</span> and I made string out of that and tied the leaves around my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">It was very rough until I got new shoes, and the new shoes were the boots that I appropriated from the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">But, until then, mostly I had no shoes, and I walked barefoot in the snow, and it was terribly cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">Part of my toes, you know, have no circulation, they are frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">My hands are also partially frozen, frostbitten, and my stomach 1s ruined. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">Otherwise, I'm all right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1063">QUESTION:  Did you have a hat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1064">ANSWER:  No, no, no, I didn't have a hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">When the partisans, you know, left me to myself, I appropriated a shawl, and I wrapped my head at that time, but until then, no, I did not have a hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">I had long hair, and sometimes I chopped it up with my little penknife because I had lice, and I was itching, and I had sores, and it was very difficult to take care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">So, now and then I would chop it off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1068">QUESTION:  How did you use your penknife?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1069">ANSWER:  Oh, the penknife was used for a million and one -- for everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">I used it to help me dig my little <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I used it to cut up my potatoes, my raw potatoes, to cut vegetables from the <span class="DLF">gardens</span> , or I sometimes would get these wild nuts in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and in order to open them I would use the penknife because I didn't have anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">I started doing it with my teeth, but my teeth were hurting badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">I don't think I could have survived without my penknife.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1074">QUESTION:  Is that how you killed the rats?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1075">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1076">QUESTION:  This is difficult to express, isn't it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1077">ANSWER:  Yes, it's difficult for me today to believe that I stooped that low, that I did that, but I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">I'm not proud of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">I feel very humiliated to share this with you, but, yes, I did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1080">QUESTION:  Well, I'm grateful that you told me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1081">ANSWER:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1082">QUESTION:  I know this sounds like a silly question, because you used the word humiliation, you were put in such a horrible situation--
ANSWER:  I never shared these kind of details. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">When I speak at <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and all, I'm very -- not superficial, but I don't go into such details, because I don't feel comfortable talking about it, and I do feel humiliated, but I guess it has to be told and I hope whoever listens will respect me regardless. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">I did that to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And, perhaps, part of my survival, the meaning of my survival, is to talk about it now so people will know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">Again, I feel that my parents have given me such a solid early childhood that I did have the strength to survive and to end up now reasonably well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">I must thank my wonderful husband and son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">They have supported me 150 percent, and I'm not a very easy person to live with, and my husband has been my friend, my nurse, my mother, my father and my lover, and he is a very understanding man, even though he says he could never walk in my shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">He understands my moods. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">He understands my shortcomings, and he puts up with it in a very big way, and I appreciate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">I always say that my marriage is not 50/50, my marriage is 95, I take 95 percent, and I can only give five. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">But, he's a very special man, and my son has been very understanding, and very giving, and very loving, and now I have a grandson and another one on the way, so there are many happy things in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">They don't compensate for my early life, but in a way I have many blessings, and I'm grateful for those.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1094">QUESTION:  You told me that in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there were many actions where they picked people up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1095">ANSWER:  Yes, these round-ups, the actions, we called them Lapanka, and they started early. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">They started, actually, the first one was when they rounded up my father and the other men, before we were herded into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">One action, one such action after my father was taken, took place a few days later, and everybody was at work, the adults and the children 14 and over, and I found myself alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">We were still 1n our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at that point, and I saw, you know, they would come with sirens and all, you know, make a big to do about it, they let you know that they are coming to grab you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And, near our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> there is a magnificent big one, a big <span class="DLF">Christian cemetery</span> , and I ran to that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">It had many <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , and little <span class="BUILDING">chapels</span> , and little mausoleums, and that's where I ended up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">When I came back in 1988 to visit my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , there was an elderly gentleman who told me that he remembered me and he saw me in that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> where I was hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">I did not know that someone saw me and didn't report me, but he told me he saw -- how else would he know where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">He took me to that <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , because it's very close to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and he showed me the little <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> where I was hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">I was hiding there, yes, for several hours.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1105">QUESTION:  So, you were always very quick.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1106">ANSWER:  Yes, you had to be quick on your feet, or else you would not survive, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">But, you know what helped me in a way, I guess, it helped me also I was a tomboy, I was always running, doing things that other young girls, perhaps, were not so eager to do, and I was comfortable with that, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">So, maybe that helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">And, there were other round-ups 1n the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> later on, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">I would say there was one on the average of once a week, once every other week, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1111">QUESTION:  Were you feeling fear all the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1112">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">I still feel it when I talk about it, I still feel fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">And, I don't know, it's also a very - it's a indescribable kind of feeling, because fear is something that you fear people, you fear, you know, emotions, you fear nature, I was fearing fear itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">I was always in fear for everything that was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">I was always -- I was not at ease with anything that was going on in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">But, while we were still in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , while my mother was still there, she was such a -- she was solid as a rock, and she gave us all the comfort that we needed, and that was enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1118">QUESTION:  So, you never saw her cry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1119">ANSWER:  Never saw her cry, never, not when they took my father away, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">She just hugged us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">She took my sister and me close to her and she hugged us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">We cried, she did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">She probably cried that night, but she didn't cry then, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">She took his jacket to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with us, the jacket -- the sports jacket that he was going to put on, because he was always a very formal dresser, you know, and she took it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">She had it in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> with her, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1126">QUESTION:  She was wearing it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1127">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1128">QUESTION:  So, they were very close.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">ANSWER:  Yes, they were very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">They were very close, from what I saw they were very loving, very understanding of one another, and complimenting one another on everything they did and everything they said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And, I mean, I was telling this to some of my friends and they said, ah, I mean, you are idealizing it, there's no such a human being to be so -- I mean, two human beings to be so perfect and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">I said, "My parents and my sister were perfect," and that's the way I remember them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">I don't remember one flaw, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">I can't remember anything that they did that I didn't admire, and I was very, very lucky, very lucky.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1135">QUESTION:  Did you ever pray to God when you were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1136">ANSWER:  I don't know if I prayed to God, but I did pray, but I was also very angry with God, very angry, and I kept saying, "God, if there is a God, why did you let this happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">Why do I have to be all alone now?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And, it was always centering around me, I was very selfish, I guess, in that respect, and I was always referring to myself, selfishly, why did this happen to me, why did I end up like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">I did not -- I don't know, I couldn't see on a larger scope, it was just my own person at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">But, yes, I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1141">QUESTION:  Did anything funny happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1142">ANSWER:  Not funny, but I saw little birds, you know, being hatched, or what do you call it, you know, and it was a miracle of birth and it was beautiful to watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">Nothing funny, but interesting things happened like that, and I watched, and I was fascinated by that, and it gave me strength to go on, because if a bird can survive, I can survive, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And, that was beautiful to watch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">But, funny, no, I don't remember anything funny happening, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1146">QUESTION:  So, laughter was --
ANSWER:  No, I don't remember laughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">I don't remember playing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , except talking about food and pretending, you know, that we were at a banquet, and who 1s going to have the first, you know, piece of the meal, the first part. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">And, it was always centered around food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">Maybe our group was an exception. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">I understand in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> kids were playing, and, you know, with rag dolls and all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">We didn't play, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1153">QUESTION:  You said that when you were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> that you couldn't trust anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1154">ANSWER:  No, how could I trust anybody? </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Everyone I knew betrayed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">It seemed I could not, to this day I cannot understand, people who were our friends, people who were our neighbors, didn't extend a helping hand in our time of need. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">And, I cannot understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">I cannot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">I don't want to refer to it, but in a way <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> nowadays, it's almost a paradox, the Croatian people are the ones who were helping the Germans, and the Serbs were the victims, now the Serbs are trying to take revenge, I guess, in a way to put it very simply, on the Croats. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">But, I was one of the first of our group, the survivors, who wrote letters to anybody and everybody who would only read that we want all these atrocities to stop, because it's like a vicious circle, like a catch-22, enough is enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">But, in the beginning, right after the war, I was very confused. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">I hated with a passion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">I was angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">I think that anger has subsided somewhat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">I try not to hate, because hate is such a wasted energy, and I try to put my life to good use, and I do as much as I feel I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">I'm not working anymore now, so I do try to relate my story in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> as often as I possibly can, but every day I come back from a presentation it's like the wound has been opened anew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And, people tell me, oh, it's so long ago, it shouldn't hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">Every day it hurts the same, and even more, because I remember details that I haven't spoken about before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">But, as I said before, I think I'm trying to learn to forgive, but I can never forget, and I don't want the world to forget, and that is one of my missions, to bear witness, as Elie Weisel says, he was another one of my early inspirations, and I feel that if he can talk about it I have to make myself talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">I'm not as eloquent, and I'm not as smart as he is, but in my own small way I try to do the best I know how, and maybe that's my mission in life and the reason for survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">I don't know.</span></p>
