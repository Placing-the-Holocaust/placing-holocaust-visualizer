<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Why did he leave, did he know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Because in 1938, it was the first political change in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , the Schussnik, you know, there was one --- what was it in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , what happened, how do you call that? </span><span class="sentence" id="46">The Anschluss, thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">With the Anschluss, it was already everybody knew that things will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">My brother had the foresight that he asked our relatives, my mother had a brother in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kingston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">He asked for the affidavit; he got married in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and they came to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">As a matter of fact, I remember the last time when she, my sister-in-law called up -- called up her mother and said goodbye because they are leaving tomorrow for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">At that time, we didn’t, in 1938 you know it was the same story what was with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">They said it could never happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">It was something entirely new in our life. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Who would think what could happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">But when that happened in 1938, my brother left. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">With that it started, the decline in every way — how we felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">There was always even so that we still had our normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">But as the weeks and months went by, more and more it came, the news from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">A little bit here, a little bit there. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">We more and more realizing that we are looking forward for a set time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Can we stay in the pre-war period for a minute? </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Can I ask you about your family, the Jewish aspect of your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="63">How were -- were they religious or assimilated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">ANSWER:  We were conservative. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">We kept every holiday, every significant and insignificant holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We did keep a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We were very much Jewish oriented. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">I had mostly, I would say 90% Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Not -- no gentile boyfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We kept the holidays, we went to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So I would say I had my confirmation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> which I had very nice memories from. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I would say we kept a nice <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">We were not Orthodox but we were radicals already (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="74">What else do you want to know about that aspect? </span><span class="sentence" id="75">In that respect we care. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">I went to Hebrew, I mean it’s not <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> because that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> it was not like here. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">You had to take separate Jewish lessons if you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and that’s what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We had our own group and we had our own <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> where we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We kept socially and in our <span class="DLF">artistic field</span> , we kept up with the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">As the years went by 1938, 1939, more and more we had our own little Zionist groups, you know, and talked a lot about <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Young people got together, but we didn’t realize the real tragedy what was facing us that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  In that case, do you care ---? </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Where were you at this point then, you were in business? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Studying in <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">After I finished my <span class="BUILDING">business school</span> , I got a job with a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">The whole year’s, all the way on --. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">As a matter of fact, all the way until the Germans came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , I was secretary with a lawyer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">QUESTION:  A gentile lawyer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">ANSWER:  All gentiles, but the interesting part of 1t was that towards the end in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> we had -- before they made the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we had to wear the Jewish star. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">The lawyer where I worked was not in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">When I went there, I took my star off so I could cross that <span class="NPIP">part</span> to go to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">That lawyer where I worked was a very, very well known lawyer, not only because he had higher connections; but also he was on in the religious field with nuns and priests. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">He was a very religious man. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">One day as I was working there and somebody rang the bell and I opened the bell and I saw two so-called Hungarian Nazis who were worse sometimes than the Germans were. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I thought well that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">They will take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">But they came and they took my boss because he was in the religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They did not like very religious people either. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They took him to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and I, the secretary, Jewish secretary whom they didn’t know, stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So that was a rather almost humorous aspect of that case. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So I stayed there for a couple of months without him. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">When things got to be very dangerous, then I knew the safe number of that lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">That was right before things got very serious already. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Then I opened up the <span class="INT_SPACE">safe</span> and took out his -- the lawyer’s daughter’s papers, knowing if I have to run away, I will run away with this papers which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Which I used, but that happened later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Do you want to tell me how?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Well, that -- first of all, I have to tell you that we were -- my father and mother were Polish origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">In 1941, when the Germans were not occupying <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> yet, they came out -- they give the order to the Hungarians to deport all the non-Hungarian citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">My father in spite of that, that he was as a Hungarian officer in the Hungarian army and he had the Iron Cross and all that things, when the order came out to deport -- you know there was a time in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and when all the non-Hungarian were deported from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Unfortunately, we were among them and unfortunately we were among them the very first thing when that deportation started, when we didn’t know yet what’s going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">They came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they said, pack your bag, we will take you to your own <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">You will work there and you will survive after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">That was in June, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they said well pack your bag and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">How do you pack your bag when you live there a lifetime? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So we cried and my mother cried and I cried and my fiancé was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So the guy, he was new on the job and he had a certain human caring and sympathy to us said, you know what, I will take your father so I’m sure you stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">You have one day to pack your bag and do whatever you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">That’s what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">In that one day, I had a choice and some people, some relatives told me, you are young, go and hide before they take you. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But my father wrote a letter that the family has to stay together. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Please come and whatever will be, we will survive it together. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So we packed our bag and we went <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We lived in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , four floors. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">All the tenants were looking and saying goodbye to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Some of them cheering, some of them jeering. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">That’s how we were deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I say deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> which is again easy to say but how we were and what happened and how we went there and how we walked or whatever happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">In between a lot of Hungarian, so-called Polish-Hungarian origin got killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamieniec Padolski</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">That was a famous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> where they -- you heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamieniec Podolski</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  So then most of them who got killed there 40,000, they were all Hungarian origin. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">But knowing my parents knew Polish, they all hired a private <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> and we had relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyya</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">We stayed -- we hid back from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> because we knew that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> is going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamieniec Padolski</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">A lot of other people escaped too but we went with that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> and that’s where we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyya</span> , that was that time, yes, more or less normal life because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But of course, after a year being in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and losing people -- it was over 20,000 people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyyja</span> -- by the time I escaped as a smuggler, there was only a couple of hundred left. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">That’s when it was that I said goodbye to my parents and of course, I never saw them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I started on the <span class="DLF">road</span> going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> which was a bad <span class="DLF">road</span> to talk about a lot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Do you ever talk to anyone about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> though, before ---?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we lived, it was a whole year. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">When the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> came, of course, like everybody else, we had to move in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We also had the- they said on the tape that three, four families lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Well, where we went, it was rather five, six families living in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  In one <span class="NPIP">room place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  In a <span class="NPIP">one room place</span> , right. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Then, of course, some of them got killed during the time, so it got less and less. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">That’s when I decided after a year being in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolomyja</span> and about half a year in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , it’s time to go
QUESTION:  Was there anything while you were there that struck you and made a -- that stands out in your mind?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  Every day struck me because I was a young person who was rather careful living and all suddenly you are tossed in this situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">We went to work in the morning because my father being a military person and the Germans also gave him a job as a supervisor. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">The other Jews didn’t like him because he was a supervisor. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They didn’t like nobody who supervised over other Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So we worked there for a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">As a matter of fact, I worked in a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> preparing dinner for German officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">My job was -- with three other girls -- peeling potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">At that time, hunger was already a big aspect of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> life because you know that people just died of hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So what we did, we got permission for the peels to take <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We had the peels for whatever meals we made.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  You cooked them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  We cooked the peels, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">But in order to have something on the peels, we peeled the potatoes in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> thick. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Then we went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we peeled the pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  Oh, I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  We made it so that the peels were thick but then the Germans came to it and they said that whoever will peel like that thick, will have a punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">So we couldn’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">From then on, we had to eat the peels and not peel the peels. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">The other one what I remember from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , when we went out to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Through work, we got to know some other workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">This was German families who moved into <span class="BUILDING">Jewish houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">They renovated and redecorated a little; we worked on it, to keep it clean until their wife and children came. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We saw the mementoes of a life, you know Jewish life, sometimes we came into a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we saw the pots and pans yet as they carried them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We just had to close our eyes and see what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">We had to clean up and make it ready for the German officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I was working there once washing the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> , you know a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Because you’re asking me to tell you memories from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  So the German --. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Until that time, you know, I knew that I was in danger and everything but I didn’t have any personal contact with any physical punishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Cleaning the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and almost finished it, he came in and he took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> and he kicked the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pail</span> and he said this 1s not clean enough, clean it again. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So that was my first encounter with a German officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">As it happened to be, the German officer’s wife came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">She acted rather humanely to the Jewish girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">It happened to be that, I don’t know whether I should mention it, but everything -- but she had some tendencies for liking girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">The question was whether to use this situation to your advantage or not to use it to your advantage. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">But sometimes, it came to a point, you told me an incident before about bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Sometimes you came to a point when the only thing on your mind was, you are twenty years old and somewhere along in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> when you looked up, there is a life yet for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Let’s do whatever is possible but let’s survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It happens to be that that woman helped me a lot to get easier job, to get more food until her husband came to the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Then I lost my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Then we had to go to a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where he worked, some kind of, if I remember correctly, I think something with an ironwork or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">The first day when I went there, we were rather abused that time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Then I decided that this is a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> maybe to run away or something or make connections and that’s what I heard the first time, that there is somewhere a small that it is possible to --. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I stayed in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and I worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">We went out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was always less and less and less. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">My parents were always less and less independent and more and more relied on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">The roles reversed between parents and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Not children because it was only me. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">It was me who directed them what to do and how -- like for instance, when I had to go to work, this mother, the Germans looked up and mother got old very suddenly in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">It happened -- it coincided with her menopause too so that was really a hard thing because she acted sometimes very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">I was very much afraid -- everything fell on her and she just couldn’t digest the tragedy what fell on her. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I sometimes was the one who had to lead her and say it will be good. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">I remember I pinched her cheeks sometimes so she would survive so maybe made a little bit her hair so that the Germans won’t say you are too old to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">This was a couple of memories from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Then, of course there was also memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">I met a young man who worked in a <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">You know when you are twenty years old, no matter what the situation you are thrust into, you always have a little bit romantic state in you. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Because that keeps you alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I met a young man who was very kind to me and he gave me always thick soups and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I sometimes met him but he had somebody else, I had somebody else but it developed some kind of rapport between us. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I remembered him long after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">That was, of course my present husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But I didn’t know at that time yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But when it came to the time that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> got from 20,000 to a couple of hundred, I said that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I discussed it with my mother the last day. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">The last night when I knew that I’m leaving in the morning --. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">You know we rather stayed away from kissing or touching or something because you changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">In order to survive you have to lose your -- certain feelings disappear from you. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">But that was the last night and mother just touched me so because she had her own thoughts and I had my own thoughts. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">The only thing what I remember that I just wanted to -- that nobody should touch me and nobody should kiss me. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Just to push it away because one more touch and one more kiss, I’m not going to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">That was the reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">I never explained it to her but I hope she understood it because one more touch and one more kiss, I’m not going to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">That was the reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I never explained it to her but I hope she understood it. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Because when she wanted to touch me, I just like -- I pushed it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I did it in order that I should be able to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">The next- before I left my father gave me that talisman which I carry with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I never, never leave it. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Wherever I go, that talisman goes with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Somehow, I don’t -- I’m not superstitious otherwise, but I truly believed that talisman saved me from a lot of situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">When the time will be that I have to go, then I have to decide which of my children will have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">That was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> where that time even so that Hitler was far and advancing all over; it was still not the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Only a couple of months later ---.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION:  What year was this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  I was there a whole year in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">From 1941 to 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I have tell you one incident there because that is an -- I try not to go into little details but --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  No, it’s okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  But this detail was so remarkable that I have to mention it. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">After about 25 or 26 days -- the 20" day they caught us. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">I think -- did I mention it or didn’t I mention it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="245">ANSWER:  We were -- oh, I told you that before. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">We were walking at night to reach <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I mean it was a long <span class="DLF">road</span> but I cannot go into every aspect of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But in any case, we were walking at night and sleeping at daytime. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">That was just about the last day before we saw already, the <span class="DLF">Hungarian border</span> when somebody probably who noticed us, told it to the German guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They came up this -- we were ten of us who were escaping from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> -- they came up, the German guards and they shot everybody on sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I ran away that time and it was laying there a big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> eaten up from the moss. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">You know, hollow inside. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">There is a lot of fate was in my life what I have to strongly believe that there must be something, somebody, somewhere who prepared that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> for me there, where I went in that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , in that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hollow tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Was laying and I was laying; I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I just heard the shooting and the crying and saying no, no; until everything got quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I walked out from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> and what I saw only dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I started to walk because I think that time; from that day on I was not quite right. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I think I was singing or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I said, I’m going back to mamma and how wonderful it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I stumbled, by accident, over the smuggler who was also escaping, but not only that he was getting -- he was getting shot and escaping and I found him but everybody had a little knapsack, you know, little knapsack where we had things. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">He, in a big hurry, instead of taking his knapsack, took my knapsack, took my knapsack and I am the one who survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So this little incident what I sometimes wonder how that worked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So I found him but he was injured and he said he cannot do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">He gave me his pocketknife and in his tie, he was --. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The trouble as they shot, they shot at my back and it went into his tie, near the genital areas. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">He gave me that little knife and he said that I have to take that bullet out which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">He was there for the night and then he said, write me that letter that you are here so that I can get my money. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I won’t get too much in any case because from the ten of you, you are the only one survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So that’s what the paper what I showed you that I wrote him and that was from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">This was the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hungarian woods</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korosmezo</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  Could you spell that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korosmezo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Here I write it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="274"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kirsh</span> -- this is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korosmezo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="276">This is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">From there, when I am in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korosmezo</span> , I am already in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So he said that, he covered me over with leaves and he said I don’t feel good. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So he left me with my knapsack what I had a little sweater on. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">It was cold in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">He said -- he gave me an onion, by the way, which was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">He went away and he said he will come for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">He will whistle a certain way so I know because that was, even so it was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , but people could still go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">He said when you hear that whistle, then tell that this is you. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So he went away and he left me there four and a half -- four days and one night. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> by myself so I was really -- can you imagine that, a twenty- year old girl in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , you know, rain or not rain or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">There was one incident that something moved, I probably moved and the peasant came there who was taking lambs to eat, to raise or whatever you call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">He heard and he comes straight -- he came straight where I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I was just huddling there covered with certain leaves there and I heard the <span class="DLF">steps</span> closer and closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">The only thing what he did, he peed and peed on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">I was just standing there and that was one of the incidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Then people asked me what did you eat for four days? </span><span class="sentence" id="293">You have to eat for four days, which is not necessarily so. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">But I had that one onion and then blueberries grew that time in the --. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">When I felt safe enough in the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I went around me and I ate some blueberries. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">But the fourth night, I dreamed about my fiancé in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">It was a beautiful wedding and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">When I got up and I was in the situation, you know, whatever I was in there; I looked up, I said this is sh . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Ican’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">There was a limit what I could endure. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">And I said, I just don’t care anymore, nothing, when I heard the whistle. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So little coincidences and he did come. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I told him where were you? </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I couldn’t talk so good to him because he didn’t talk Hungarian and I didn’t talk so good Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">But he said, he was sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I mean, I believe it, I’m not such a good surgeon. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">He came for me the fifth day and he took me to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I had to walk up on the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Because I was -- even so I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> -- I think my husband explained it. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">When they catch you there, then they immediately send you back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So everybody was afraid to give -- to hide you. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So I was up there in the -- in some kind of an <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> waiting for further instruction to go deeper into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="313">The deeper you got into <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , the safer you were that the Germans -- that they won’t give you over to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">This was in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">As I was walking down the <span class="DLF">steps</span> because he told me to come down now we are ready, we have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and we will go to the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mag</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">As I walked down, I saw a figure in the bottom of the <span class="DLF">steps</span> and I didn’t recognize quite and he probably didn’t recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But when I wrote that letter, you know, what I gave; my fiance, he himself came all the way to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border town</span> , to bring the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and that was him standing downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I don’t go into the feelings and sentimental aspects with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">I leave that to your imagination.. But it was something to behold. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">His life was, of course, at that time in danger because if they would catch him, he would also be -- so he was a Hungarian citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">But what I wanted to tell you, what I don’t want to leave out. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">As we wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mar __</span> to get with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mar</span> | again, you’re already out. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">In <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> you can go with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , whatever you want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Until that time, you were in danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">It was a long row of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> before the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">When you passed the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , you were already in -- on my <span class="NPIP">destination</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">There was a long <span class="DLF">line</span> of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">At the beginning of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , the chauffeur looked out, the one that was paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">He said, we are in trouble because they re checking the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , my first instinct was to jump out because if they see me, the way I look from this life. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I was full with lice by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">My head was full with lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">I was dirty ,I was bleeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">I had wounds, I had all kind of things there from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">If they catch him, he will pay with his life for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">So I wanted to jump out from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and if that’s the way, it has to be .He was holding me back and all suddenly a soldier comes to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Mind you, there was a long <span class="DLF">line</span> of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> there before us, crossing the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">He doesn’t even look in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">It was such a remarkable incident that I will never forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">He doesn’t look in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">He just goes to the chauffeur and he says, you know, I lost my key. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">I can’t even remember what he said -- license or my key or if he said something to the chauffeur -- would you please drive me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Korosmezo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">The chauffeur said, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">He came in and sat next to the chauffeur. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">As we walked by, you know the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , and as we reached the point where the guy checked everybody’s card, they just looked in and saw a Hungarian officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">They just saluted and we went by. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">To this day, number one, I don’t forget the incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Number two, I don’t believe in supernatural, I cannot quite believe it but there is a tiny little doubt in my mind whether this was not some kind of an angel set down. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Because why would -- I mean it is a coincidence to be mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="349">QUESTION:  Oh, yes, indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">You had mentioned earlier when we were talking that you had some type of an encounter with Wallenberg?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">ANSWER:  Yes, that was -- that came later. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Because when -- then I came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">In <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> as I said at that time was, I was from 1941 to 1942 in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">At that time <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> still didn’t occupy <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355">It wasn’t ghetto yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">It was my aunt there and she asked me what it was like and what she didn’t believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I ate potato peels and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">But as we closed into the year, more and more Germans came to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> until finally on the main <span class="DLF">street</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , the Germans marched in and that was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="359"><span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was occupied by <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">You know Horthy, Horthy was the ---. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So he went away with his white horse and stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">He tried, as a matter of fact, to save the Jews but he was too weak to do anything in that respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">Then the Germans came in and then, of course, the Germans took over like they took over the other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Then came the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Knowing what the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> is because I had a little bit of experience before, so I said I am not going to go in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">As I said, I worked with a lawyer and I had this papers from this lawyer’s daughter what I stole from the <span class="INT_SPACE">safe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">I said I’m not and my aunt said, well come with us and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">She said, by the way, that time she said, now I know what you told me, what went on in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I can believe it now more. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">As the year went by, she believed me unfortunately more and more. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">She was a very lovely lady, very nice aunt what I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">They all went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I went with the Catholic papers, you know where the <span class="BUILDING">Balaton</span> 1s?</span></p>

You see everybody had a blanket or a quilt or we called it different from a quilt --. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">In that moment when they took them out, I thought -- you see at that time I escaped from so many things already that I had a little bit of experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I was far from that naive already what I was before. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I said to the guy who was standing beside me, I said, look, this people, these Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">I used the word -- they had a very nice blanket and I don’t have one, can I have it? </span><span class="sentence" id="501">It startled the guy who checked my papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Before I even gave him my papers, the other guy said, you don’t have to check her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">She will have the new blanket from the Jew and I will check her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">He didn’t even have my papers in his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Because my papers was even so I had it with me and they were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">I was a prostitute according to my papers, that kind of papers I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">I certainly acted sometimes accordingly. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">That’s another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">In any case, they went away and they took them out and they shot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">Now I have to interject here now, a scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">This people whom they shot before the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , she had a brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">After the war, when we were still in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the brother came to pick up whatever they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Then they said, I heard that there was somebody here, some shiksa here, who took away my dead brother’s <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">They shot before the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the . </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I want to confront that woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I was still, because at that time was still, you know not safe to go out but even so that the Russians took already over, the Germans sometimes came back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So it was not safe yet to give yourself away. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I never did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Some people did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">They gave themselves away and then the Germans came back, that was the end of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I never -- I still didn’t because I knew that they come -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> is two part, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> was the Germans, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pest</span> was the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">They went back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">It took two, three weeks until finally the Russians took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So he wanted to confront me that who is that who took her -- and to tell me certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">When he came there and was confronted me, it was even so that time that the Russians were there already, I was still afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I said just don’t make too much commotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">I did that to save my life, I’m Jewish too. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">We talked there sometimes and he said well, in that case, I understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">That was the after effect of that case. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">In any case, we were there in that shelter all the way until January 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">In the night, one Russian but comes down. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">You see, I talk about the Russians so much because the Russians are the ones who liberated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Not the Russians, I’m not here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  This is 1945 already?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">ANSWER:  This is 1945, January 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">So my war lasted from 1941 to 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">So I was 4 4 years younger wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">When the first Russians came in and mind you, I was still with Catholic papers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">When the first Russians came in somehow, you know, in any case that day’s already with the bombardment, is catching these parents and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I am quite sure that I was mentally really not right and understandably so. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I was really, really on the end of my <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="542">I couldn’t take too much more anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">When I saw the first Russian, I just -- I said there is other people around. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Wherever we were living in the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> , that was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> , of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Half of it was bombed and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">I wanted to run to that Russian and kiss him from top to toe. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I’m free, I’m free -- you know, the movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">They were holding me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">They said don’t you know what the Russians are doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="550">They did a lot of raping, you know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">They didn’t care whether they rape 18 year old or 88 years old, they didn’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">But the difference it was, that the first fighting group who fights for a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> 1s always the elite of the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">They do not do any raping. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">They are not the ones who does it. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">The occupying troops are the ones who does it. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">When all kind when it was free, free robbery, free raping, free --. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">You could do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">But the first elite group didn’t do too much raping. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">But I wanted to go out and then the girl next to me, she said, what are you so happy about? </span><span class="sentence" id="560">To see the Russians, what you know, she started because she didn’t really know who I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">She just knew how my name ts just Komaria. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">He was holding me back and I didn’t go. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">But the second day, because then they came more and more Russians in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> looking for men, you know, who was hiding also. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">That young man who stood beside me and he said, he told, that was, you know up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> it was a <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">They had in the <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> , they had honey left. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Food was a big thing that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">He comes to me and he says before yet, the Russians came, you know what; there’s big, big container of honey there. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">We will go up there and I will give you a lot of honey. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Honey was gold at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">That was already after that incident with the Germans so I said now I don’t need him any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">He said, you know what, I will give you the honey, I saved your life but --- he knew already that the Russians are in the corner but when it comes to it, will you save mine? </span><span class="sentence" id="572">How can I save you?, </span><span class="sentence" id="573">I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">You know how you can save it. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">So he knew who I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Because he wouldn’t ask me that question then whether I can save your life or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">When the Russians came in, when they were already looking for Hungarian soldiers, or non- Jews, you know, he came to me and he said, help me to get out of here. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">I helped you, you help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And I did help him to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Whether I did it right or wrong, but I did it and he did escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I don’t know what happened to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Well, in any case, then the Russians came in and then of course, it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I don’t know whether you know about the aspects of how the Russians behaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">It was <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchens</span> again and it was again standing in the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">It was all the ruins and I had nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I just walked on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Sawing people coming out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Everybody says, oh Yaneka, ; ; , and I went there and I had nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">Because everybody died. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I said well, I will look for my aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">You know that aunt who didn’t believe me? </span><span class="sentence" id="592">They were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they were the rich aunts in the family because they had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">That was like having a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">They had some six, seven <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">That was an awful lot of <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">Here, you know people who works can have four <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> too, it’s nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">In any case, they did survive and I did go to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">It’s nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">In any case, they did survive and I did go to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">It was a big beautiful reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">Of course they took away their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , they took away their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and they gave them the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where the maid used to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">There, where the maid used to live, there I was living for them, for a while until they got another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> attached to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">They took back their old <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , not the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , just a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , because the Russians of course wouldn’t give them back the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">What was life, you will ask me after the bombardment? </span><span class="sentence" id="605">After the Russians came in? </span><span class="sentence" id="606">it was a tough life. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">It was first of all, the first days were -- the first week rather after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">It was also interesting -- you know we lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> when we didn’t go to the <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">After the so-called fighting, I went up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> and looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> because I was more or less like free then. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">Because after five years, you felt that Mommy I survived! </span><span class="sentence" id="611">I was rather careless that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">I went and I looked out the <span class="DLF">window</span> because I wanted to see what is a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">You see this is not a war like here. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">They drop an atomic bomb and everybody’s boom! </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">There they are fighting corner to corner. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I went up on the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I looked down and I saw this one is Germans and this one is Russians, they’re shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">I look out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> so they shot up. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">They almost shot my head off. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">So I got -- well because I didn’t know better. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So I went back to there until things subsided. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">At that time, <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were closed yet and Russians were standing all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">Slowly, slowly life got back to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">Everything, you couldn’t buy nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">As I said, I was secretary for a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I had to make something, money didn’t mean anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I had nothing anymore to sell. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">The only thing it is to work and get food for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">The lawyer where I worked, whom I worked before once, he took me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Some people came to him, advise us and they gave him eggs and bread or pork fat or whatever they gave him, he gave me part of it as payment to the secretary. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Until things didn’t get back to more or less, I couldn’t call it normal because it was far from normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I met one day a friend of our father and mother who did survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Her family didn’t survive but her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">She lived in a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and her <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> got a full hit from the bomb and it had a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">So I lived in the little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> but in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="636">She was very attached to me because I was young and I walked -- you see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> has many, many beautiful <span class="DLF">bridges</span> which were all bombed, all the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">People went through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buda</span> to get potatoes, flowers or--. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Sometimes I brought it back so she was attached to me because she knew that being young, I will bring something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">By the way, that time, there was another incident what maybe I will tell you, certain main, main aspects of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">It was a couple of days after the -- after things settled down -- there was a so-called free, free looting. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">People went with big bags in this big <span class="BUILDING">department stores</span> and whatever they found they put it in the bag and they took it <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="642">It was free loot. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">The Russians stood there and told you so take it, take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">If you went out empty handed, they send you back to take something. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">So I’m living there in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where above it was a <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="646">In this <span class="BUILDING">department store</span> , I thought I will go looting too. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Why not, the other people go, but I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I didn’t prepare myself with the proper thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I didn’t have a bag, I didn’t have a knife, I didn’t have the scissors so I was not quite made for this looting business. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">There was big giant men there carting materials and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">I was just there. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">If they make me , I was some 85 or 90 pounds, if they gave me a push, I would just fall down. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">They said if you want to live, you better go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I want to loot so I went down where the food was. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">There in the food, people went also and took the silverware and whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Finally, one guy lifted me up and put me on a bag of flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">He said you stay here if you want to be alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Because they were strong people and I was just a -- the wind could blow me away that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I was still there, people took everything and I stood there with -- on the bag of flour until everything was looted out. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I stood there with the bag of flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Of course,, I couldn’t take the bag of flour and that was full with pickles and jams and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">On me, but I still was sitting on a bag of flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">What did I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I had one and only dress and I took the flour and I put it in my -- here like this, in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I went all the way walked that way to my landlady and I said, here we have flour, we make bread from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Which we took out the glass and we did make bread from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">But after a while, it was got to -- I lived that time, I went away from my aunt and I lived in a friend’s of mine, the same friend who was together with me in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I went to that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">You know there was, they call it, belated reaction. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">When you know you survived, when you know well, five years went away, you survived alone but you survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Then after that when you know that it comes, that psychological for what? </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And for whom? </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And for why? </span><span class="sentence" id="674">That was on <span class="INT_SPACE">fourth floor</span> where I lived that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">It was in December. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">I was just alone, just --. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">I said, I --I came to the point that I needed help which I personally didn’t get -- psychological help. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">So I opened the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I went to the <span class="DLF">windowsill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I thought, well, many people did that by the way, I was not the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I said well, let’s finish it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">My landlady, who was a very nice lady, she came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and she says Elizabeth, you must be crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">You are opening the <span class="DLF">window</span> and the whole heat what I put up here, it goes away. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I mean I don’t heat here that you open here the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I am standing on the <span class="DLF">window ledge</span> jumping. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I got very mad and I went then. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">I got so mad that I went to her and I start to hit her. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I hit her and I hit her and she kneeled down beside me and she said, oh, Elizabeth don’t do that, don’t do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">She did that and she said that just to bring me back from the <span class="DLF">ledge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Was a nice lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">After that, I said well, okay, let’s start living. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> and I asked for a job in the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">In there, there are so many incidents, so many incidents happened there during the war, after the war, during the bombing, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">It is interesting but as I told it to Henry, you cannot go into every <span class="NPIP">aspect</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="694">QUESTION:  Well, okay, you can tell any ones you want, that you would like to --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">ANSWER:  But that is what is really standing out, I told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">One day when I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my landlady, I met --. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">You see, I was working with the lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">In that <span class="BUILDING">law office</span> , I met a young Jewish man who also survived the war and who met me in that <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">He went not for soups because he was at that time in the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> business. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">He started to me -- at that time people only made money because there was no business, nothing, it was only <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> He started the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> business very successfully. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">He always had an eye on me but I was not too interested. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">But after the war, when he gave me a proposition, he said you know what, I mean what is that, you work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">soup kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">I have money, you will come and live with me and we will see what we will do. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I probably would have become what papers I had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I said okay and I went to my landlady and I had, as I said, one dress which I washed was full with flours. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I said to her, I have a date with that man and he was standing down with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I lived on the <span class="INT_SPACE">second floor</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I told it to my landlady, he’s waiting and my landlady said okay because she wanted something from him too. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I opened the <span class="DLF">window</span> and I said I coming down five minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">Ad I said, I had one dress and I went down to go on a <span class="DLF">road</span> what could end like Madame X or who knows what. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">I don’t know what would have become. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">But as I walked down the <span class="DLF">steps</span> going to the guy who’s waiting for me in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> before the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , a Russian soldier comes up the <span class="DLF">steps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I see a Russian soldier, I run because I had incidents with a Russian soldier which I didn’t tell you, which I wrote if you are interested.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">QUESTION:  Oh, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">ANSWER:  A jar of pickles where the -- you know the Russians did their -- plenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">So when I saw a Russian, I run. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">This was my experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">The Russian guy tells me, well Elizabeth, don’t you recognize me? </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I didn’t recognize him because he wore the party’s uniform, the red star, that was Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">So then I looked at him and then I saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I went back with him to my landlady. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">My landlady opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and said are you crazy bringing a Russian here? </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I said, he’s not a Russian, he’s not a Russian, he’s Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I know him from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Then she said, but he’s waiting downstairs with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and I said -- but you know it’s interesting and I don’t want to be sentimental about it and we are old enough not to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">But five years I fought for my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">In a minute, he came into my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I said well, that’s it for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Now take over -- and he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">That was how we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">Now what do you ask me now? </span><span class="sentence" id="732">What do you want to know more?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">QUESTION:  I think that should possibly do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I think I’ve --.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">ANSWER:  And then of course we waited and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , we went to the <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">The <span class="BUILDING">consulate</span> said the quota is closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Then all suddenly my brother kept sending me affidavits and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Meanwhile I got pregnant too. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">We thought we settle down in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> like many other Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">But then one day there comes -- he writes me a letter, the Polish quota is open. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Let’s go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">QUESTION:  You mentioned something about a trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">That was just to visit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  The trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was before when we knew already that we come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and we had brothers that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , so we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">As a matter of fact, Barbara, our daughter, the first move what she made was in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">That was the trip before we go. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">One thing, I want to tell you more. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">As a -- in the tape -- because that was also a nice incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">On what we came is the Mauretania. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">When you are nearing the Statue of Liberty, the captain, especially at that time-. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">By the way, we were one of the last who didn’t go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Before us they still went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">When we came, it was not <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ellis Island</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So there was two incidents what I want to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">So then we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and we were nearing the Statue of Liberty and the captain of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was reading there, you know, Give me your tired, your poor, and we were standing, Henry and I and he had his story to tell and I had my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I was pregnant and we went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and we were holding hands and we were looking at the Statue of Liberty. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And I said, well, we made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">That’s the end of the story. </span>
