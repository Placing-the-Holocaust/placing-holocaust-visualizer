<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  The date is June 2, 1992. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">We’re speaking with Mr. Philip Goldstein. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Mr. Goldstein, could you please tell me your name and what you were called during the war, your date of birth, your place of birth and then anything you possibly can about your childhood, growing up in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I am Philip Goldstein, formerly Fishel Goldstein, born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> on January 12, 1922. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I was the youngest of five children, four brothers and one sister, born to a family of artisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">My father was a custom tailor, his brother was a furrier, his father, uncles and cousins were furriers. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I started <span class="BUILDING">parochial school</span> when I was about three years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">While accompanying my mother, who took lunch to my brothers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cheder</span> , I didn’t want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and that’s how my parochial education started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION:  Would that be a yeshiva?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER:  No, no .A <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">At the age of about six or seven, I entered a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish secular school</span> which had a double curriculum, a complete Polish curriculum plus a Judaic curriculum of Hebrew, Yiddish, the Pentateuch, Rashi, Jewish history and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I was there up to the age of ten when I entered a <span class="BUILDING">Polish public school</span> for Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I graduated at fourteen, which was the end of compulsory education under the Polish school system. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">At that age I started to work as an apprentice in my father’s <span class="BUILDING">tailor shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My heart was not in it, for I would rather spend my time reading books, and I did spend a lot of time reading in the beautiful <span class="DLF">park</span> we had in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My sister had her own dressmaking shop and my oldest brother worked for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">My father also employed a journeyman in addition to myself as an apprentice. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The next brother was a printer; he was an active member and leader in the Zionist movement, Hashomer Hatzair, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">At the age of 20, he left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kibbutz Hachshara</span> , which was the preparation for kibbutz life in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Was your father religious though?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  The parents were religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">My mother was very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">My father was religious in the sense that he prayed every day and went to Sabbath services at his congregation and so on, but that was the extent of his religious practices. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">He was observant; the children were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We were all secularly inclined. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">However, we followed our father to services on high holidays, and I did carry his tallith to the 1 https://collections.ushmm.org congregation every Saturday until I was about 12 years or 13. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">That was about the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">After my Bar Mitzvah, my religious education came to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Well, you had a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">You hardly found any <span class="BUILDING">Jewish homes</span> that weren’t kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">That was part of a way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">We never ate out. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Even though our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was fairly sizeable for <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , having about 100,000 people, and a varied industrial base, nevertheless, the idea of eating out was not a way of life as we knew it in the West. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I left my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> at the age of 20 when I was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and up to that time I had never eaten out in a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">We had eaten out at parties, at other <span class="BUILDING">people’s homes</span> , but never at a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">My next brother was employed in a <span class="BUILDING">commercial establishment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">He was the only one who, at the end of 1939, escaped to the eastern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , which was occupied by the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My mother was the oldest in a family of eight children and my father was the second in <span class="DLF">line</span> in a family of six children. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">All together, our family consisted of, in addition to our own <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , of eleven <span class="BUILDING">households</span> , with eleven uncles and aunts, their respective spouses and with 25 first cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">One of my mother’s brothers lived in the U.S.A. since the 1920’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Of the entire family in Europe, only three first cousins survived, and all three came from the same <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Of the remaining ten <span class="BUILDING">households</span> , not a trace was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">From our own <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , in addition to myself, my brother, who spent most of the war years in the <span class="BUILDING">gulag</span> , in the Artic, returned after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">He lives in Europe now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  What did you do -- did you have any other interests? </span><span class="sentence" id="46">You were involved in the Zionist movement? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Did you have any hobbies?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">My brother was one of the leaders in the Zionist youth movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I joined this group when I was about ten years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">My chief hobby, from very early on, was reading. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We had a very extensive <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , the second largest in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which was a part of our organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">It was called the I.L. Peretz Library and I exchanged books there every time that the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> was open, which was three or four times a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I stayed up reading to the early hours and used a kerosene lamp or candle instead of the ceiling light so as not to disturb my two brothers who slept in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Were these mostly Yiddish books?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  No, mostly Polish, some were Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I preferred reading in Polish, but I was articulate in Yiddish as well; however, there weren’t as many Yiddish books to choose from. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We read mostly Polish, but our spoken language was mostly Yiddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Yiddish was a living medium then, and not the linguistic curiosity to which it has been reduced in our day. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">2 https://collections.ushmm.org
QUESTION:  Would it be Polish literature or other literature in translation or Jewish books in translation or what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  Well, you could get everything you wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I read mostly Polish translations of French, German, Russian and American literature, as well as some Polish and Yiddish works in the original. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">In 1939, at the outbreak of the war, my older brother, Moshe, was mobilized. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Since he had served in the Polish army and was released in March of 1939, he was subject to the general mobilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">He reported to his regiment and was lucky that he didn’t become a POW. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">He was able to escape capture as a POW and return <span class="BUILDING">home</span> six weeks after he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Of course, we didn’t know what had happened to him throughout this period. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Subsequently, he had become a very active member in the underground Hashomer Hatzair movement in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> , and our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> became the contact place for couriers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moscow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Polish ladies, as well as members of the Hashomer Hatzair leadership in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , came. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Mordecai Anielewicz, the leader of the uprising in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> , who perished in 1943, was our guest during the first and second Passover seder in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">He stayed in a <span class="BUILDING">furnished room establishment</span> in our <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> during a mission to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> , having traveled on Polish papers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">He didn’t look Jewish and had no trouble traveling on Polish papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">While in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , I didn’t know who was in the leadership of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Even those rounded up from the ruins of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> , who came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz-Birkenau</span> via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> in the early summer of 1943, had no idea of who was in the leadership. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">It was only after the war when I came across a monograph about the uprising, and recognized Anielewicz from the picture on the front page, that I found out about his role. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">There were other people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> who came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> who were involved in the first armed action in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> in January 1943, Josef Kaplan among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">My brother, Moshe was taken in the early morning hours of the 28" of April 1942 and executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">I was in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">My entire family was put under house arrest and I had to surrender. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">By the delayed action of this process, I escaped a bullet in the neck. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I was taken to <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the security service and put into a large <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> that was full of Jews from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> who had been there since the early morning hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">We were shipped out the next morning, April 29, 1942, and arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> past midnight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  What went on between ’39 and ’42? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">What were you doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Were you still working or ---?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I was the youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Every able-bodied Jewish male from the age of 16 to 60, had to work at least one day on assigned places of work that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , and later on the ghetto community government, administered. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">They had to send out forced laborers so to speak, to various posts that the Germans had designated; military posts, and a variety of other assignments,, doing all sorts of 3 https://collections.ushmm.org work -- unloading, loading, <span class="DLF">digging ditches</span> , you name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">There was hardly any kind of work that we weren’t assigned to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Being the youngest, I took the place of my father as well as of my older brother, so I would end up working almost two or three days a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I didn’t mind, I’d rather do it than have my father, who was in his mid-to-late fifties and ill, do hard labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">My oldest brother had to help my father so I took his <span class="NPIP">place</span> as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">In 1940, that is August of 1940, almost all able-bodied young Jewish males received orders to report for shipment to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camps</span> on the German-Soviet border in the district of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> to dig anti-tank fortifications. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I was the only one in the family who was caught in the net. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">It turned out that if you didn’t report, you simply didn’t go; they didn’t come after you. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">But if you did report, you were trapped. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Several hundred of us left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> , perhaps four or five hundred men. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Altogether there were thousands of young Jewish men from various parts of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> congregated in several <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">forced labor camps</span> stretched along a section of <span class="REGION">frontier land</span> that ran between two <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rivers</span> , the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Bug</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">San</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cieszanow</span> , where we dug anti-tank fortifications along a given section of <span class="DLF">frontier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">That was my introduction to forced labor under SS rule. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">We left dead inmates at the <span class="DLF">work site</span> every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They were simply shot at random and buried in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and covered up with moss, so that one couldn’t even find their <span class="DLF">graves</span> , for there were no markers left. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">This went on until about the end of October when suddenly we were marched out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cieszanow</span> and taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> , from where, by rail, we were transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krasnik</span> , in the District of Lublin. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We spent the whole night in a <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> where the Jewish community’s council was located. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I will never forget the kindness of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ’s Jewish people who practically showered us with food and drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">In the afternoon we were marched out, under guard, to the town of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Annapol</span> and handed over to a German private firm to build <span class="DLF">highways</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">We were not under any military supervision, but just worked as civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">We discovered soon that if you go away and don’t come back, you’re not missed, Several of us decided to start on our way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We sold whatever clothes we could spare in order to get a few zlotys for food and passage money for the trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We marched 16 kilometers that morning and crossed a guarded <span class="DLF">bridge</span> that spanned the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula River</span> , and within two hours were in the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We spent the rest of that day going from small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , riding in horse-drawn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> belonging to Jews engaged in either transporting people or goods. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">After darkness, we found ourselves as “passengers” on such a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , sharing the <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> with a load of grain that the owner smuggled into the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> , traveling through <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Not only were we in violation of the after-darkness curfew, but also sitting on “contraband”. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Had we been stopped, 1t would have meant the end of us all. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> the next morning after an absence of two and a half months. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">That was my introduction to camp life, and in a way it helped me later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">When I arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , unlike many others, I was not totally surprised by what awaited us, even although the level of raw brutality in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz-Birkenau</span> was uniquely evil. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">In retrospect, from what I have learned in the past century, I can state without hesitation, that in the entire universe of evil that was Nazi-occupied Europe, there was no place that could match the hell of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> in it’s first year of existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">We walked the three kilometers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> on 4 https://collections.ushmm.org May 1, 1942, and there were one thousand young and middle- aged men in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Within one month most of them were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">By the end of about two months, most of those still alive were the ones who survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp --</span> there were fifteen of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Allow me to track back a bit in time -- I have a reason for doing so. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">In early 1942 I came down with typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">There were many typhus cases in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Normally typhus is survivable by young, healthy people, even without any medical help as long as there is water to drink, because one can’t eat anyway in a State of very high fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I had developed some complications and hemorrhaged all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> under strict curfew conditions and had no access to doctors or <span class="BUILDING">drugstores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">My brother risked his life to go outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to an <span class="BUILDING">apothecary</span> in order to get some medication, which turned out to be the wrong one, and it nearly poisoned me. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">The doctor who attended me was sick and he didn’t know the seriousness of the problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">My brother, together with one of our neighbors, searched for a doctor half the night until they found one. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">He realized that I was in a bad way for it was the third or fourth case in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that winter of typhus with such complications, and no one survived the hemorrhaging. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">He plainly said, “There’s nothing I can do, if you have some cognac, give it to him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="134">He thought I was out of it, but I was still conscious and I remember the stupidity of his suggestion. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">This was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in 1942 and he expected us to have, or be able to get, cognac in the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">In the morning my doctor came and ordered a transfusion but there was no way to find a donor who had my blood type. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I was supposed to be taken to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for the procedure, but luckily someone decided that I couldn’t possibly survive the trip, since it was a very cold winter day, and my blood pressure was extremely low. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Instead, the <span class="BUILDING">ghetto hospital</span> sent a surgeon, accompanied by a laboratory technician who used some hand held dish for typing the blood of several volunteers, including my brother Moshe. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I remember the technician telling the surgeon that none of the blood tested matched mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Nevertheless the surgeon decided to use my brother’s blood for there was no time to lose and he told my parents that the risk must be accepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Transfusions were given directly from donor to recipient via some tube contraption connecting their veins. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">My parents were standing over my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> knowing very well that any moment now, should my body reject the donor’s blood, their youngest son will be dead within minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The doctor kept asking me, how I felt and I said, I feel warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">That’s a good sign, he responded. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">He finished the transfusion and I was saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">He came back eight days later to take out the stitches and he couldn’t believe his own eyes that I was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I still have the marks of those stitches on the inside of my right arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">He suggested that I come to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> after I get well to be examined thoroughly t find out how I managed to survive that ordeal. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It was the same brother whose blood saved me, who was shot dead two months later, when I was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">As it turned out, had I not had typhus at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and developed immunity, there would have been no chance in the world for me to have survived <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> in 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">QUESTION:  Can we ask a question, Susan did ----. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">5 https://collections.ushmm.org (S.B.) Did you ever consider escaping rather than returning to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , after you had been in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  When we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , 1.e., </span><span class="sentence" id="154">in the fall of 1940, there were no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> yet in most of the General Government of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> there were formed in the spring of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Except, of course, for the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed in early 1940, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> was incorporated into the Reich, (1.e. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and the entire province) and the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was formed in October or November of 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">Yes, it was a good question. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Some people escaped, it was not too difficult to escape across the <span class="DLF">border</span> which consisted of a simple barbed wire which wasn’t electrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Of course, if an inmate was caught before he reached the no-man’s land he would be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">On the way to work, at some points, we almost brushed against the <span class="DLF">barbed wire fences</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We saw the Soviet guards patrolling. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Some officers came close to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> and talked to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">I remember there was one officer who spoke Yiddish to us He was a Soviet Jewish captain. </span><span class="sentence"

id="167">Once you escaped across the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , you had to cross a stretch of no-man’s land of perhaps 50 feet of terrain to reach the <span class="DLF">Soviet fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">In most instances, the German guards couldn’t see, when one forced the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , either by crawling under it, or by spreading the strands

running through the neutral no-man’s land. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Since the guards couldn’t shoot at them, they fired rounds in the <span class="DLF">air</span> , thereby alerting the

in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> an the annihilation of the Jewish population there began in the summer of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">In some <span class="REGION">areas</span>

<p><span class="sentence" id="206">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">A couple of weeks after we arrived, some strong people

<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  In early 1943, there were two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sick bays</span> in the old camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , in addition to the main <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> to which Jewish prisoners had no access. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Of the former two, 9 https://collections.ushmm.org one was <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> no. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">7, which I described above, and the other was <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> no. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">8 which admitted some Jewish prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">To get me there required a little influence in the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Although my cousin was surgeon there, he couldn’t simply admit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I had to be assigned there by the camp’s <span class="BUILDING">administrative office</span> , and that’s where his connections helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Patients there weren’t subject t regular selections to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and usually stayed there until pronounced fit to return to the regular <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">He succeeded 1n treating me for my infection, and after three weeks, I got my first shave, but my face was still full of scarred tissue. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">It took more than two years before the scar tissue completely disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">A few days after transferring out of the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> , the old camp for men in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> was evacuated and it became part of the enlarged female camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">The men moved to one of the newly finished wooden <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">barracks camps</span> , called “D Lager” or Camp D. That happened in June of 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">For the next nine months or so, I went from work detail to work detail, including work inside the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , until in April 1944, I was recruited to work in the “Sauna” -- the more correct designation being disinfection facility, where civilians were transformed into prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I worked there from April of 1944 until November when the size of the crew operating the <span class="BUILDING">facility</span> was drastically reduced and the surplus sent back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp D.</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> was no longer the destination of incoming transports nor of prisoners transferred from other camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">The last victims of its killing machine were transports from <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt Ghetto</span> , in addition to Birkenau inmates whose fate was sealed by the last mass selections that took place in the fall of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">The “sauna” facility abutted the rod leading from the <span class="DLF">railroad ramp</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium complex</span> no. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">3 and 4, and we had the unfortunate and heart rending experience of being witness to daily processions of thousands upon thousands of men, women and children marching past us to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">The marching columns were no more than about 200 yards from their destination, but what 1s still etched in my memory is that the faces of the about-to-be murdered people betrayed only fatigue, perhaps confusion, but no comprehension of their imminent doom. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Between April and the end of summer, several hundred thousand Hungarian Jews plus countless others from various parts of Europe, walked this stretch of <span class="DLF">road</span> without realizing that it is their last walk.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">QUESTION:  Are there any things specific, incidents or episodes that you remember from this period?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">ANSWER:  I remember far too many episodes but I cannot think of any specific one which would, or should, take precedence over all others, hence, the choice is difficult, especially in an extemporaneous setting. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">We could sit here for days and tape without a stop, and not exhaust the reservoir of my recollections of this period, let alone the well of accumulated experiences of my three year sojourn in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">By way of concession to your inquiry, allow me to add the following: what has burdened my memory foremost, and is forever etched in my consciousness, despite the lapse of nearly half a century, I the daily procession of thousands of 10 https://collections.ushmm.org people, marching past the “sauna” on their way to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , and the sight of smoke coming out of the <span class="DLF">crematoria chimneys</span> shortly afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">However, one occurrence which has since become grist for the <span class="BUILDING">mills</span> of Holocaust researchers, namely the uprising of the Birkenau Sonderkomando (crematoria crews) in October of 1944, took place within a stone’s throw of the “sauna” facility and I would like to register my recollection of the event within the framework of this interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="316">QUESTION:  Was that Greek, was that run by the Greeks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="317">ANSWER:  No! </span><span class="sentence" id="318">To my knowledge there were no Greek Jews among them, or at most, very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">The old guard, 1.e., </span><span class="sentence" id="320">the cadres consisted mainly of Polish Jews, plus some French Jews and others. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">During the

liquidation took place in November 1943 when a part of the Sonderkomando was transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majdanek</span> , allegedly for work in the <span

<p><span class="sentence" id="385">QUESTION:  Okay and I missed all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">You were telling me about the cement bags and all that ,
ANSWER:  In April, the so-called winter issue of clothing had to be surrendered. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">A prisoner risked his life if he wore any such article past the due time. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">April was not spring, yet, in this part of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">I fact, I was never so cold in my life as I was in May of 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">I slept on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">upper bunk</span> and the wind came in from the open rafters under the <span class="DLF">roof</span> , and we had no bedding or blankets and slept in our day clothing, which consisted of a shirt and a cotton blouse of sorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">If one was lucky enough 13 https://collections.ushmm.org and worked at a <span class="DLF">construction site</span> where cement was used, the empty bags were converted into undershirts by cutting out holes at the sides and top and worn under the garment as an added layer against the wind and cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Again, you wore it at your peril for, if caught, the retribution was merciless. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">The combination of exposure; sleeplessness; total fatigue from hard work, long marches, and endless hours of standing at the morning and evening roll-calls; very little food and water; lack of medical care; non-existing sanitation; and the ever present beatings, which frequently concluded with the victim being strangled, contributed to a very short life span for the vast majority of Jewish prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Our daily food rations were minimal but were made much smaller by the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> elder and his helpers who appropriated one-fifth of the bread by dividing a loaf into five portions instead of the required four portions. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Of the margarine and occasional liverwurst or smelly cheese, we received the tiniest of fractions allotted to us, while the rest was brazenly stolen by the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> elder and either sold for other products, or distributed to his cronies and protégés. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">The soup was distributed at the <span class="BUILDING">worksite</span> at noon and was one of our supplies of drinking water. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">The fact that we did not have spoons did not, in most instances, make any difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">The soup

</span><span class="sentence" id="399">The kapo usually allowed the meat to sink to the bottom of the soup container and did not stir the contents before serving. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">The booty belonged to him and his helpers. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">At every worksite throughout the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , when it came time to line up for the soup, there was jockeying for position and ensuing pandemonium, for no one wanted to be the first in <span class="DLF">line</span> to be served from the top of the container. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Occasionally, the strategy of those who managed to line up at the end of the <span class="DLF">line</span> was rewarded with failure when the kapo decided to stir the soup at the beginning of the <span class="DLF">line</span> , or when he decided to serve from the top of the second container, instead of emptying the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">The bread ration was distributed in the evening, after roll call and it was usually eaten at once. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">That meant waiting 24 hours for the next piece of solid food, for in the morning we only received some cold, vile-tasting ersatz tea, made from some kind of leaves. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">It required discipline to forego eating the entire ration of bread at night and have some for the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">If one managed that, he could last a little longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">We envied those lucky enough to

<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  If I discount my experiences in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> throughout 1942, I would have to say yes; my sojourn in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gross-Rosen</span> was one of the harshest episodes of my incarceration, except for what was yet to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">Armed with our can of meat, which in most instances was eaten in one sitting (there is not much else one can do with an open can of meat except eat it since it is not too portable) we started out on what was to become the deadliest segment of our three and one half months long agony that took us from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> to freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">We marched for two days and lost many people until we reached some rail embarkation point. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">That was on a Thursday and we didn’t reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> (another of those <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">stone quarries camps</span> ) until the following Tuesday. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">The distance was not far at all, for <span class="COUNTRY">Bohemia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">It was snowing most of the time and we were in open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight cars</span> without any protection from the element and without blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">That can of meat was the last food issued to us until we reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> , and then some. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">That meant eight days on a pound-sized can of meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Some of us were able to lower the empty cans and scoop up some snow from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and drink the melted snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">Upon arrival in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> , there were close to 500 corpses among us. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">They died of hunger and exposure. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">That was in addition to the many that we lost on our two daylong march. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">The way up to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ’s <span class="DLF">entrance</span> led through a very steep <span class="DLF">road</span> which to us, at that time was like scaling Mt. Everest. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Our arrival at the showers coincided with a blackout due to an air raid alarm which lasted for most of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I remember a wave of naked bodies pushing towards the <span class="DLF">door</span> and attendants, using high pressure hosed with cold water, forced us back to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , while those at the <span class="DLF">wall</span> pushed us back again, and throughout all this there were dead bodies on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and their numbers increasing. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">It was a night never to be forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">When released in the morning and assigned to the <span class="BUILDING">quarantine barrack</span> , it took almost another day before we received the first morsel of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Our sleeping arrangements, due to the crowding, was an ordeal that 1s hard to convey unless experienced; it cannot be comprehended. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Imagine a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> narrower than a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">twin bed</span> , meant for one but sleeping four, packed like sardines, two heads on one end of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and two heads on the other end. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">If two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> were placed alongside each other, the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> elders felt that such an arrangement adds available <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , hence, it could accommodate ten bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> or blankets, just bare slats. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">After spending a restful night like that, we were driven out of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> in the early morning to spend the whole day <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the bitter cold, and not allowed back in until the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had several terraced levels carved out of stone and on each level were <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">I discovered that on one of the <span class="INT_SPACE">levels</span> below ours there is a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> led by the former chief kapo of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , Aloisy. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">He was a German political 17 https://collections.ushmm.org prisoner, but murderous and paranoid to boot. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">He allowed the inmates of his <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , those who didn’t go out to work, to sit on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> all day. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">They couldn’t move about -- they just had to sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">It was still better than freezing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I took a calculated risk and went down to his <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> one morning, and sat down on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> among the others, without asking his permission. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">He remembered me from many encounters in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> and I knew that if he were asked for permission, he would never grant it. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I just made myself as unobtrusive as possible, and he ignored me as if I weren’t there. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">Yet, he never asked me to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">The only problem was that by sitting there, I had to forfeit the soup in my <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="507">When he dished out the soup to his people, I grabbed a bowl and lined up, although I didn’t belong there. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Some days he ladled out a double ration for me, or called me back to receive a supplementary helping, and on other days, he would hit me and give me no soup, without ever telling me why or speaking to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">On balance, I thought that the trade-off was in my favor, 1.e., </span><span class="sentence" id="510">it was more important to be warm than to have a guaranteed soup every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">After about a month we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenburg</span> and after traveling by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> a couple of days we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leonberg</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> , by the third week of March. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">It was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> located almost in the middle of the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="513">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> served as a labor reservoir for a <span class="BUILDING">Messerschmitt plant</span> nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">The <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> was situated in an <span class="DLF">autobahn tunnel</span> which was closed off at both ends and converted to a two-level <span class="BUILDING">manufacturing facility</span> producing wings for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Messerschmitt military aircraft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="515">It was the first time since leaving <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> that I was put to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">My friend, Isaac, who left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> in October 1944, was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leonberg</span> the whole winter and worked as a riveter at the <span class="BUILDING">plant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="517">He trained me to use a riveting gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">The trouble was that I couldn’t hoist myself up on the <span class="DLF">assembly platform</span> for I was very weak. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">The food was very meager, consisting of spinach soup every day and a small ration of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Usually, completed wings would be rolled out to the <span class="DLF">autobahn</span> through the <span class="DLF">tunnel entrance</span> and picked up by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">In the entire two-week period that I was there, not a single wing left the <span class="BUILDING">assembly hall</span> , for everything that moved on the <span class="DLF">highway</span> was fair game for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">U.S. warplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I remember how amazed I was watching a unit of Wehrmacht sappers that was engaged in chiseling away at the <span class="DLF">tunnel walls</span> at both ends and packing the cavities with explosives to be detonated at the proper time. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">What amazed me was not the fact that they were going to blow up a <span class="BUILDING">production facility</span> (I often wondered whether we’ll be on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> or immolated within the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> when it occurs), or deny the Allied forces an autobahn shortcut through that <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> , but the ease and composure displayed during their work. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">They worked regular shifts, took time out for a smoke and coffee breaks, went to lunch and behaved as if they were building a <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> rather than preparing its destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Well, I never fully mastered the skill of riveting for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was evacuated on April 1, and I never found out whether the sappers’ job paid dividends or whether their orders were so construed as to prevent the success of their mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">We 18 https://collections.ushmm.org marched the better part of the day until we reached a <span class="BUILDING">rail station</span> of some small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> , or a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Another two day travel without food, and we arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaufering</span> , <span class="REGION">Upper Bavaria</span> , which was a satellite camp of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">The tiny <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there, <span class="BUILDING">huts</span> really, were half underground and half above ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">The reason for this odd design was a mystery to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> was not too crowded, there was no work for us, and the food was at near starvation level. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">When we arrived at this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> late at night, we camped out in the <span class="DLF">field</span> waiting for the processing to start in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I fell asleep, and woke up in the morning amidst a pool of rainwater. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I didn’t even know it was raining. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">We vegetated there for about two weeks, followed by yet another march and three- day <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> trip, without food, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">One thing stands out in my memory about this trip, for it restored a bit of my faith in man’s humanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">The guard in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was a Wehrmacht soldier in his fifties who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> or somewhere nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">He took out his wallet and showed us pictures of his family, among them a son on the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> .. He showed us an excerpt from a German newspaper from which we learned of the death of President Roosevelt. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">When our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> stopped at some <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , he left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in order to steal some potatoes for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">He expressed his regrets that he can’t help in any other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">We arrived at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muhldorf</span> , another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau satellite camp</span> and not that far away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaufering</span> , yet it took us three days by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">It was to be our last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> however, not our last transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muhldord</span> , I met many former inmates from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> , those who left during the mass evacuation in October 1944, as well as those from a transport of non- Polish Jewish inmates who were shipped from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in the summer of 1943 to clear the ruins of the destroyed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">They were evacuated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> at the beginning of the polish uprising there in August of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">This was the first place in my three months of wandering where I encountered some friendship and encouragement, and it helped a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">After several days of work at different work details, I was assigned one day to a group whose job it was to clear out a <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> , which was located in a converted or abandoned <span class="BUILDING">monastery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="546">We loaded a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> full of machine tools and grinding stones. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Some of it loose and some of it in heavy metal crates. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">The conveyance consisted of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer cab</span> that pulled two open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">The first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> carried the uncrated stuff plus several prisoners sent along to do the unloading. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">The second <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> held the crated material, two German civilians, and two armed guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">We had no idea of the destination of this shipment. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">The driver turned off the main <span class="DLF">road</span> and took us down a very steep <span class="DLF">road</span> leading towards a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , at which point, I suppose he was going to make a turn and proceed on the <span class="DLF">road</span> alongside the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Well, luckily for us as it turned out, he never made it to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , for he soon realized that he did not have enough braking power to prevent the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailers</span> from jackknifing into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> as 19 https://collections.ushmm.org soon as they hit the bottom of that <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="555">He turned the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cab</span> into the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> , jumped out, and hollered in German, “Jump”. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">There were three of us in the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> , my friend, Isaac, who was standing, another fellow and myself were sitting on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Isaac jumped in time, but the two of us didn’t make it and we were caught in an overturned <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> with heavy debris flying all over, including the stuff from the second <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trailer</span> which toppled. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">I lost consciousness for a moment and when I came to, I saw myself covered with debris, and people clearing it away and carrying me away from the <span class="DLF">road</span> towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I was bleeding from a cut above the eye and from a cut in the back of my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">It was as great a miracle as any that happened to me during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">There were heavy objects flying all around me, some weighing hundreds of kilograms and all I suffered, were two cuts. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Of course, no one knew whether I sustained some internal injuries or some brain injuries. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">The German driver was very upset, for he felt guilty about the accident; he tried to get some assistance but all that he managed to do was to bring a band-aid for me and a promise that someone will come to take me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ’s <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564">In the meantime, <span class="NPIP">hell</span> broke loose with the sound of exploding bombs and flak that came from a nearby town under air attack by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">U.S. warplanes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">I remember someone saying that it 1s the Allies gift to Hitler on his birthday, and that is how I know it happened on April 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Because of this air attack, we had to wait for hours until we were transported back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and when I presented myself at the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> , the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was littered with people injured during the bombing of some facilities nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Among them was a fellow from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> who took a shrapnel in his thigh. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">His survival is a saga, for he was operated on in a <span class="BUILDING">German military hospital</span> only after liberation, which was about two weeks after he was wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">He lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Miami Beach</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I received no help or sympathy from the people in the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> ; they had more serious injuries to deal with. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">I was merely assigned to a <span class="BUILDING">rest barrack</span> , where after several days we received orders to assemble for transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muhldorf camp</span> was being evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">That was to be our last transport but we didn’t know it, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">As we assembled, I overheard one of the SS guards tell someone not to worry, “You are being taken to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> ”. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">That really gave me cause to be worried for if they felt compelled to lie about our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> , that meant we were in real trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> was not <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> but straight south towards the <span class="REGION">Bavarian Alps</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">The rails of that part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> were clogged with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> full of prisoners being dragged towards the Reich’s last redoubt. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">What they had in store for us there, or how they were going to resolve the dilemma of either killing the remaining scores of thousands of Jewish concentration camp prisoners, or letting them be liberated by the Allied armies can only be conjectured. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">We traveled for several days and covered little distance, spending more time on <span class="DLF">sidings</span> , allowing other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> to pass through. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Our transport was not immune to air attacks by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">U.S. warplanes</span> , as any moving objects would be in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">The pilots had no way of knowing who was inside those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">When an alarm was 20 https://collections.ushmm.org sounded the guards locked the <span class="DLF">car doors</span> from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and took cover in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> nearby, leaving us as sitting ducks. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Luckily, there were no bombs thrown, however, we were machine-gunned and there were casualties. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">On the second or third day of our journey, we found ourselves sidetracked at a small <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="REGION">Upper Bavaria</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poeing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="585">There were rumors that the transport commander, a German army officer, ordered that the <span

class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> in order to obtain provisions for the prisoners in his charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">There were several thousand of us and hardly any food left. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">If that story had any truth to it, it would only reflect the naivete of the officer who was not attuned to the ways the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">SS camp</span> administration operated. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Once a transport left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> no one assumed the responsibility for provisioning the

if bread in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was already at the point of disintegration at that time, or about to be overrun by the U.S. Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">I don’t remember how long we had not eaten at that point, but I do recall that I was very hungry and decided to eat a raw potato that I had somehow acquired. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">I was aware of the risk, and it would have been the first time for me to ignore the possible consequences. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">No sooner had I cut, or peeled the potato when we became aware of a very loud conversation <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Someone opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> (these were closed <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , not open ones) and we were treated to a most grotesque spectacle on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> , where many prisoners were jumping and shouting, “the war is over’’, and in their excitement embraced some guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">The guard unit of our transport consisted of a motley crew of SS, Wehrmacht soldiers, and black uniformed Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">The <span class="DLF">platform</span> was littered with abandoned knapsacks belonging to the Ukrainians for they were the first to abandon the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , either out of fear of retribution or using the opportunity to desert. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">The source of the story about the war’s end was no other than the commanding officer of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="597">He went into the <span class="BUILDING">stationmaster’s office</span> to use the telephone and heard a radio announcement to that effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">He came out and said. “</span><span class="sentence" id="599">The war is over, you are free to go”. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">Of course, it was a false alarm. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">What happened was on that day, or the night before, there was an uprising in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , involving some Wehrmacht units and civilian sympathizers. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">It really took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">They declared <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> an open <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and wanted it surrendered to the Americans, rather than have it destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">However, the coup was suppressed by an SS division, and so came to a quick end, the only open insubordination of the German military in the Second World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I only recently read the details of that story in a book called The Hundred Days by John Tolen. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">He was an American war correspondent following the Allied troops into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">In the meantime, the <span class="DLF">car doors</span> were opened and masses of prisoners were milling around on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">Hundreds decided to take off and ran in all directions 21 https://collections.ushmm.org towards the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">I never did eat that raw potato and, instead, said to my friend, Isaac, if the war is really over, it’s over right here as well as in the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and there is no need to run into the unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">First things first, I said, let’s go and find the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that holds the provisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">We located it, but it was difficult for me to climb up onto a <span

some margarine. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">So did he, and we both ate ourselves full after three months of near starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Soon enough, we heard the
