QUESTION:  And tell me something about the composition of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Was it a mostly <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Were there much in the way of relationships between the Jews and the non-Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Well, it was not — it was not — I don’t — I — this I cou-couldn’t tell really, because I remember when it used to be Christmastime. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">We had to close the <span class="DLF">windows</span> and close the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , and lock the <span class="DLF">windows</span> for the protection, otherwise all — all the <span class="DLF">windows</span> would have been broken from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Cause this 1s the way it di — because th-they demonstrated during the day Christmastime. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Not the Jews, but the non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And that’s what brought up the hatred, a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">But then during the rest of the year, my father had the <span class="BUILDING">butcher store</span> , here was kosher and here was non- kosher, different <span class="NPIP">part</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So they used to come and buy meats from us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  And at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , did the Jewish children and the non-Jewish children socialize together at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  This is a hard question to answer, because when children get together, you know, they love each other, or they not — they hate each other, not e — but there was nothing really involved that we hate each other or something, just fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">But later on, you know, when I was already 12 years, 13, I remember certain things, yeah, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But by that time the Hungarians already occupied us, in 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">March 2, 2010
QUESTION:  And in terms of secular languages, did the Jewish community speak Hungarian or Romanian?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  My father spoke Hungarian, because he was in the first World War, and that was during the Hungarian time. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And most of them spoke Romanian and — but that — somebody else spoke Hungarian, I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">You know, it’s tough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">QUESTION:  And extended family, did you have an extended family living in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  I—y-yes, in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , next door was — lived my father’s sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> next, two kilometers away, lived his brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So it was always together, you could walk — Saturday you could walk the three kilometers and meet, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  And holidays you spent together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  Holidays, sometimes but not really, because everybody had a big family, and you didn’t have <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> that big, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">QUESTION:  So [indecipherable] Oh, let me record again. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">So what about your grandparents, were they in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  My mother’s father lived about half a kilometer away from us, on this side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and we lived almost on this side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But the <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> was across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from him, the <span class="BUILDING">cheder</span> where I went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">March 2, 2010
ANSWER:  And he was a very religious person, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">So the kids who came into the <span class="BUILDING">syn</span> — to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> Saturday morning, they were afraid for for Selig(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="64">His name was Selig(ph) Lassa(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Because he just took a look, and everybody was trembling.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  What was his occupation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  This I wouldn’t know, you know, what his occupation, because I think he lived to be 80 or 85 or something, you know, because he was quite old when we — we knew him, because my mother was the youngest get — to get married, and she was born in 1994.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  So let’s fast track a little bit, and I want to ask you about 1939, with the start of World War II, did news reach <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> about the invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Did you have any knowledge of what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Mm-mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  No, beca — not completely, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">The only knowledge we could know, if somebody came from that <span class="REGION">area</span> , from somewhere in [indecipherable], because there was no telephones in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">There was no electricity in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and once in a while you just got the newspaper from somewhere else, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So it’s — and nobody March 2, 2010 really knew until later, whatever happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , or whatever happened somewhere else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  But you remember people coming from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , making it into <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">ANSWER:  Yes, I— I remember that, but as a young boy, you’re not that much interest what he has to say, you know, because you wouldn’t understand it much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  You know, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I’m telling the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  So 1940 your life changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">What — tell me about the year 1940.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  In 1940, when Hitler told Horthy, whatever his name was, from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , you can re-occupy this <span class="REGION">area</span> , Maramures, you can re-occupy that you had it the first — before the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So the soldiers came and traveled days and nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">You know, they — they could not have that many soldiers that they should go around and we should see them for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But we saw the same guys coming the same day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  And how did that change your daily life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  It — not at the moment, the first year it didn’t really change, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="89">The only thing is, we had to learn a different language and we went to [indecipherable] <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and we didn’t understand anything what we — because it was Hungarian already, <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So you didn’t understand anything, because we went to <span class="BUILDING">Romanian school</span> as children, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">March 2, 2010
QUESTION:  Was it the same teachers, or did they bring in all new teachers who were Hungarian born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  I’m sure they ki — brought in the teachers, because the teachers that we knew — and I really didn’t know whether they speak hungar — I know my father spoke Hungarian for one reason, because the soldiers must have had on their agenda certain things that Yorel(ph) Pollak was — was a g-gender(ph) urmeshda(ph) they call it that time, like a — not a general — not a — 1n the army, like a— how do you call it? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">A little officer, you know, in the army, in the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So the soldiers who passed through my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , some of them stopped in our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they wanted to have some wine to drink and this [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">So I knew, but we were not allowed to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> when they talked to my father, as children. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Nobody was allowed to know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  And your father never told the children —
ANSWER:  He wouldn’t — he wouldn’t — he wouldn’t hurt us, you mean, he wouldn’t say that that’s what they said, and things like th — but later on, we felt something 1s not right. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">But at 1942 already, I had somebody come, a friend came from — who went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> a half a year before. [</span><span class="sentence" id="99">indecipherable] And he says, Ernie, you’re already 13 - 14 years old, 15 years old, 15 and a half years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Come to me with — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and you'll learn a trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">What are you gonna do in this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I was March 2, 2010 very good with my hands and making, you know, certain things, you know, in jewelry or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">So he says, come, you’re gonna become a jeweler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="104">QUESTION:  And did you take him up on that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  And I went right after Pesach, when he went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> and I couldn’t get anything on the jewelry, I couldn’t get — so he says, let’s go to a <span class="BUILDING">dental laboratory</span> , maybe you’re gonna be — they’re going to teach you to be a dental technician, cause he was there in that <span class="NPIP">place</span> also. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">But he quit after a while, you know, so I went in there and I stood there til the Germans came in, for a year and a half, almost two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">QUESTION:  So w-were — from 1942 to 1944, you’re living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  And did you have any contact with your family, did you know what was going on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mamorsha(ph</span> )?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  Yes, because we used to write, we used to write almost every week, you know, in Yiddish we used to write the postcard. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But my older brother was with me that time, because he also wanted to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> , away from the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , let’s put it this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  And was the motivation for coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> because they thought it was easier to earn a living, or because — March 2, 2010
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  — they were politically safer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  No, easier to earn a living, because politically I did not — I don’t know whether anybody as young boys and girls thought about politically at that time, but they saw that you could sense certain thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">You sensed it, but you didn’t make anything of it, as long as you were okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">But to make a living had gotten harder in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so I figured I got to learn a trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  And from the postcards that your family sent to you, did you have a sense that their life changed over those two years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  Yes, the last year especially.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  So we used to have our own <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you know, we were three butchers [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And we had the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we just — to take the cows, or the March 2, 2010 calf, or the — the — to slaughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">But as soon as the Hungarians came in, they forbid you. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">You’re not allowed to get a shochet to slaughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">How do you have to slaughter the cow? </span><span class="sentence" id="131">You got to hit it right here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  And so wa —
ANSWER:  Which is — that’s ridiculous because when you’re slaughtering, the reason why you slaughter the cow, because you’re — you’re taking all the veins, which are here, and the blood comes out from the animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So this is what you call it the kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Nothing could happen to the — to the — to the meat, or to whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So that [indecipherable] so, right away, even while I was still <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  — surreptitiously as well?</span></p>
