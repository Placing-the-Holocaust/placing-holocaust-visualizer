<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell me your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name 1s Mady Deutsch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> at the time and the name of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berehovo</span> , on April 29, 1930.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Tell me about your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Well, my family were a very close and loving family. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My father conducted his business from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and therefore I saw him quite a bit during the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the mornings and in the afternoon I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and...uh...spent time with my father as well as my mother who was a homemaker and she just took care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">That was her sole job. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And I had a brother who was 6 years older than I. And we lived in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Uh...I would call ourselves...uh...like middle income family. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I had all the comforts, and all my needs were covered. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">We used to go away in the summertime into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> for vacations...uh...during the Christmas school holiday or the....uh...holiday during Easter with... visited some family in different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , about 50, 60 miles away from where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And my...my cousins would come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we would just exchange...uh...these visits and we were a very very tight knit family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">QUESTION:  Tell me about you and <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">ANSWER:  Well, I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> obviously in the mornings up until about 2 o'clock in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And...uh...in the afternoons during the summer, I would go with my friends swimming. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We played ball. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Uh...My friends who lived in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , they...uh...used to go to each other's <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I also went to a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> , which was right after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And Saturday mornings we had...uh...religion but more the...1instead of studying just history, we were...uh...learning how to read Hebrew and in the early stages that was okay, but then later on when the anti-Semitism became worse, they were not...the Hungarian government was not very cooperative and didn't want to...us to learn...uh...or get education in the Hebrew language or the Hebrew history, and that was little by little eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Uh...I'd say about 1938...39,...uh...the anti-Semitism just became worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">We heard...my father was a avid reader of the newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">He read every paper that was available. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We had a radio that...but no television at the time obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And my father and my mother were listening to the news all the time to know what was going on in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And we had heard things happening, but nothing of what was to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">There were even some rumors that some people escaped from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> over to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and they were telling about some horror stories what were...what was being done to Jews there. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">But nobody would believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">They thought it...somebody lost their minds to come up with horror stories such as this. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So they never...they totally disregarded this. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">But I remember all these conversations only my parents talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">That was in 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I was only a 8 year old child, and I was still just playing with my friends and I just heard these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And thinking back, these little bits and pieces of...uh...this information are coming back to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">As a matter of a fact, my mother had a sister...that was her youngest sibling, who met a young man...I would say probably the early part of 1938, who was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> about maybe 20 miles away from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> ...or our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and he and his family...uh...emmigrated. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">They came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And when he was a young man around early part of 1938 he came back to visit his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and traveled around and visited different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And he met my aunt who was a very beautiful, maybe 20, 21 year old young woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I mean very, very beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And they really fell in love and decided to get married and that she would come back with her...with him to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="41">But that time already again the government interfered in all kinds of things...everythings happens throughout the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And they were having a hard time trying to get the papers for her to be able to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So he had to be back a certain time. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">That was because his visa expired, and he had to come back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and her papers were not approved yet at that time so that she couldn't come back with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So they said that she should stay there and they will try to make all the arrangements for her papers to be cleared so that she can join him. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">But this went on for months and months and months and writing to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> to the government and to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> which was again part of the time 1t was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , part of the time 1t was again <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">In November 9th of 1938, the Hungarians took back this part of <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So we were dealing again with two governments. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">So they had a awful lot of problems, and they just could not accomplish...uh...what they set out to do to clear her so that she could join him. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">When he saw that the war was imminent...you know it was just about any time now. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So he decided to come...to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and he was there maybe 48 hours and he took care of all the papers and visa and everything and then they let her go with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And they came out with the very last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> just before the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And they settled in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> where they raised a child and lived a very beautiful life all these years until, of course, she heard what happened to the rest of her family in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">After she came out and...uh...things were getting worse in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And more and more anti- Semitism was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">People were...uh...being arrested, falsely accused of all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Uh...Students couldn't not go into higher education because that became what they called the Numerus Klausus and only a certain number of students were allowed in higher education. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And the...only way that my brother and I were able to get into this Klausus because our grades were excellent. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And my parents put an awful lot of emphasis on us getting a good education and studying and learning and they were always supervising that we should get the best of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And education was one of the most important things in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">But as time went on, it was getting more and more difficult in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">The teachers were quite anti-Semitic and they made learning very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And if we deserved a grade A in a subject, we would get maybe a C, just barely passing so that we were not treated like the other students. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And neither were grown-ups, adults in <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Uh...Doctors and attorneys and professional people were...were already not allowed to practice their profession because they were no longer trusted. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">You know, the Aryan race was something super special so Jewish doctors could no longer take care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And then businesses were little by little taken...uh...away. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">They...the government and...uh...would put somebody else, an Aryan, into a business to sort of run it. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It was still so-called Jewish owned, but a Hungarian was already in charge and little by little it was worked so that the Aryan or the Hungarian who was the one that was going to be the beneficiary, so little by little this 1s what was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Then in March of 1944...uh...Hitler and Germans invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And I can remember clear as a bell as if I would hear it right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">We had guests over the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> when the news came over the radio, which by the way we could only listen to at that point under...uh...coverings you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">The draperies had to be drawn completely because we were not allowed to listen to the...uh...the news from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> or from different parts of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">That was already against the law. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">But somehow, you know, somebody was always watching out, looking <span class="NPIP">outside</span> if any...there was any Hungarian...uh...official or the gendarmes or the...uh...police anywhere nearby so that other people in the family or in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> could listen to the radio and could listen to the news and what was happening everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So when my parents heard on the radio that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , my mother's words were quote "this is the end of us" unquote. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And I can...I was only 13 years old, but I still remember those words. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And little did we know at that time how true...how close to the truth it came. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">We didn't know what was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">We didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">It's just the...the fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">It is just what we have heard, what we have read...what my parents have read. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">As I said, I was just a child and I wasn't really aware of everything that was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But this is what they were afraid of. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And sure enough within a matter of a couple of weeks, there were many decrees issued, and one of the first ones was to wear the yellow star on the outer garment in the front as well as in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">That if we were on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> we would be recognized as Jews and, therefore, secondary citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">They could keep an eye on us so we...so that we could not...we could not go on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> after dark or before dawn. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We could be only when we could be vis...visible during the day, and there were many other decrees of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">This is when they really strictly enforced...uh...all the...uh...other decrees that I was talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">It was semi-official until now. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">As doctors not being able to practice, they were no longer allowed in the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And businesses now were being taken, actually taken away, not just having somebody in there that would run it you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And...uh...little by little, it became just worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Within weeks, it was...it was matter of weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">We were in April...it was the beginning of April...I think we were invaded around the end of March, and in April already we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And what was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Now what happened here was the German SS, in cooperation...with total cooperation of the Hungarian police and the Hungarian gendarmes, came to our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> very early in the morning at dawn and knocking real hard and "Jews, Get out of your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Get out and line up in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We couldn't imagine what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I mean it was just a horrible, horrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">The children were screaming, and all of us were...were afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">We didn't know what was happening and what was to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And then we were told that we will be allowed back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for just a few minutes to get a little suitcase or a little handbag in which we could put a change of clothing and maybe some food, just dry food like a piece of bread or something that we had and then we were to come out again and line up in front of the...our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">So we each got a little bag and put just the bare minimum in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And then we were being marched down the <span class="DLF">streets</span> where there was the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">There were several little <span class="REGION">areas</span> that were designated as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> where the Jews were congregated. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Now where we were it was just down the <span class="DLF">street</span> in the...uh...<span class="DLF">back yard</span> of our neighbor where they were making...uh...barrels, the kind that they store wines in right now, and they were also making...in some of the bigger <span class="REGION">areas</span> and different areas in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ...they were making brick. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And so instead of us being ushered into <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> where we will be staying, these were like just a <span class="DLF">carport</span> ...just a covering to protect us somewhat from the rain and the sunshine, the strong sun. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">But there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">There was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It just...1f we took a blanket with us or a change of clothing, that's all we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So we were herded into this <span class="REGION">area</span> and surrounded by...uh...fences so that we could not go anywhere of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And the Hungarian soldiers and gendarmes were surrounding us so that there was no way of getting out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And then we were getting...when we got into this <span class="NPIP">place</span> and...uh...we were to put down our belongings under this <span class="REGION">area</span> where...under the coverings of these...like carports and the Germans and the police and the Hungarian gendarmes erected a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">podium</span> and they stood up in front of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">They...uh...we had to come out from underneath and line up in front of these...uh...carports or <span class="REGION">area</span> where we were standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And they erected this little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">podium</span> and they stood up there and they said to us the following. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">We will place barrels and buckets all along on front of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And you are to place all your money...all your valuables in these barrels and buckets. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Now don't get any idea on not putting them 1n there because we are going to search you afterwards and if we find as much as a penny on you, you will be lined up against a <span class="DLF">wall</span> ...and they showed us a <span class="DLF">wall</span> right near by...and you'll be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But this was the day of my 14th birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So it was the worst, but in the end one of the best days of my life because my parents placed everything...what they thought was everything...all the belongings in these buckets and barrels because there were the Germans and the SS and the gendarmes and police with guns all over them...belts with revolvers all around them and each one had at least one gun on their shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">They were very, very threatening. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And we were very law abiding, peaceful citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">We didn't have any guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We had nothing to protect ourselves with. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So when we were herded out of our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and into this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , all we had with us that little change of clothing and nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So we had no way of protecting us and we had no way...it just made no...no sense to really protect although we tried, and those that did were beaten up something terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But we had no way of protecting against all these guns and against these SS and against these soldiers...you know the police and the gendarmes. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So they did and we did as we were told. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So everybody took off their jewelry and money...whatever money was in the pockets and everybody placed them in the buckets and the barrels. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">However, there were people who were wearing a watch perhaps since they were a child or a wedding band for 10, 20, or 30 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And they were so used to these that they didn't even realize anymore that they had it on. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And they might have forgotten to put it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And these people were taken and lined up against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> to be shot later. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Among them were...was my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">When he was searched after placing all these things into these barrels and buckets, they found a small amount...like a dollar bill in one of his little vest pockets and because of that, he was lined up against the war to be shot too. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Now, this is my 14th birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And my father was to be shot in front of my eyes momentarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">It was a horrible time. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But apparently they were...the SS and the gendarmes and the police were not given orders yet to kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Apparently, they were just given orders to use the worst scare technics on us so that we would follow orders exactly as they wished...as they wanted us to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So after several hours until they collected all these loots, all these goodies they released all these people that were lined up against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Well, as I said, it was also one of the happiest moments of my life because my father wasn't to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And that was in the end my happy 14th birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">He was freed. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ...in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> about 2 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We could not leave because we were surrounded by the Hungarian gendarmes and the police who were very, very happy to cooperate with the Germans because they were all promised rewards for their...for the job that they were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">So they were at times even more cruel than the Germans just to prove that they...they really meant what they were saying, that they were going to cooperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">They were beating us even in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where it wasn't really necessary but they felt that they are going to be rewarded so they were beating us 10 times worse than the Germans at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">About 2 weeks after we were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we were again lined up and marched to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And at the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> there was a very, very long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> waiting for us ready to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Now these were not regular <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> in which normally people travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">These were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> , you know, in which normally animals are being transported. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">Each had about 2 little <span class="DLF">windows</span> on either <span class="NPIP">side</span> in which the fresh air would come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Normally when animals are being transported in such manner, they just put them in sparsely so they're comfortable for whatever journey they are taking. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">But when we were placed into these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> , we were packed 1n like herrings or sardines in a can. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">There was no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We were practically on top of one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And we were given two buckets after we were packed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">One was a bucket of water, and the other was a empty bucket for personal elimination for the whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> full of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We were so tightly packed that if a person wanted to reach over to somebody else, that person had to climb over several other people in between...let's say a father and mother were sitting here with their children, but a child wants to reach another child a little further down, a friend perhaps, that child had to climb over adults to reach that person because there was just no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">We were traveling in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> for about 3 days and 3 nights with just a drop of water that we were all each able to get because there were probably about a hundred people so one bucket of water, all you could get was just a few drops. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">During the day it was very, very hot because we were so crowded in and just the little bitty <span class="DLF">windows</span> that we got some fresh air in. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And at night it was very cold because we were traveling through the high <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Of course, we didn't know where we were going, and we were just freezing. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So nighttime freezing, daytime horribly, horribly hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And no food and just a little drop of water which went the very first day. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And we were traveling and traveling and we had no idea where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">We were trying to look through those little <span class="DLF">windows</span> to see if we recognized where we were, but nobody knew where we were or where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So after about 3 days and 3 nights of traveling, we stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> had stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">It was night time. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Couldn't see anything except flames in the distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">The odor that was coming in through those little <span class="DLF">windows</span> into those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> were horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">We didn't know what that was. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">It was burning...like burning flesh, but who would...whose mind would enter something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It was a horrible odor, and just flames in the distance and howling of the dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">We didn't know where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And we just had to wait and wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And we heard voices in German and we had no idea what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Where we were or what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So after it started to get a little light <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , we began to see movement and we saw SS soldiers with their insignia on their sleeves and their hats and guns on their shoulders, on the waist and with the big, big police dogs that they were walking up and down and speaking to one other and shouting to one another in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We still had no idea where we were or what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">All we could finally see as it was getting light...wires, barbed wires about 10, 12 feet high with wires going across...like electric wires going right through them. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And we still didn't know where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We didn't know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Finally, the SS brought over a whole bunch of men in grey and blue striped uniforms and they brought along with them like a flat top <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> ...2 wheels with a flat top <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> and two handles. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">And they were all lined up <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and all the SS with all these dogs and all these men in the uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Finally, the SS started to open up the <span class="DLF">doors</span> to these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> ...to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box cars</span> and we were told to get off and just line up right next to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">As we were getting off, these men in the uniform...uh...told us to line up in fives and told us exactly where. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Just right along side the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ...side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And then after we all came off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and was standing there, then the job of these men were to climb upon these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> and on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> ...the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> and remove what we found out later were bodies of people who died along the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">They were older people who couldn't handle this horrible cold and heat and no food and no water. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">They were sick people. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Could have had a heart condition or whatever and died along the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">There were infants who had no water and the cold and the heat...they just couldn't last. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So there were countless people who died along the way and they were taken off now by these men who were inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Now these people have been in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> already 6 months to 3 years or prior to that because what we found out much later these were inmates that were taken from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ...Jews...political prisoners who did not agree with the German's philosophy, and these people were there and they were doing this labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">This was was the...their job to take the people who died along the way and they put all these dead people on this <span class="DLF">platform</span> , two- wheeled <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cart</span> , and then they were taking them off and straight to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> where, within minutes, they were burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Of course, we didn't know any of these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We just saw them take off these dead people, and we were still to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> there because the police...I mean the SS at this point already was there with their police dogs and we were standing there because anybody dared to move, they just released the dog who teared people apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So first the took away the people who were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Then there were other men who came and separated the men from the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And we still had no idea where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">But some of these people...these inmates were whispering to some of the people who had just arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">We...we asked...not me as a child, but my parents or their friends asked, "Where are we? </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Where are we? </span><span class="sentence" id="209">What is this <span class="NPIP">place</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And he says...they said, "Don't you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="211">You are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And we didn't know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> meant or what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">And they kept asking, "Where are we? </span><span class="sentence" id="214">What is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And he says...and they kept saying, "This is the place where all your parents and your grandparents and your babies were killed and will be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">This is the largest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination camp</span> in all of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and you may not survive this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp."</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And we were told at the time, you know, to just line up and relax because you're going to be taken to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and your will be given clean clothes and you'll be working in a nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="218">So just keep calm because they tried to avoid any reaction, any commotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">They wanted to keep us as calm as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">And these men kept saying under their...while they were gathering up these dead.." You may never make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Everybody that comes here is dead 1n a short time." </span><span class="sentence" id="222">We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So first we were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">My father with my brother and my mother and I and all the men on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> and all the women on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And they were...the men were going in one direction and then the women were going...marched in another direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And as we were marching we came to...uh...fork in the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And at this fork in the <span class="DLF">road</span> was a very well dressed handsome officer with a small stick like a conductor's baton in his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And he would motion to the left or to the right which direction a person was to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Again not knowing where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">What was the direction for...for all we know is that older people and little children were directed to go in one direction and the younger, healthier looking people were going in the opposite direction. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Still not knowing where we are going or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">But my mother was a very, very intelligent woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Spoke several languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And when she saw this well dressed officer who had a couple of...uh...assistants near him...and when she saw that this officer was directing the older people to go in one <span class="NPIP">direction</span> and the younger people in the other direction, she must have had some kind of a intuition because she told me, "Mady. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Straighten yourself up. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Straighten up your body." </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And she pinched my cheeks that I should look very healthy because after this trip of 3 days and 3 nights in this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> without food or water, we all looked horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And she said, "Straighten up. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I want you to look older than you are." </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And when it was our turn to face this officer, she said in German, "I'm 43 and she's 14." </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And because apparently he was impressed with my mother's appearance and her conduct and her command of the German language, he motioned us to the direction where the healthy, younger people were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Later, we found out who this elegant officer was who decided who is going to live and who is going to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And his name was Doctor Josef Mengele, and he also selected not just these younger, healthier looking people to go to work for them or do whatever they felt that we could do for them, he also selected at this point as they were...as the people were marching in front of him...twins, and possibly dwarfs or people who were very tiny or anything that was unusual looking because he wanted later to conduct various experiments. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">We were marched in one direction heading toward some <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we were told that we're going to get...take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and we're gonna be given clean clothes and then we'll be taken to some <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we will work. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">The same thing was told to these older people and the children...that we are going to take you to this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where you're going to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and get fresh clothes and you will be well taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">They didn't mention labor or work, but you will be well taken care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So this to keep everybody as calm as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But when these people, the older women and mothers with their babes in their arms or holding the hand of the little child were taken into this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and yes, there were shower heads about every few feet and everybody was to get undressed completely to take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and when they did, they were to leave their clothes in an empty <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , dropping everything and they were told that they'll get their clothes later and not to worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">They'll just be disinfected and cleaned, and they'll get it...they'll get it later, but first we'll get...they'll get some fresh clean clothes after the shower. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">But instead of getting water from these faucets...from these spickets in the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> , they got gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And within minutes they all fell dead to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="252">They were after awhile...they were crawling on the <span class="DLF">walls</span> trying...they were found near the <span class="DLF">doors</span> or near the <span class="DLF">walls</span> trying to reach for some <span class="DLF">air</span> for...as they were found later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="253">QUESTION:  Did you see any of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  I did not see them because they were in one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They were in one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and we were 1n another. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">We have seen...we have been told, and we have seen movies later on that the Germans themselves took movies of these people as how they were trying to escape and told by these inmates that...whose job again was after they were gassed and they fell to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and died...it was their job again to go back into these <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> and gather up these bodies and again put them on these flat boards and take them straight to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">So they were telling us later again what they have seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And this is how they had to get people from the <span class="DLF">walls</span> and near the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , trying to get a breath of...last breath of fresh air. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And that's how they all died. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">They were put on these flat top <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and straight to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">QUESTION:  Let's come back to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I would like to focus on what happened to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">You...When you and your mother went to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">Tell us where you went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  I was going to come to that right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">We also were marched now toward this other <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that looked just like the one where the older people and the younger children went. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">We too went into a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> which is <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> and we were told to take our clothes off and put all the clothes down there and we were going to go into the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we were to get a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and then get fresh clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And yes we were going into the next <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where we, in fact, did take a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">We did get water and we take...took a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And from there, we went into another big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> right adjacent to the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span> where there was German soldiers with little scissors or these little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hand machines</span> that they normally they would trim the back of the hair when you go to...uh...get a haircut. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And with that...with those scissors, or with those little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> , they cut off or they shaved our heads, under the arms and the pubic area. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And mind you these were all men doing this on women to just further dehumanize us. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I mean women tried to be modest, tried to cover up, but there was nothing to cover up with. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We were stark naked standing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And we went through this dehumanizing...uh...process of being shaven by all these men after which we were all given a clean dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">It was a grey...like a men's shirt, a grey shirt, but very long. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So whether you were 4 feet 8 inches tall and weighing maybe 90 pounds or you were...uh...5 feet 10 inches tall and being...weighing 180 pounds, we all got the same dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So those that were short, the dress was down to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Those that they were heavier and taller, they might have reached above the knees. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And we had at this point no hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And when...if a mother and daughter or two sisters stood next to one another, they didn't recognize each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">They had to call for each one by name. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Mother didn't mean anything because there was other mothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">They would say Mother Helen or Mother Elizabeth or Sister...uh...Suzanne or whoever...because you did not recognize each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">We looked so horrible without hair and with just this dress that some short, some long. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">And it was just an awful, awful experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But that too we survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">From here again we were lined up in rows of fives and we were marched to <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And when we were marched into these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> like...let's say the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> looked like an <span class="BUILDING">army barrack</span> , but inside there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">What they had was <span class="DLF">platforms</span> made out of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Like three tiers, approximately 6 feet wide and about 6 feet deep before it was partitioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And between each row of the three rows, there were maybe about 2 and a half feet of <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And we were to climb into these <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicles</span> and lie down there and there were...we were again packed in side by side so...so tightly that if a person was uncomfortable and very...tried to move or turn over, everybody in this <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicle</span> had to turn over with him because there was just no <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> any other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">So this is where we stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">This is where we slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">And next morning it was still pitch dark...I'd say probably about 4 o'clock in the morning, we were lined up in front of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , again with the SS, with the police dogs with the guns everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And they were...we were to be counted. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So we were standing <span class="NPIP">outside</span> 3 or 4 hours a day until the SS that was in charge of the day to count us came by and counted the row. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Only thing that I forgot to mention was that when we were marching from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> toward...to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , we were so dehydrated and hungry and thirsty that whenever we saw a little water whether it was a <span class="DLF">fountain</span> or a puddle...whatever, we were just so dehydrated we try to grab a drink and everybody was running for some water whether it was in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wash basin</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Little did we know that we should have never touched that water because that was highly contaminated in the following way. </span><span class="sentence" id="301"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in 1944, when we got there, was already a very efficient killing machinery. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">They already had the <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">gas ovens</span> going 24 hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">That was very, very easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">It was like a speedy mechanized way of killing people. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">But years prior when they first opened it, they didn't have all of this, so the way they killed the people that they brought there was that they had to dig <span class="DLF">ditches</span> maybe 10 foot deep and after they dug these <span class="DLF">ditches</span> , there were lined up against the edge of the <span class="DLF">ditches</span> and they were shot in the back, killing them and these people fell into these <span class="DLF">ditches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And then those few people that they kept that were in charge again like these men that were in charge of taking the people to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , they were also charged in covering up these...uh...these 10 feet ditches with all these people in there with just some dirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">But through the years, the bodies were eroding. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">They were deteriorating, and as the fluids from the bodies went into seep into the ground and washed down by the underground water, it went into the water system. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">So the water that we drank to try to quench our horrible thirst was in fact poison because we were poisoned by this water...this sewer water that was the bodies gave out and went into the water system. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So when we were in the...in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and then when we consequently had to stand 3, 4 hours in front of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> morning and evening to be counted, we got very, very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">We were very weak, especially the little people like myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I was, you know, very, very frail and very small and I had just turned 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And I got very, very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And so were many others. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So those people who were...did not get quite sick or didn't have to take part in the water, they were standing erect all this time and those of us that were so horribly sick that we couldn't even stand up, we were sitting on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> until the Germans got close enough that we would have to stand only for a minute or two and then we...they helped us stand up and supporting us more or less from the back or from the side so that we could stand up long enough for that minute or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Because when they came to count us, they were also looking us over because if anybody looked sick or older than what they thought or weak, they would just take him right out and off they went to the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So these so called selections were actually taking place continuously. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">So while we were standing there and then they went on and on, then we finally after 3 or 4 hours after we were counted, we could go back into the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and lie down on this...on this...uh... platforms or <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicles</span> and that's where we were staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Now, fortunately our group only stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> for about a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">We were needed in an <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> in the Polish-German area near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breslau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">Of course, again, we didn't know anything about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">We were just loaded up one morning, you know, when it was just first getting... getting...beginning to get light into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> covered with canvas. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And we were traveling for a few hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">We didn't know where to. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And they didn't want us to see where we are going or what was in the surrounding <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So we were taken for hours in this...these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and then we arrived to our <span class="NPIP">destination</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Again, we didn't know where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">But we just saw lots of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> surrounding us, and again unloading us and then we saw <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And we were taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and we were herded again in front of them and being counted and counted and counted again. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And we found out that we are in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camp</span> where there were already about 5, 6 hundred women...uh...from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="331">These were Jewish women who were taken years before and they had been working 1n this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> already for some period of time and they were also taken from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and from other...uh... exterminating and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> and they were needed here so they brought them here. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And then we were joined...we joined them. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And we found out that we are going to work in a <span class="BUILDING">ammunition factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">So we were woken up again, like about 5 o'clock every morning and lined up and counted again and then we would be given a piece of moldy, dark bread and what they called coffee was like...more like a luke warm brown water. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And that was to last for the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And some people were...couldn't even last to try to take a piece of it during...in the morning _____ and then save some for later and then others...well, some people just ate the whole thing right then and there because they were so hungry they could...they just couldn't last. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And then others were portioning themselves to have a couple of bites 2 hours from now and another couple of bites a little bit later. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">But anyway this was our meal for the day that we were to work on first marching about an hour to this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and another hour back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where we were staying. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And we were working 1n this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and you have to understand what we were...what we had to do in order to survive because whoever resisted was killed on the spot so there was no if...1t was a choice.

<p><span class="sentence" id="362">ANSWER:  My mother was an...a astonishing woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">She was 43 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">I can thank her my survival because I didn't know when she took that piece of bread from me to...for safekeeping for the day to give me a piece, you know, every few hours to sort of sustain me through all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And not only did she give me the piece of bread that I was given, she was giving me a piece of her bread without me knowing so that I would have a little bit more food so I could go on and survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">We didn't know for how long or what or what's going to...to happen the very next day or the next hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">But she was giving me part of her bread, which I only found out later after the war was over what she was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">She gave the last...what ever she could come...she would protect me. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">She would cover me when they were marching rain, snow, cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">All we had this...was this one grey dress with...which by the way we..the only time we were able to clean was on Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">And boy Sunday was a special day. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">We only worked 6 days a week in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">As I said we would be woken up around 5 o'clock in the morning and stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> until counted for a couple of hours and then marched to the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and then work there for about 12 works without...well, we had a half hour break simply...not for us...not for the inmates, just so that the Germans who worked there and who were running the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and the SS that were watching us, that they could take a break for some lunch.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">Tape #2
QUESTION:  Well, we're back to Sundays being very special because we did not have to go to work in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">What we did was, again, of course, being counted in the morning and given the warm coffee and a piece of bread for the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">And then we were to scrub the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where were we staying and the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> spotless. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And that was being inspected after we thought we cleaned it. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And if the SS was not satisfied, then we got the beatings of our life time and start all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">And we did this most of the day...a good part of the day just cleaning and scrubbing and spotless again, inspection, and back to square one. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And then toward the end of the day we were given the specialty of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">We would have a special meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">It wasn't just the hot water they called soup with the green leaves floating in it for the...the meal for the end of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">We were given a soup that had potatoes in it and I hope you don't get sick if I tell you what else was in there which we felt was the delicacy of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">That was horse meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And if...as we were dealt this soup and if in the ladle a little piece of that horse meat got caught among those couple of potatoes and the green leaves, it was like the delicacy that we called like a piece of caviar that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And it...this is what we were looking forward to all week. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">This is the main meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">This was once a week that we had a little bit more than just the plain brown water with a little moldy piece of bread and the hot water with green leaves, you know, at the end of the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And this is how we were for almost a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">In this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Peterswaldau</span> ' and the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> if I can still remember is called Diehl, I think, D-I-E-H-L. And this is where these parts of the bombs and ammunition were being made by us, the inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">The last month or so we were already---the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> apparently didn't...they did not have the raw material to continue with this so they utilized us ..uh...for dig...digging <span class="DLF">fox holes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="396">Because the front was getting closer and closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">The Russians were already very, very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And in order to protect those remaining soldiers who were already at this point either older men or little kids because all the able men were already killed off. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">And we were to dig these <span class="DLF">fox holes</span> in which these last remaining <span class="NPIP">front</span> was being fought. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I must have weighed maybe...if I was lucky maybe 50, 60 pounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">I was like a skeleton. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">I was very small to start with. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">When I had to pick up this shovel in order to...to dig these <span class="DLF">ditches</span> (laughing) it was heavier than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">It felt like God only knows what I'm lifting in order to..but I had to keep digging and I had to try because if I didn't or those who didn't were pulled out of there and they were shot, taken to the side of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">That was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">They had no use for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Why feed another mouth when they can use that food either for themselves because they themselves were already very low...excuse me...on food. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">There was very little available. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Everything was sent to the front, you know, where they were fighting the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So they were just...whoever couldn't perform, they were just killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">How I lasted, I'll never know. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Must have been my mother's encouragement always. "</span><span class="sentence" id="413">Try a little '<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Peterswaldau</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women's camp</span> within the larger system of CC Gross-Rosen, situated to the southeast of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German city</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gera</span> , near the <span class="DLF">Czech border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">It provided slave labor for the two German concerns Diehl and Haase. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">harder. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Try. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">Make believe you are doing it even if you...you're unable to. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Try." </span><span class="sentence" id="419">And she kept giving me her food again which I didn't know, just to give me a little bit more strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And we just kept on and she says, "Maybe we'll get out of here soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">Maybe we're gonna see your father and brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Maybe we'll see your grandparents and aunts and uncles when we come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Try a little harder. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">Let's try. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Let's see. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Maybe we can survive it. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">Maybe we can make tt. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">You hear the...the guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">They are not that far. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">Just hold off a little bit longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Try a little harder. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And her encouragement made me just try and force myself just a little bit longer...just a little bit longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And then came one morning when normally we are woken, you know, it was still dark <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ...and nothing was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="435">The Germans, the SS, the dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">The lady who was Jewish who was in charge of this small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and she was responsible to the SS, and she was to line us up and then the SS came to count us...but she was like a liaison between the inmates and the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And she would come, you know, out and she would go out to the...uh...wait for the...uh...SS and there was nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But she was allowed to go into their <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where they were staying and she would knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and go in to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and there was no SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And then she went from one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> to the other <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="441">There was nobody there. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Apparently, the SS fled during the cover of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And which we found out later was the last day of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">This is when everything was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">It was May 8th, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Now this lady...I don't have to tell you is a beautiful, blonde woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">And she was in charge and she just ran out the square in front of all these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and she screamed, "We are free. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">The war is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">We are free." </span><span class="sentence" id="450">It was like...we were hearing things. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">It was like the Messiah had come. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Standing there with her arms up in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="453">We are free." </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And we were like wild animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">We just broke out of those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and we ran out and we were crying and we were laughing and then we were hugging and we were kissing. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And we were doing just anything and every emotion a humanbeing has ever been capable of, we were all emoting all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And it was just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">It...1t was just the most remarkable occasion or day of...of anybody's existence. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And we burst open the <span class="DLF">gates</span> and we just ran out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and we just ran on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="460">But we went first...we broke into what they called the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> where they kept their...whatever food there was left because we were so hungry...all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">I mean living under...a little meager piece of bread and the so-called soup, that we broke into this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> and...where...all we could find at this point...I mean there was...they had hardly anything themselves because as I explained, you know, everything had to go to the people who were fighting the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">But we did find some of this moldy old bread and some margarine and some sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">And I still remember we, with our hands, we broke a piece of bread and if found any kind of utensil like a knife or spoon or whatever, fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">If not, we were just grabbing some margarine and smearing it right on the bread and getting into that sugar and pouring it on and stuffing it in our mouths. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">If I just think of it, I'm getting sick right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">But it was the...the most delicious thing in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And we were so hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">We were so starved. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">We were just...just stuffing it in as...as fast as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And this too was another thing we should not have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">You see people don't think. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I mean under these circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">From total starvation to push all this very rich food into our bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">The body couldn't take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">It rejected it. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">A lot of people died there within days. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">The body couldn't...couldn't absorb it. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">It couldn't take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And people died from the very thing that should have saved them. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And the Ger...the Russian soldiers came marching in. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">When they saw us, they couldn't believe their eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I mean we were like skeletons. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And most of the people had to be lifted from...you know, from practically crawling and they put us...put us on...uh...like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stretchers</span> , you know, with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulance</span> ...put us into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ambulances</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">A lot of people were put into <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> where the doctors from the occupied forces started taking care of them immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">They started to bury the dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And then they started to take us out of there and finding us <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where the Germans who lived there who were witnesses to all of these, they saw us marching to and from the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> where they knew what we were making and they were employed there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">This is a very big <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">They were the people that trained us, what to do and how to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And they knew that if they are caught by the Allies that they will be either punished or put in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> or whatever, so they too ran away. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">So there were these...their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , and the Russian soldiers took us in and gave us these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> to stay in until we are recuperated a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And they brought us some food and medical care to these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> where we stayed for...for about 2 or 2 weeks to gather a little bit of strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And as we were getting stronger, there was only one thought we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">To get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to see if anybody from the family had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Our...what kept us alive all this time was thinking about and dreaming about them and hoping that we will meet again, that they'll survive as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">And then we'll be one happy family again. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And this is what my mother kept me alive with. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Always. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">And so here we...she said again, "Eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Try to get a little more strength so that we can go as soon as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">Try to travel back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and maybe your father is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Maybe your brother is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Maybe my parents, meaning her parents, and brothers and sisters...maybe somehow they survived too. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So after about 3 weeks of this nourishment and medical care, we somehow had gotten back enough strength that we embarked on this journey back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">A lot of the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> were bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> on a lot of miles and miles. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">So we tried to...uh...hitch a ride from farmers to carry us to a certain distance and then when...where they had to get off, then we tried some mode mode of transportation and it took us several weeks until we finally got back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">A journey which going there took us only about 3 days and 3 nights, now it took us that many weeks to get back. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And when we got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we went back to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we lived, there were tenants of ours who lived in small...my father also owned some <span class="INT_SPACE">rental apartments</span> ...<span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And these people who worked for us or were people that worked on the property and so on, were the ones that moved into our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And when we have come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they looked out the <span class="DLF">door</span> or the <span class="DLF">window</span> , and they had seen my mother and I and they looked at us with bewilderment in their eyes. "</span><span class="sentence" id="512">What. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">You're alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">We were told you were all killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And you are alive." </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I mean they themselves had to repeat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">They couldn't believe because they were, apparently, told by the Germans, you help us and you will inherit their goodies, their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , their <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> and everything...all these...these valuables they take away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">You are going to be the beneficiary. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">So when they had our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , they had our <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> and here they saw the two of us come back, they were petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">They would have to give up their...our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">They're...our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="522">Our <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And they were just...they just couldn't believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">They were just so unhappy that they just couldn't hold in their feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And we said, "Don't worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">We don't want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">We don't want...we don't want to even live here. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">We just want to see 1f any of our families came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Did you see any of our families? </span><span class="sentence" id="530">That's all we want to know." </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And, of course, they didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And then little by little, other people trickled back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">And we all were put up in one of the <span class="BUILDING">hotels</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to live there until we found if anybody...any other families come back and decide what we want to do from then on. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">And there were these people coming back and we kept asking everybody, "Did you see my father? </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Did you see my brother? </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Did you see anybody from the family?" </span><span class="sentence" id="537">And the answer was always no. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">So we stayed and stayed and every time somebody came back again and again we ran and again we tried to ask, "Did you see anybody from our family?" </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And the answer was always no. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And this went on for a good couple of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">And nobody would tell us if they had seen them or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">They were all looking for their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">It was the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">We were all in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">We were all looking for our families. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Then after several months, finally somebody had pity on my mother and myself and he told us exactly what happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">He said, "Don't wait for your husband and your father or your son and your brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">They're not coming back." </span><span class="sentence" id="549">I said, "How do you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="550">What do you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Please tell us." </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Begging him, "Please tell us." </span><span class="sentence" id="553">He didn't want to talk at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">He just said, "Go away far from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">Go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">You don't want to stay here. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">They're not coming back." </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Then he finally told us exactly what took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">My father and my brother were together also in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> ...in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="560">And my brother got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">He had just turned 20 like a month before. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And worked very, very hard no matter how sick he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">There was no medical care. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">There was no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">There was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So he got very, very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">And without any food and without medical care, he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And then my father saw his only child, his only son die in front of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And they had heard through rumors that traveled, you know, through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> somehow maybe somebody was assigned to a...a job outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and traveled there with the SS, and they heard a little piece of rumor here about families and what happened to the other people and or somebody else and they got...they paid off...whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Maybe they pulled out the tooth from their mouth, and they gave the gold of the crown to an SS for a little bit of information. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">So whatever way they could, but they got some information. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And the information that they got was that all the women were killed right away as were actually old and young were killed, but they were told that all the women were killed because they felt that they would be of no use to the German and they didn't want them to spend money and food to give it to the women that they were all killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So my father, thinking that we were all dead and he saw his only son die in front of him, he no longer could eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">He no longer had the will power to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">And he too shortly after died. (</span><span class="sentence" id="576">crying) When we heard this, my mother turned to me and she said, "We no longer have anything to live for. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">We have nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Let's take our lives too." (</span><span class="sentence" id="579">crying) And I told her that I had just turned 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I was so young. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I wanted to go on and see if there 1s something beautiful in this world...1f there are some good things in people...if there are some good things in this world to where people lived...not just suffering and ugliness that we have seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I just wanted to go on and see some goodness and some beauty. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">And she told me that if I wanted to go on living her duty as a mother was to go on to help me survive and go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">So after this we just packed those couple of things that were our belongings and we...at this point already while we were staying there waiting for people to come back and hopefully my father and brother and the rest of the family would come back, the...uh...borders between <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> where we could go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> where a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to...we actually wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> where we knew...we heard from people that people that were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> they could get on...uh...to different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> going to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> or toward <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> or to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , and to start a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So we wanted to go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , but the <span class="DLF">border</span> was already closed down because there was already the beginning (clearing throat)...excuse me...of the cold war so the <span class="DLF">border</span> was closed down by <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">So we had some money and some jewelry because before we were taken away that we knew things were bad and my father had taken some jewelry and also he had some dollars, you know, for...actually it was...a lot of people saved these because you never knew, we felt that this was...the war coming and what we would need it for, so instead of having...uh... Hungarian money, they traded...changed it into dollar bills and some jewelry...jewelry was traded into dollar bills, you know, to if need be...1f we have to do anything to be able to possibly pay off whoever could possibly help us, you know, to escape in some way or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">So he dug some <span class="DLF">holes</span> in our <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">We had a very large property and we had some <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> where he...uh...rented it out to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And so he dug several <span class="DLF">holes</span> and different people where he left some jewelry in a little jar and put it in a ground and covered it up and then another sealed jar air tight, put...you know, put some dollar bills in there and hid those just in case. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">We didn't know where, what's going to happen, but just...1f any <span class="NPIP">where</span> we're taken or we can come back at any time and we need something to...to help us survive...whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">We didn't know what to fear, but there 1t was so we should all see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">So when the war was over, and during the nighttime when the...our tenants...the neighbors who moved into our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> were sleeping, we went...my mother and I went with a shovel and a pick and tried to find the little <span class="NPIP">spots</span> where...these different little <span class="NPIP">spots</span> where my father hid these pieces of jewelry and some...not many. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Just...this is one way again. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">He had money in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> so that in case we can possibly get to that, you know, that we can help ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">If not, then this is another way of possibly doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">There were people who...there were an occasional righteous Gentile then as we know it today, which we didn't know the names of, but before we were taken over, there were some people who...who warned some of the Jews that try to escape because things are going to bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And...uh...some of them even hid them. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Others...they were able....some of the people bought for money...big, big money...uh...papers, false papers, the identity of a Christian person that looked somewhat like the person that was buying it. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And they would...uh...go into a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where they would hide where they would not be known and tried to hide that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">And there were still others who were...ran into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> or wherever they could possibly hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And...uh...at that time we didn't even know what was to happen, so my father was trying, in his way, to protect. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">So this was his way that if we ever some how need it, we have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So when we found this jewelry and the money, we paid the Russian guards at the <span class="DLF">border</span> to get us out and get us through into <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> from where we could go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and from there on wherever we can possibly go. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So we paid a good part of this found money and jewelry that..uh...my father hid to get us out of there at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And so we made our way back to...uh...<span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , where most of my mother's family had lived prior to the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Part of <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> is called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Transylvania</span> , which again was <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> ...and back and forth, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And so we stayed there and we hoped that some of the family that lived there would perhaps survive and come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And we stayed there for awhile and one of my mother's brothers and one of her sisters of 8 siblings did come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So we stayed together for awhile and then...uh...I had a marvelous memory at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And I remembered the address of my mother's younger sister who came out on that last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">How I remembered it I don't know, but I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And I wrote a letter...uh...to say that we have survived and if there was any way that they could send us papers so that we could come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> because we could...couldn't possibly live where all this took place, where our neighbors helped the Germans...uh...extradite us and...you know, just so that we can be taken away so they can benefit from our plight and from, you know, our suffering and they can get all our <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> and all of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">So there was no way that we could stay and live there among these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Just...just couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So we had to get away as far as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And the only person that we knew that was alive or we assumed that survived was my mother's sister in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">So when I wrote the letter and I told my aunt that, "That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">There's just the four of survived, you know, from the whole big family. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And if they could send us papers." </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And then they wrote back to us, "By all means. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">They'll do anything and everything, you know, to get us out from there." </span><span class="sentence" id="622">But anything and everything, again, took another 4 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">We had to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and in the <span class="REGION">Munich area</span> where we were in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> and there we applied for a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">But I am sure you know that what it 1s when anybody wants to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="625">You know every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is allowed a certain number of people to come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And...uh...our visa being Czechoslovakian...that's because I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> you know...it was very, very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So we had to wait there from about May of 1945 until March of 1949 to be able to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="628">So we lived in, again, in...what they called the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Not too far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , again in these <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="630">But in this time instead of the...the horrible <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicles</span> that we were sleeping in...uh...we had already <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> to sleep on. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">But, of course, no privacy because...uh...there were hundreds of families in each...each of these little...uh... <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and the only privacy we had was, you know, we were given some...uh...blankets and we would tie strings across and create just a little <span class="INT_SPACE">cubicle</span> like maybe...uh...8 feet by 6 feet or something like that where we had two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> , one for my mother and one for myself and a little, sort of a box or something where we kept the little bit of food that we were given by the UNRRA, the UNRRA* that...uh...was part of the American liberation system there at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And...uh... so that's where we lived for 4 years to wait to get...to go to some <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they would accept us that we could start a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And...uh...March 9th, 1949, is when my mother and I arrived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> where her sister and brother-in-law met us. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And we...practically everybody I think...bent down and kissed the good old American soil because this finally meant freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">We were finally, after all these years, free. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So my aunt and uncle took us with them to their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">They lived near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsburgh</span> , <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> , and we stayed with them for awhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And they wanted us to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">But I was only...I had just turned 18 at the time, and where they lived there were either the all grown-up, older people with grown children who were married and with little babies or people, young married people. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">But there was nobody that was Jewish that was my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And at that point I could not communicate with anybody other than a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">I just couldn't! </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Cause everybody was the enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Everybody was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">They...they didn't go through what we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">They...we were different people. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">It was like...I don't know whether it was they that were green people with...uh...with little horns or we were the ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Couldn't decide which except that we were completely different. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">So I had nothing in common with any of the young *The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">people. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">My aunt and uncle tried to put me back into <span class="BUILDING">school</span> so I learned something and I couldn't do that because I saw all the teachers the way I saw them back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> : anti-Semites and making things miserable and unhappy, so I didn't want to go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">So we stayed there from March until the 4th of July. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And then we went...uh...to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to visit my mother's aunt and cousins who came in the 20s to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And so we visited them just supposedly for a few days, but then we saw that there were a lot more Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , more people my age that I could possibly communicate with and learn from and start a life. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Because I was 18, but I was, in fact, only 13 because those years were nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Those were erased from my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">So I was 13 years old in a 18-year old girl's body. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And I didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I was a frightened little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I could not communicate with anybody except the immediate family, my mother's sister and brother-in-law and their son, their only son. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And then we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">My mother's aunt and her cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I... couldn't go out to the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I was petrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">I was afraid that the Nazis are still out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">I was having nightmares for years and years. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">For many years, I was still reliving everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">The trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , the...the beatings, the killings, the dead people that were taken off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , the...the beatings and the...the dogs that were...uh....released and just jump on the people and...and tear them apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I lived with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Years and years! </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I still live with it, but I don't have these horrible nightmares anymore except occasionally. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">After a day like, for example, today I'm sure I'll have some of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">But this was for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And it was a horrible, horrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">But I did...we did decide to remain in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> because my mother felt that I have a better chance of starting a new life among Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> as opposed to a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">mining town</span> in <span class="REGION">Pennsylvania</span> where there were no Jews my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">So somebody in the family who had a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">clothing factory</span> , took me into his <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and taught me how to use a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And after I worked there for awhile, then I got another job. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">Finally, I was able to get a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">This was my third job in another <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , but I actually got paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">I was paid 25 dollars a week at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And my mother was always very good in caring for people because she was a very, very caring person all her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">If I just think back of her when I was little girl back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , she used to take food and clothing to poor people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> without them knowing where it came from...that it was from our...us children or her best friend's children or from her best friends from themselves, but she would bring the clothing and she would cook for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And she would shop for them and she would go with her little basket on her arm and daily visit poor people and bring things to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">So that even after the war was over and we were for 4 years in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , she went to work in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">Of course, she didn't get paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">You know, this was just a volunteer work. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And she had worked in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and taking care of anybody that had any kind of illness, minor, major, but she was working along with the doctors in the...in this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And then...so when we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , it was only natural for her again to go into something that is caring...something that she can take care of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So she went to work in a <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span> and a <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> and <span class="BUILDING">old age home</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish facility</span> to take care of old women and men. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Again because that meant taking care of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">So after awhile I met a boy that was American-born, who was college graduate and we were dating. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I was finally, after several years, able to get to that point that I was able to go out on dates because when I first started after a year or two being in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and I was still a nervous wreck. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I had a horribly nervous stomach and I was always petrified of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And when I first started to date I would go with...with a young man, maybe to a movie and then to a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And when we were in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , I had to excuse myself several times to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> because I had to throw up because I had such a horribly, nervous stomach because I was still a petrified, little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">So then finally, I think about 19...uh...57, I met this young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And...uh...I seemed...I really liked him a lot and he seemed to like me and we started to date and by that time I was a little bit better as far as being so scared and nervous and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And he kept talking to me that I should go back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">At first I wouldn't hear of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Again because I was still seeing <span class="BUILDING">school</span> like it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">But then he talked and talked and talked and he said, "I'll go with you and I'll sit with you in the classes for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Just try to go back." </span><span class="sentence" id="703">So I was working five days a week in this <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and then I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . [...</span><span class="sentence" id="704">I signed up because I didn't have any papers that I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ...<span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">All those things were lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I had nothing left from my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">So I started to go back...I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">And at first he was coming with me, and then little by little I was calm enough that I was beginning to learn to the point where I did full four years of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> in two years at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So I would get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from work about 6:30 in the evening and my mother would have dinner already because where she worked in this <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> and <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , she would start at 7 o'clock so she would get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> about...uh...3:30, 4 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So she did some shopping on the way <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and then she cooked dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So I had almost a half an hour in which I was able to have dinner and grab my books, walk two blocks to the first <span class="BUILDING">bus stop</span> , then take that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to a second <span class="BUILDING">bus stop</span> , and took the second <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And this was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , the Theodore Roosevelt evening high school, right across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from <span class="BUILDING">Fordham University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And I went there for 2 years, and I was an excellent students. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I got all my grades A's or A minus, and I tried very, very hard and this is...Up the Down Staircase is where I met my husband-to-be. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">He was also a survivor and he too lost at least 90 percent of his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And from a large family, he and two brothers survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">That's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">All his parents, grandparents, all his siblings, there were 8 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">They were all gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And then he asked if he could drive me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And we started to chat on occasion and get to know each other a little bit and within 6 months, we decided to get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">We fell in love. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">We had an awful lot in common, which I felt or which we both felt was very important in a marriage and for...for us to build a life for ourselves again. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And so we did get married. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And 2 years later, we had a little boy who confirmed life again. (</span><span class="sentence" id="726">crying) We won! </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Hitler didn't kill all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">We started a new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">We were very, very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And then 2 years later, we had another little boy, and we were just in <span class="NPIP">seventh heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And we were a family again. (</span><span class="sentence" id="732">crying) My mother was alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">She remarried soon after my first son was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">Somebody in the family knew this gentlemen who lost his wife who also came out to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> in the 20s. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And he lost his wife and he was alone and he was a very nice person and he had his own business for many years and at this point he was retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And he was lonely. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">And some members of the family knew him. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And then when he met my mother and they saw what a lovely caring person she is, they wanted them to meet and they got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">And they were very happy for about 5 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">And there Florida...were in... were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> for a wedding on his side of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And when they came back from the wedding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hotel room</span> , he had a heart attack and died in front of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So she had to see the second time around. (</span><span class="sentence" id="743">crying) So this poor woman who lost her parents, sisters, brothers, lost her husband and her son had to go through this again. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">The only thing that I think kept her alive after that was my two sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">She had to have something to live for cause otherwise she could not have made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">She was in very bad shape for 2, 3 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">I mean very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Very, very bad! </span><span class="sentence" id="749">She moved back with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">At this point we already bought a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a two-family house where we had the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> upstairs rented. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">So when she couldn't be alone, we asked these people that lived with us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> to find another <span class="NPIP">place</span> because we had to have...give my mother a <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . (</span><span class="sentence" id="752">crying) Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">She moved in with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">She has her <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> upstairs and we were downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">We were just one family. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">My mother was working part-time, and I was...I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">At this point I already loved <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">At this point I wanted to see beautiful things, and I wanted to learn about the world, about good people, about good things. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">There are...there are some good things in this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And I went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to study interior decorating. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And so I was able to create and help create beautiful things. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I went to <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I went to <span class="DLF">gardens</span> , <span class="DLF">flower gardens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I took my children to the ballet and to the opera and I taught them everything...showed them everything beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And we lived a very happy life at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">We worked very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">And then my mother finally stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">She took care of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and the cooking and when the boys came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , she was there to meet them. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And I was working and I would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the evening, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">My husband would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we were again living a normal family life. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And, as the boys, were growing my mother got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">One Saturday morning as I was going...about to go to work and I came down from upstairs where, you know, we already had moved into a larger <span class="BUILDING">home</span> at this point in a very nice <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And we were on our way really to a nice life and she moved with us to this new nice...nicer home. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And then one morning as I was getting ready to go to work and she was already downstairs and I was coming down from my <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> and I heard some horrible moaning of pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And I got scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">I didn't know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">And I ran down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and I went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and she was sitting there completely doubled over with some excruciating pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I didn't know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">So I...uh...called up her doctor and when I told her what happened, he said to put her into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and take her straight to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where he'll meet us. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">After lot's of tests and everything, they discovered that she had cancer of the colon. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">For 2 years she was suffering with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">I took her to <span class="BUILDING">Columbia Presbyterian Hospital</span> in New York, which was considered one of the very best. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I found the very best...uh...specialist in this type of cancer who performed surgery and he found the oncologist who treated her afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And I took her twice a week, once to her regular doctor for a checkup, and once a week to the oncologist. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">For 2 years she suffered like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">She passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">She passed away in 1978. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So we were back to four of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">And the same week when we buried her, my two sons went away to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">So it was a tough time again. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">Mourning my mother, having the boys go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">But life went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">After a certain period of time, I went back to work, continuing...trying to survive and continue to make a life again. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And my sons went and they graduated from <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , both of the <span class="DLF">computer line</span> , and one is working for IBM on the shuttle program, and the other one is also in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span> , but he...he started for...with MCR, and now he 1s with another major company up in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And our younger son lives...well, to back track a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Uh...After my husband was with a company for 22 years as the manager who...that was owned by two brothers-in-law who were hardly ever there because they were able to get away because my husband was a very, very responsible man and he worked very hard to keep the business running as well as he could possibly go, and they were very happy with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And he was with this company for 22 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And then one of the brother-in-laws reached the age of...1nto the mid 70s, and he felt that he was...he had enough and he wanted to be out. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And so...uh...he...my husband went with this new company, but he wasn't very happy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">So it was time to make another change, and at this point he had cousins in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> , <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , where he was a pharmacist and...uh...he kept talking to us to come down because life is much quieter and nicer and business opportunities are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">He asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">We did come down on our vacation and within days decided it's time to make the next change. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">So we moved down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> where we are living now. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Our younger son lived...lived about an hour's drive from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">He works at the <span class="BUILDING">space center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And...uh...we see him and talk to him very often, and our younger son remained up north and we see him only about 2, 3 times a year, but talk to him continue...all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And so we are a very close family even though we are not always together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="808">QUESTION:  I think at this point, this seems a perfect finish to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I want to say thank you for being here and doing this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="810">ANSWER:  The only thing if I could add, I would like to. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">What I do now, although I work full time, is that I belong to a small group of people that's called the Holocaust Survivors Group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Houston</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="812">QUESTION:  Go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">ANSWER:  It's alright?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">QUESTION:  Go on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">ANSWER:  And that our small group of us from this particular organization that go to different <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and talk to the young people and tell them what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Tell them about the Holocaust, our experiences, and tell them to read about the past and learn about it, and try in their lifetime as they go, that they can stop from things like this from happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And it's up to the young people...that today's generation to prevent something like this from happening again. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">So I go from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and from organization to organization and from <span class="BUILDING">church</span> to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and talk to all the groups and not just I, but this nucleus of about a dozen people to share our plight and our experiences and to ask them and to teach them to be aware and be watchful and care about people. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And when somebody is being persecuted for whatever reason to help and to speak up and we just go on and try to remember the past and hope to make a better life for the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="820">QUESTION:  Thank you very much. </span>
