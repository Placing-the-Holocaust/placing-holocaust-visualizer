QUESTION:  Let's stay with the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> a little bit and talk about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">Tell me, did Harry Alexander 2 October 11, 1995 Page 2 you work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> we worked in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ten hours a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And they were trying to build a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> through the <span class="REGION">Sahara</span> called the Transcontinental. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">Of course, they never succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">The conditions, they were very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">We had 75 grams by the day, 2 cups of water and the heat that came up to 110 degrees. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">At night it was so cold our teeth would chatter. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We had no blankets, we had nothing to sleep on. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Like | said, we slept in the <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> , they were made for ten people. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Fifty people in the <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">We were eaten up with lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">We dealt with desert rats, snakes, scorpions, malaria, malnutrition, beatings. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">The camp commander would come in who was a drunkard and a sadist. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">He would come in every day, pick out ten men and beat them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Tie them to a pole, naked, and whip them with his horse whip, the whip he used for his horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Just to show the rest of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">We were about 4,000 in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">To show the rest of us what would happen if we tried to escape or if we didn't behave ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Or if we refused to work, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Infraction of the rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">This is going to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">We were buried up to our heads in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> , you couldn't move the head. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">There were a lot of bugs in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> , they would bite. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">We wouldn't move, if we did they would crack our heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The guards that would guard us were Spa-hees (ph), called Spa-hees (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="26">The was the Arab elite troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">They were very brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">It was a brutal camp and | say, we survived, we really didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , 330 or 340 were still alive from 4,000 when we were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So after a Harry Alexander 3 October 11, 1995 Page 3 while, we got use to the punishment, we got use to taking very little water, we got use to taking, eating very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We utilized, the rats we use to eat, we use to catch and eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Snakes we would eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Dogs that passed by, wandering perhaps, that lost they're way into the <span class="DLF">barb wire</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">We would eat them. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Anything edible, just to stay alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">We got use to all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">It's amazing how people get use to these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">We always had hope of getting out some day, of surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">But more or less, we talked ourselves into that hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">We never didn't really have hope anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">After two years, you begin to lose your hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">The work was very tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We had to carry sand from a mile down the <span class="DLF">road</span> to the <span class="DLF">desert</span> , back to the <span class="DLF">desert</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We had to clean the dunes up so they could lay the <span class="DLF">tracks</span> for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">But a day later or two days later, they went blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">The mist-al (ph) it came, mist-al (ph) is a sandstorm, and put the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">dunes</span> right back where we took it away from. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So it was a hopeless situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">We walked along and we sunk into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sand</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">We got beaten, the guards use to be on horseback and they would whip us with their, wnat do you call these? </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Whips, there. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Then we got up, either got up or died. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Like a friend of mine said, who was before me, he says, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="53">| can never get use to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I'm trying very hard but | can never get use to this life. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">It was said in humor but | never forgot that phrase. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">| can never get use to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Well, he died too, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">They would take us toa from the French Foreign Legion. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And any infraction of the rules we would spend 14 days at the <span class="BUILDING">fort</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Now, 14 days meant you hang on your arms Harry Alexander 4 October 11, 1995 Page 4 every other day for 24 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">We had very little food, we had very little water and beatings every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And you did good if you came out alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">| was in there a few times. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">It was a bad situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But we survived it, a few of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  Who else was in the camp with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp?</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Mostly Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">But we had arsons, we had people from the brigade, the international brigade, from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">The Tale-mon-brigada (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="71">From the civil war in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And we had many nationalities in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Many languages were spoken. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And we sort of stuck together. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">We were all in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and we sort of had people in charge, that told us what to do and how to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We helped one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">If one was sick, he is weak, all of us gave him a bit of bread, crumb of bread or a drink of water or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Because they could get no rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We tried to save aS many as we could, help as many as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">There was only so much we could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">It was a real <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">You cannot describe this <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , you were in there for two years. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We thought it would never end, but it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">We came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">They took us, we were of course in very bad condition, physical and mentally, psychologically. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And they took us to a <span class="BUILDING">prison hospital</span> to get us back on our feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And then it started. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">| had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">| had no family, | had no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , | had no <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">| just didn't know what to do or where to go, now that | was free and back on my feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">| just bided my time. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">| was about 22, 23 years old, so they asked me, | could have gone any <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Is there anywhere in the free world, we Harry Alexander 9) October 11, 1995 Page 5 will take you. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">You now are a free man. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Well, once | felt better, | felt | had to do something, one more thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Get the back, go into the army, which | did. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">At that time, of course, you must understand, | had a lot of resentment, a lot of hate in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Towards the people that did all this to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They took my family, my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They took away my youth, they took away a part of my life, the best part of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My education. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">So, | joined the British Eighth Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">| couldn't speak a word of English but that didn't stop me. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">| eventually learned how to handle a gun and | spent 4 years and 3 months in the British Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Two more years in <span class="REGION">Africa</span> , that was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">They sent me to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">war office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and they attached me to the army intelligence. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">By now | could speak English, | could speak French, | could speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">They send me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , <span class="BUILDING">intelligence school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Gave me a course and sent me to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they said they needed people to speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And they sent me to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">| went to Half-ort (ph), Field Marshall Montgomery's headquarters. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They gave me another schooling and | did the job, whatever they wanted me to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">| hunted war criminals for over 18 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">My job was, they gave me a picture, that's the man or woman you want and we went out to get them. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Most of the time we succeeded, we caught some in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , some in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="117">We could travel anyplace, do anything, go anywhere, fly over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And we got most of them but our job was to arrest them, to bring them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> would take care of them, they had their particulars and their Harry Alexander 6 October 11, 1995 Page 6 investigators and we translated the statements and that was the end of our job. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">What happened afterwards, we don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">| did that for 18 months and didn't, of course, we were a bit rough, we were a bit hard on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Because we traveled three at a time, a crew of three. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Between us we spoke ten languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And every one of us had a story to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">It wasn't a good one. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So we, we were the ones they couldn't bribe. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">We were the one's that had no pity. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We were the one's that didn't understand their plight. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And we were the one's that went out and did the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">No matter what, no matter what it took. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Like, we caught one worker who killed many women and children, | will never forget this. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We caught them in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> and him, he was hiding in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">back oven</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">We went, four o'clock in the morning, we went in there and we told him, he wouldn't come out, we told him, he has a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Either we would put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">back oven</span> on and burn him to death or we will shoot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">That was more of a choice than he gave our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Our people had no choice at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They just killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They just gassed them or hanged them or burned them alive, and shot them and starved them. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">We gave him a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">In fact, we gave him time to talk to his maker. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">This is the kind of situations we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">We were all in agreement with the way we did things and how we did it, and after 18 months they called me into the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and just said, we are as bad as the Germans, we are no better. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We have to rebuild. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">We have to be better than they are. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">We have to show them how civilized people live, how civilized people do things. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">| looked at the Harry Alexander 7 October 11, 1995 Page 7 captain, | said, are we uncivilized? </span><span class="sentence" id="147">He says, well, the way you do things is not just the right thing anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">The war is ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">We can't go on doing this anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">God will pay them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">| said, with my help. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And I'll tell you what he says, you've had enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We discharge you. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Send you to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and you'll start a whole, new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The war is over. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And | said to him, the war may be over for you, the war isn't over for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And as far as starting a new life, how do you do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="158">How do you start with no family, no <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , no <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , no money, no trade, no skill, no education? </span><span class="sentence" id="159">How do you start a new life? </span><span class="sentence" id="160">They had taken all this away from me and they haven't given me, any of them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">How do you start a new life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  When you were investigating war criminals, were you also trying to find out what had happened to your own family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They gave me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> and | could travel into <span class="REGION">British zones</span> and the American Zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="165">| traveled for three weeks, | went to one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Nothing from my three sisters, three brothers, my mother, my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">| came back empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">But | have never stopped looking to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">| still write to organizations and <span class="NPIP">places</span> , but there is very little hope, if there is any at all, to find any of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">| don't really have any hope anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I've been looking for fifty years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  What about just finding information about people that you knew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">So, | went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">What other <span class="NPIP">place</span> could | go? </span><span class="sentence" id="178"><span class="COUNTRY">France</span> wasn't Harry Alexander 8 October 11, 1995 Page 8 very good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="179"><span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> wasn't very good to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="180"><span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> wasn't, no body helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So, | went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And that's were my life started, my so-called new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">There | roomed with another guy, | couldn't afford it on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And | waited, | didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">As | said, | had to experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It was the first time | had lived on my own. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">| didn't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go for lunch or dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">| didn't have a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , any <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, | had no body to talk to. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">At least in the army, you have some people, some friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Here | had no one. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">| was all on my own, all alone in a strange <span class="REGION">land</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">A <span class="REGION">land</span> that didn't even want me. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Let's face it. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">If you don't speak English like the English do, you're an outsider. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">They don't like you and they show it. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">| had no other <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, what could | do? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">| got into a lot of fist fights. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">| was bitter. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">| was disappointed. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">| was hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Inexperienced to stand on my own two feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">For a year, | wandered around. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Did odd jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And then | decided I'd go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I'm going to leave it all behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">All the nightmares. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">All the bad experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">All the bad times. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">| get all out of my system, | want to start a whole new life somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">It can't get any worse than it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">What do | have to lose? </span><span class="sentence" id="212">| was able to get the money together. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">| got a visa immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">| went to the <span class="BUILDING">American Consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> and | got the visa immediately.</span></p>
