ANSWER:  Yes, Just prior to the liberation I was 1n so-called [indecipherable] which means in English, a <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">I was lying there with some broken ribs, which I received on the last beating that I got at the hands of the meister, the supervisor from the <span class="BUILDING">airplane factory</span> in which I w -- slaved. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">And at that time the allied forces were closing on the - around our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittenberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">We were not really sure who were they, but we were -- we were subjected to bombardments and the Germans closed us in the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and the -- the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were locked and the <span class="DLF">windows</span> were covered, and we were not let out to work, and as well with the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Since this came so rapidly, they did not have time to dispose of us, because the plan was to somehow eradicated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with the inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I was brought from the <span class="INT_SPACE">sick bay</span> to the main <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> when they closed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And the following day, or two days later, one of the girls looked through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , the -- the shutter, and she have seen that the <span class="BUILDING">towers</span> where the German soldiers were usually with -- watching us, ar -- they were absent, nobody was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">So they decided to break the <span class="DLF">door</span> open and run. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And the ones who could, ran to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">They brought us some very silly foods, margarine, one egg, I think, a couple of potatoes and we stayed for awhile there. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">We had very mixed emotions because we didn’t know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">However, we decided that the safest thing for us would be to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> since it was abandoned by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">This was the supposedly moment of the liberation, and we didn’t feel liberated yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">It was very strange feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">We went across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , my friends helped me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">QUESTION:  You couldn’t walk?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  Iam -- I -- I walked, because I -- the human need to survive is so great that you summon all your energy to -- to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So I lived with this pain, and they helped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And they -- as a matter of fact they say, Blanka, another day, another day and we will be free. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And we crossed the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">There was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in which the commandant lived from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , with a <span class="DLF">garden</span> , lovely flowers which I envied when I passed by and saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We went <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , it was abandoned as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And there were, I think, seven of us, and one girl has -- had a mother with her yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And they brought the food, and somebody was preparing the food, and all of a sudden the commandant came back with a gun, cocked the gun, aimed at the group of us and of course we were petrified, we thought that’s the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And this big, strong man with the gun was afraid of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And he backed out and disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">At that moment we thought the safest thing would be to leave his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and go towards the fire, because this indicated that whoever is fighting, is a liberator.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">QUESTION:  How many of you at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">ANSWER:  I don’t know what happened, but we split. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I was in a group of five. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Two of the girls were helping me, and the five of us were running. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We passed a <span class="DLF">field</span> , 1t was <span class="DLF">street</span> or a <span class="DLF">field</span> , there were two young men there, and they joined us. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">These were two Polish men who worked there during the war as hands at the <span class="DLF">farms</span> because <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> needed laborers, and they joined us. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Since we were from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , we spoke Polish, so the seven of us reached the <span class="DLF">front line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Unbelievable, unbelievable sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">The first soldiers that we -- soldier that we saw was of Asiatic origin, I believe, some Mongol maybe, with the eyes that make seem that he’s Asiatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And he was with the dirty uniform, filthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And we kissed his boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">I remember that moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And he motioned with his hands for us to go in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">We went in the back, they told us that we can help ourselves to food, which was in a barrel, there were herrings. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">We ate some of the herrings, we got very sick from it because the bodies were empty -- the stomachs, rather, were empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And there was no water because the pipes weren’t working. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So -- but we were pretty sick, in pretty bad shape.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="952">ANSWER:  Yes, I -- I learned so -- a very powerful lesson, [Il tell you what. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">Yad Vashem, when I went in, I was in the <span class="BUILDING">gallery</span> , af -- that was only once, and so many years ago, and I looked in the somber, dark cham -- chamber, with the names of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I -- I broke down, I cried, because I thought of the people who did not survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And when I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yad Vashem</span> , and I opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and I walked out, and that was very sunny day, and there was this <span class="DLF">street</span> with the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , and -- called the Avenue of Righteous Gentiles, with the name of the Righteous Gentiles underneath each <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , this was my greatest impact of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , because I was not aware, up through that moment, that there were Gentiles who did help. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">This was the very first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Nobody told me about that before, I don’t know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">That people did help, and people paid the supreme sacrifice, that people cared. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">I thought nobody did. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And this, in itself, motivated me to speak and to mention this fact in most of my speeches, that there were people who were righteous, that there were people who cared, in spite of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">It was tremendous impact. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I always mention this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Let’s talk about your work then. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">When did you begin -- when did you begin to speak out publicly in a more cons -- sort of in a more concentrated fashion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="966">ANSWER:  Well, I became -- I became more reassured in my English, and I -- and my daughter also said that I have something that I should share with people, that a -- maybe -- she calls this a gift, that I am able to communicate and impart of myself, and -- and present in such a way that it will be not offending to some people, but rather, instructional. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And I try to do my very best to -- to fulfill this. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">I go -- I used to go to every <span class="NPIP">place</span> that ask me, anybody who was willing to listen, to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , and <span class="BUILDING">churches</span> , and public -- not really public, but groups of people that wanted to hear me, and I was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And when I started to see the results and the letters that I was getting, this became the impetus even more so, that I was able to reach some of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">QUESTION:  What -- what did people say? </span><span class="sentence" id="971">Say a little bit more about what kind of different groups you went to, and what -- what were some of the responses that you got.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="972">ANSWER:  Well, as an example, I can give you for instance the Navy intelligence unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">This unit is comprised of very young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">And I always tell it -- I have to repeat myself that if they’re in intelligence unit, they must be fairly intelligent. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">I have to say this because -- but they are also, at the same time, are very gung-ho, very -- how did you let yourself to -- to go this way, and to be done to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">They cannot perceive that the circumstances under which we were, were so outrageous, we were not only persecuted and beaten and starved by the Germans, but the Polish population was sort of enjoying it. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">Helping, and not helping us. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">We tried to -- to -- if we could get a gun smuggled to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">Me -- I understood first in Yad Vashem that there were some Polish people who did help, but up til that moment, I did not know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">There’s a whole <span class="DLF">wall</span> of people names that did help, and I was in a shock, because I didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">My love was concentrated on the country of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> because what -- what they did, as a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , as a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="982">They saved about 95 percent of their Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And I -- each time -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Diego</span> there 1s a little place in a <span class="DLF">Balboa park</span> that has that little -- a <span class="NPIP">Danish place</span> , and German place, and <span class="NPIP">Polish place</span> with the flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">On Sunday they’re open. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Whenever I walk to the little <span class="BUILDING">Danish place</span> , and there 1s a book that you write, I say thank you, <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="986">They don’t know why and who and what, but it makes me feel good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="987">QUESTION:  So you are trying to communicate to these little macho young people that --
ANSWER:  I try to communicate and you have no idea what a tremendous response I’ve got. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">Now this was, I would say from the entire group, there was one Jewish woman lieutenant, and one half-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">That’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">They were magnificent, all of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">They listen intently, they made sort of mental notes. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">They ask question after my presentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">They listen to my explanation. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">I told them, yes, it’s easy to say, but the circumstances were such, we were completely helpless. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">I said, do you know how many people committed suicide because they couldn’t do anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="996">The world didn’t listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">They -- there was a Polish representative who -- who reached <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , Jan Karski, he tried to tell them. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">They didn’t want to listen, they didn’t want to believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">So we were -- if the war would have been cut by a year, they could save God knows how many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">They never bombed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that were leading to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">So --
QUESTION:  Did you tell them about s-small acts of resistance, as -- such as your -- your own?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1002">ANSWER:  I did -- my -- absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">This -- this was a hit, because this sabotage, in their eyes, was a tremendous act of courage, which it was, because we risked death at every moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">But at that point we didn’t care anyway, because we thought we will die anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1005">QUESTION:  This is a story, just for our listeners, a story that Blanka has told in the videotaped interview, when she was working in an <span class="BUILDING">aircraft factory</span> , when she committed acts of sabotage, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1006">ANSWER:  Ye-Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">While -- excuse me, while I was riveting -- joining parts of the wings of the p -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> , I noticed a small notation in a Russian script, done by the Russian prisoners of war who worked at night shift, 1-1instructing us what to do and how to sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">When we joined the two <span class="NPIP">parts</span> , to leave a little bit opening at every third or fourth rivet, hoping that the force of <span class="DLF">air</span> will force this rivet out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">And this was tremendous, tremendous thing [indecipherable] us, and -- for us, and the -- the young intelligence officers were absolutely s -- mesmerized by this story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1010">QUESTION:  Yeah, we should -- unfortunately we should stop here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And this is the end of tape two, side B, interview with Blanka Rothschild. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Blanka Rothschild. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">This is tape number three, side A. So, I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the response from the Naval intelligence unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">Just maybe elaborate a little bit more on what they said, and -- and --
ANSWER:  Well, when I spoke, it was very quiet, they were very intent on listening, they were very polite. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And when I finished, I’ve seen few tears, I must say I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">Because they were -- majority were men, but there a couple of women lieutenants, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">And then there was a question answer period, and the qu -- two questions which very frequently come up were asked there as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And one of them was how did we permit this to happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">And of course, the answer is very incomprehensible to them, but I try my very best to tell them that the circumstances under which we were kept completely prevented us from doing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">There were a couple of revolts in some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , I believe, small, that the people were able to get some guns, some ammunition, and even the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> had revolt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz ghetto</span> , for instance, where I was, it was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">We were surrounded by very anti-Semitic population. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">We could not get any gun for the life of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">We were -- as a matter of fact, the people were rejoicing seeing our terrible situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">So -- and we were starved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">Now, if you are starved, you don’t have strength to pick up anything, how can you fight? </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">That’s why people were committing suicides, a lot of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Besides the spirit was completely broken when you saw members of your family and children being taken away, and knew -- by that time you already knew that they were going to <span class="NPIP">places</span> where they were disposed of like a -- like a vermin. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">The second question that very often I am asked 1s if I can forgive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">I believe that I even spoke about it on my videotape, and this question has two prongs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">The people who committed these horrible acts, and destroyed human beings, murder human beings, no I cannot forgive them, and I never will. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">But the other people, the other German people, who did not participate, who were born after the war, who help, like Jehovah Witnesses, there is nothing to forgive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">They did not do anything wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">So as I said, there are two parts of this question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1035">QUESTION:  When you go to -- you go to other <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> for instance, what -- ho-how do you sort of experience a response there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1036">ANSWER:  Well, when I go to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , I try to tailor myself to the audience that I’m speaking to. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">If 1 am in a class of let’s say, junior high students, who are young children, I always tell them to close their eyes in the beginning of my presentation, because what they see in front of them is an elderly lady who has some problems walking, and they cannot relate too much to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">So when I ask them to close their eyes and try for a moment to visualize me as they are now, a-as I once was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">I was a young girl, and I had shared the same interests as they do now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">I was thinking of my friends, and I was thinking of boys, and of secrets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">So I was young, and I was fairly good looking, and I didn’t have any other worries as -- if I g-got enough weekly allowance to buy myself something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">But of course, now I’m older. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">So I -- I try to sort of bring them a little bit up to my level, and lower myself to their level and I go from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">So when I speak about us as young girls in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they try to -- try to bring this to the previous saying, that oh yes, I was once young, and how did I got into the situation? </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">They listen intently, and they ask question afterwards, and they write me letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">I’m a recipient of many, many hu-hundreds of letters, some of them which I sent to the archives, to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1047">QUESTION:  In the end of this interview, maybe you can read a few excerpts from such letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">I have some, yeah -- not -- not right now, maybe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1049">ANSWER:  All right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1050">QUESTION:  But -- but later on, so --
ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">There is a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Diego</span> , Saint Madeline’s, and I spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">I was invited there three times already, to different classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And I said to the teacher, but I’m repeating myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">She said, but what you think the teachers do every year, they repeat themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">And it’s a different class. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">As a matter of fact, some lay- sisters came from other classes, were standing at the <span class="DLF">door</span> to listen, and -- and the receptionist always [indecipherable] they -- they -- they ask questions, they bright, they have -- they show that they have good schooling, and this is very rewarding to me, because if I can reach couple of them, then th -- I accomplished something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1057">QUESTION:  Do you think the impact, or the impression of a survivor in -- 1n person, talking about it, is a different one than reading it from -- 1-1n books or seeing films?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1058">ANSWER:  Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">And this is why I drive myself even though physically it’s getting exceedingly diffing -- difficult for me to do so, because I am disabled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">But I -- I -- I still try and -- when I tell them that they will be able in the future to say to some -- maybe their own children, I heard the story from the mouth of actual survivor, not from a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And there is an impact there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">And the children, especially the -- the brighter ones, they do respond to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">They react. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And that makes me happy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1065">QUESTION:  Can you think of an example?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1066">ANSWER:  Yes, I can think of the example of -- which is the letter that --
QUESTION:  Yeah [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  -- from the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1067">QUESTION:  I -- I looked for the --
ANSWER:  And th-this was a girl in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , 1n a very affluent part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">San Diego</span> , who has written me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1068">QUESTION:  Which one is it, this one?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1069">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">And my --
QUESTION:  Oh, your glasses?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1071">ANSWER:  I had them --
QUESTION:  [indecipherable] they’re just looking for -- over there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1072">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">The girl who has written me, and I thought that was very significant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">As a matter of fact I sent a copy of it to Dr. Ringleheim in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . “</span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Dear Mrs. Rothschild. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">Thank you for coming to our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and telling us about the way it was for you in the World War II. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">It meant a lot to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">My views on white supremacy and hating people of other ethnic backgrounds were changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">Your presentation helped me realize a lot of things that I never even thought of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">I felt terrible to think my boyfriend of a year and a half, worshipped the man, the same kind of a man that broke your back, or hit your grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">I’m very sorry for many things I have said and done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">I feel ashamed, ashamed for the SS tattooed on my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">There are a lot of young people such as me who never even stopped to think of the real terrors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">I know you made a great impression on my mind, and I had stopped to think of the things that I have said and done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">Sincerely, C. Hale.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">Now, the letter is grammatically very poorly written, especially for a <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> student in an affluent area. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">However, I made a dent in her way of thinking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">I made her think, and that is extremely important to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">She thought well enough of it to sit down and write to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">That means that she- she some -- some sort of changed occurred in her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">Now, even s -- even small change. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">If she asks me to please continue speaking to people like her, that means that I have done some good.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1093">QUESTION:  You have spoken now for about 30 years?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1094">ANSWER:  About, just about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1095">QUESTION:  About [inaudible]
ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1096">QUESTION:  What is the price that you pay for that role?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1097">ANSWER:  The price that I pay is my health. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">It is getting extremely difficult for me, especially when I have to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">But I do not want to s-s -- keep that occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">If I’m invited -- for instance, I was invited to <span class="BUILDING">Duke University</span> twice already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And I went the first time a-absolutely on my cost, because I do not charge for my speaking, I feel this is my obligation, my obligation to -- to those who cannot speak for themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">The second time I was invited, and I was -- I was provided with a fare and a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , which helped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">But of course, nothing for the speaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">And I received a booklet, beautifully done, because I spoke for two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">The first day it was in a large <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> which was filled to capacity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">Besides the students, there was also some contingent of faculty and ministers, couple ministers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And the kids who came little bit late, were sitting on the aisles, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , because all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">And the second day I spoke in a <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">This 1s a special course on Holocaust at <span class="BUILDING">Duke Institute</span> at this year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">And the teacher of the course, Miss [indecipherable] who is Polish, was kind enough to send me a booklet comprised of the letters, he-headed by her own letter, and in which she said that she gave the students a task of instead of a final, to write a letter responding to Mrs. Rothschild. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And I have the letters, and this just very special to me, and a copy of it I send -- she sent me two copies, and the second copy I sent to Dr. Ringleheim at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1112">QUESTION:  Yeah, at the end of this interview we will read a -- a few excerpts from -- from that booklet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">But let me ask you also, when I ask you about the price, does it get easier to speak about it as the years go on, or do you still have a -- bad nights before or after, and bad dreams?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1114">ANSWER:  I -- Lusually have, no matter how many years I will speak, there is apprehension before I go, because I don’t know what kind of audience or reception I will receive, and there is sleeplessness that is usually associated with it, and it -- it bothers me a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">And then after I speak, and I come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , even though it was very good reception, I always have some thoughts that I omitted something important, that I should have said this or that, and that was of major importance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">But there is a sense of accomplishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1117">QUESTION:  Have you ever mistrusted your memory?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1118">ANSWER:  I made couple of mistakes, even on my video. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">I tried to -- to tell Dr. Joan at the very end, when I speak of my liberation, on the interviewer asked me the day I was liberated, I said, April 26, 1944, and it was 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">That’s one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And another one was oh -- of -- I get mixed up with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">I -- I just cannot say the right -- maybe this is this -- the terrible pain that I have in my heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And also, once I made a mistake on --in my speaking, when I talked about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bittenberg</span> , which 1s the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that I slaved in <span class="BUILDING">Arado airplane factory</span> , and I said that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> on which <span class="DLF">door</span> the Martin Luther affixed the 1905 thesis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And in one speech I said Martin Luther King. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And they couldn’t take that King out, because it was too late.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1126">QUESTION:  Well, we have corrected it here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">Do you do anything to -- just to -- to ha -- to stimulate your memory? </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">Is it -- 1s 1t fading, or is it still very strong, except for now and then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">ANSWER:  A cert -- no, certain things are very deeply engraved on my memory, that I will always repeat it, and they stay with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">But many things slowly start fading away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">And that’s why it’s so important that I did speak for all these years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">Yes, some things I -- as I said previously, I try to erase from my memory, like the faces of my tormentors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">But some -- dates, for instance, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">And I don’t remember what I wore when I left that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">I called my friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> who was also in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> she’s, don’t you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">Then I -- I ask somebody about something and she said, Blanka, but I was with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And I didn’t remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">So the age takes over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">That’s why I’m speeding with my speaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1141">QUESTION:  Did you ever go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1142">ANSWER:  I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> only after I was liberated, and once I left after the bad reception, I decided never, ever to come back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">I was back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> couple of times, because the German government recognized that they did impair my health quite badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">They crippled me, and the condition is worsening with age, so a couple of times I was granted a so-called cour. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">I was in a <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> that the doctor treated me, and I received treatments, however what they gave me was not sufficient to cover all the expenses like flight and the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> , so I had to stop going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for that reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">The treatments were wonderful, much superior to the ones that I’m getting here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">I’m going now to, so far, couple of times to <span class="BUILDING">Canestoga spa</span> , which has some <span class="INT_SPACE">bath</span> , and they are not quite the same quality and value. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">But it does help me, so I do go there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1149">QUESTION:  You never received compensation for slave labor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1150">ANSWER:  Not so far, I -- I’m receiving a gesundheitshan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">I’m receiving a m-monthly rent for my broken health, but now there 1s a class action for the slave labor and I filled the papers, and I hope that I will be able to -- after all, I worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz ghetto</span> for a few years, in a -- 1s -- not <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , but this was establishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">I was working making sweaters for Germans, they needed for the winters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">And then we were working on some <span class="BUILDING">cement place</span> , making blocks for the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that were being destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And of course in the <span class="BUILDING">airplane factory</span> until the liberation in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1155">QUESTION:  When you went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , what was your impression then of the country of the Germans? </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">Was there something that stays with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Conversations you have had, things you have seen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1158">ANSWER:  Well, when I went there, I used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">In the <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> there were many people who were coming for their vacation, and they were at the -- their very best, at leisure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And if they ever ask me anything -- not a person that I met knew about anything, so they were quite innocent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">They did not know about the atrocities, they did not hear about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">Anyway, the people that I met never, with the exception of the old lady in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> after the war, who admitted that she was Nazi and so were all her friends, the doctor and the personnel in the <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> were very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">After all, they were being paid for it, and the people that I met there were friendly with me, but then I met couple of Dutch people there who come in for the same treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">And there were a couple of people even from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> that I met there, and the local population I -- I -- I made friends with a man who made me brace, because I have to wear back brace, I just put it on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And in the beginning he -- his reaction was not too friendly, but after awhile when he got to know me, he became very friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">He and his wife visited us in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">He made me brace, for which he was paid by the German government, and he made me a brace as a gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1168">QUESTION:  Do you think his original unfriendliness had -- he was just a grumpy person, or did it have something to do with who you were? </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">Not you as a person, but that you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1170">ANSWER:  I really couldn’t put my finger on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">He was not too intelligent man, but he was a very good businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">So he knew how to -- how to work for the government because he was doing this type of work for war amputees and -- and the braces, not too many people nowadays know this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">There’s no industry for making this type of braces, so he was just about one of very few in all of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and he cashed on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">In the beginning why he wasn’t too friendly, well I was somebody strange, and maybe he thought that I resented him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">I had to go to him from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Kissingen</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schweinhold</span> on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but the next time when he saw me and he -- he met me, and he sort of liked me, he came with his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to pick me up, and spare me the ride on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1195">QUESTION:  -- when was that, and what --
ANSWER:  When I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , prior to being on the <span class="REGION">west coast</span> , we lived for 20 years in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , we -- I contacted the -- The Quaker Society, American Friend Society, and I ask them to send a couple of students for a holiday for a dinner, because I wanted people from different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> to learn about us, and I thought that one on one, it’s the best way to learn about people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">And one day the lady from The Friend Society called me and asked me if I would mind if she would send a German girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">And I said, by all means send her to me, let her see me as I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">And she and a Dutch girl came together to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">She was in the beginning very shy, and very sort of frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">But as the things progressed, and the dinner, we became quite friendly, and she left as a friend, and that was an accomplishment. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">Yes, I think that the young people should try to reach and meet, maybe some survivors, or people who- whose family suffered to -- to form a common bond. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">It’s very important when people try to understand each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">After all, we are all individuals, we are all different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">We have different points of view, religions, cultural background, but we are all human beings, so if we try to overcome our prejudices, and reach a hand and listen, then the world would be much better, much better off.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1208">ANSWER:  Honestly I -- I am -- I am at times pessimistic, because I don’t see much progress in many parts of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">I’m afraid that the human race did not learn the powerful lessons that Holocaust and the previous genocides provided. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">They are still going on around the globe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And it’s not only <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , but it’s in <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> , it’s in <span class="COUNTRY">Sri Lanka</span> , it’s in yugo -- it’s in <span class="COUNTRY">Ireland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Bo-Both people are Christian, only different denomination and they hate one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">I -- this is the greatest divisor of people, religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And if people would really, truly were religious in their hearts, they would find a way to -- to find this common bond, and the link. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">But truthfully, when I see the situation in <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , I -- I am not too optimistic, sadly.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1220">QUESTION:  -- and then we’ll read a few ex-excerpts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1221">ANSWER:  Yes, on -- my last speaking enda -- engagement was at <span class="BUILDING">Duke University</span> , and I spoke twice, one day to the third <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> of student and some faculty and ministers, and the next day I spoke before a class which was instituted this year, specifically on Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">The class is small si -- consisting of a teacher and 16 students, and this teacher was kind enough to send me a lovely, bound booklet with some of the -- with the letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">And she said she had high expectation for the class and student, and she worried, but eventually the class -- she was afraid that the class become desensitized by the narratives of horror. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">But eventually she saw the transformation of students to deeper understanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And she said, “This is the moment that all teachers dream of, and I knew that the class had been successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">It was your visit and your important message that coincided with this success. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">The student had already begun to bring the Holocaust, the human capacity for genocide, and the responsibility of the bystander into discussion about current social injustices around the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">They had started to question their own complicity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">They asked what they could do for <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> , for <span class="COUNTRY">Rwanda</span> , for <span class="REGION">East Timor</span> , for those suffering on our own soil, and it was your talk, your willingness to speak of your losses and to testify for those who are forever silent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">Your dedication to social action that solidified this response from the students. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">It was invaluable for all students, ranging from those who had never studied the Holocaust to your own granddaughter, to hear a survivor bear witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">All of the students posted lengthy notes about your visit on our email news -- newsgroup.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">And I will read a couple of excerpts.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1234">QUESTION:  Yeah ga -- about five or so, because they are really important, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1235">ANSWER:  Yes, by the way, they -- they endeared themselves to me because they all called me Nana, as my granddaughter does, who is part of this class. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1236">Dear Nana, some people come into our lives and quickly live -- leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">Some stay for awhile, leave footprints on our hearts, and we are never, ever the same.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">This is how she started her response. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">Maggie Gandi wrote, “Mrs. Rothschild made clear not only her appreciation for the fact that we are studying the Holocaust, but also channe -- challenged us to spread what we have learned to future generations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">Therefore, I’m going to take from this class, more than the images provoked by any one passage or movie clip, are the words of Mrs. Rothschild. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">The challenge that we not forget what we have learned, and that we bear some of her burden by passing our knowledge onto our children and peers, so the stories of the Holocaust are never forgotten.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">Another student wrote, “I had such a great time talking to her, not only about her Holocaust experiences, but about life in general. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">I think that it took so much courage and fortitude for her to speak for over 30 years about -- 20 years, about her horrific experience during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">I just want to finish by saying that I admire Alexis’s grandmother so much for not only coming to talk to us, but for just volunteering to talk to anyone who is willing to listen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">I also admire her because she has such an air of dignity and pride that surrounds her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">I am definitely a better person for having met her.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">There’s so many. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1248">indecipherable] Let’s see now, I can’t find -- “In our final meeting the students presented me with a gift. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">They gave me a picture from -- frame engraved with the words, we will remember, April 14, 1999. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">Inside was a photo of you and I with the entire class, taken on the day of -- of your visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">For me this gift is a lasting monument, a commitment that the members of col -- Holocaust testimonies will remain vigilant, strive for social justice, and educate future generations about the Holocaust.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">This 1s what -- she had it -- her letter with, but I wanted Melina.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1253">QUESTION:  Take your time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">Just look for the ones that you really want to -- to read.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1255">ANSWER:  This letter Pll -- Il read an excerpt from, 1s from a girl from a -- <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">Dear Nana, I’m writing this letter to thank you for coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duke</span> on Wednesday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">I -- although I was unable to attend your formal talk, I enjoyed hearing your stories from an intimate perspective. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">They’re extremely vivid accounts of your experiences in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , and encouraged me to think more about the situation in regards to my relatives in <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">I am sure that those who have heard you speak will agree that you have made a tremendous impact on their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">I will never forget being moved to tears by your words and emotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">I find it extremely fortunate that I was able to hear your experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">Again, I thank you so much for coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">Until then, to your health and happiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">Melina.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">And this is from my granddaughter. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1266">Dear Nana, thank you for doing something for me that forever will be part of my memories at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duke</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">Your speech was wonderful and inspirational as us -- always. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">The presence that you have while speaking to o -- strangers, bearing your soul and revealing some of your most painful experiences, astounds me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">As I have said before, your family can rest in peace knowing that you told and continue to tell their story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">You are -- you have touched many lives with your testimony, but you have touched me because of the person you ca -- became -- become after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">Your generosity, love and strength are your greatest assets and you have taught me well, as I now enter my senior year of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duke</span> and begin to look for the <span class="DLF">road</span> I will travel next, I will keep all that you have told me in my heart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">Thank you again for coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duke</span> and for sharing yourself so unselfishly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">I love you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">Always, Alexis.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1275">QUESTION:  How does that make you feel when you read that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1276">ANSWER:  Wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">Wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">Th-There’s so many of them here, it’s -- well, but Joan has it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1279">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">So you -- our listeners who would like to read more of those can find it at the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1281">ANSWER:  Yes, the booklet 1s -- I -- the teacher was thoughtful enough to send me two copies, one for me and one for the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> specifically, and I forwarded it to Dr. ronga -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ringelheim</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1282">QUESTION:  Well, since we are with the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , let me follow up with a question about the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">How do you -- how do you see the role of the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Museum</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">How do you feel about what -- what they are doing, or what they have done already”
ANSWER:  Well, I express myself, I feel very eloquently about it on my video. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">I -- I was absolutely delighted with the creation of this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , because it is a tremendous tool, not only of showing people what has happened, but as a tool for educating people for the future, how to learn to get along. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">How to -- how to see things from the perspective of different human beings, people who went through it, people who did help, people who taught about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">The <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> has testimonies of so many survivors, and they range from people who can hardly express themselves to people who are very articulate and who can just bare their soul, and try to teach the listeners, and open their eyes and ears and teach them the lessons.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1288">QUESTION:  I’ve heard some survivors be quite critical, though, of the fact that this is not a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> solely dedicated to Jewish survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">Ho-How do you feel about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1290">ANSWER:  No, I disagree strongly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">I disagree because then it would defeat the purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">If it would be only to perpetuate the Jewish Holocaust, it would be very parochial. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">I think that the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> is a warning and teaching experience for people of all persuasions all around the world, of all the people who can have the access to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">It is a morally and ethically marvelous tool, because it exposes people to -- not only to the evil, but also to the goodness. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">It exposes people to the teaching of the survivors like myself, what did they learn, and what did they want to tell the future generations? </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">Because we as survivors are getting old, and we are dying out, and we will be the last ones who will be heard from.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1297">QUESTION:  Do you think there can ever be too much education about the Holocaust? </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">Because some people are also a little fearful that too much quote, fixation on the Holocaust takes away from more -- fr-from other aspects of Jewish culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1299">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">I disagree. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">This is my point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">You can never take away from the culture by teaching people how to get along with other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">It is this -- my individual understanding, and I hope by -- that people who will listen to me will agree with me, that the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , it was created for the purpose of teaching people to avoid in the future, genocides not only of Jewish people, but all the people everywhere on this earth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">Unfortunately, we have the bad examples occurring now throughout the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">And this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> teaches people how to -- how to understand this, and how to avoid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">How can the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> be a -- a -- 0-only preaching about the Jewish genocide? </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">There’s genocide now going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1308">QUESTION:  D-Do you feel that there was a certain point in American history when people were beginning to be more interested and more knowledgeable about the Holocaust in -- in -- as -- aS a Whole? </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">Was -- do you think there was a certain turning point, or -- yeah, well, that’s the first point of my question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1310">ANSWER:  I think that many of the survivors who became successful 1n their private lives were very instrumental in pushing the idea of creating this <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and they were able to support it financially. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And ever since that time -- there are other <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> in different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> that are being spurred by the idea of the -- of the <span class="BUILDING">Washington Holocaust Museum</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1312">QUESTION:  And how do you feel about sort of popular films and -- and sort of popular culture to -- representing the Holocaust?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1313">ANSWER:  Well, I’m not too fond of them because they could never really portray the true Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">The movie “Holocaust” that was in three or four parts, was a -- a -- a fairy tale, absolutely pointless. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">On the other hand, “Schindler’s List” was a teaching tool. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">I feel that Schindler deserved to be mentioned because no matter what his motives in the beginning were -- he was a businessman who wanted to cash in on, and make money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">However, eventually, by seeing the injustice and the h-horror of the German authorities, he changed his mind and he became instrumental in saving people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">So this fi-film I believe it -- 1t was worthwhile.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1319">QUESTION:  Do you -- are you a part of a s-survivor group, or do you -- do you socialize with survivors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1320">ANSWER:  Not really, because where I lived, I -- I have my few friends here who happen to be just American born friends, and not necessarily Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">I -- we have a writing class, we have a reading club, and I also play Bridge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">I do not belong to the group which is very active in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , of -- there is no -- no reason really, I just can’t travel them and I -- I stay in touch with people who help me because I can’t drive, they pick me up and take me with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1323">QUESTION:  Is there anything that you would like to say to end this interview? </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">I have asked you what I wanted you to ask -- what I wanted to ask you and --
ANSWER:  As usual, my ending would be first thanking the interviewer for taking the time, and being very kind, and asking me all the questions and traveling here in the very hot day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">And my philosophy is always the same, I try to persuade people to open their hearts, and open their ears, and thinking of -- that we are here on this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> , put on temporarily, and we should make the best of the time that is allotted to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">Why do we have to fight? </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">What divides us? </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">We all are of human race, no matter what color, what religious persuasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">We should concentrate on doing the very best to get along and to -- to divert our energy and resources to help eradicate the [indecipherable] that we have spread around the world.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1333">ANSWER:  Well -- well, my life as I would have thought when I was young and hope for the future, it’s very different from the one I pictured for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">For one thing I thought that I will go on with my education to -- to the -- to the nth degree because <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was always my -- my favorite. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">And my health problems prevented me from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">However, I taught myself English well enough to be able to speak about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">And I -- and I educated my daughter in the manner that I wanted to be educated myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">And the next generation, my granddaughter as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">So these 50 years, I am proud of what I did in my small measure, to -- to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">And I can see that the help is in the form of the letters that I receive from people who listen to me, and in the next generation, my daughter and my granddaughter, who are perpetuating my dream of good life and education and -- and being close to the family.</span></p>
