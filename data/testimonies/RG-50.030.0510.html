<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  Who was in your immediate family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  My immediate family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  No, in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , when you were a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  When I was a child, I had one brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">My brother’s name was Vanna, Vanna Cohn, and he was born in 1923, and I was born in 1928, so my parents just had two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My father’s name was Ernst Cohn, my mother’s name -- maiden name was Margaret -- Marguerita Marcuza, later on Marguerita Cohn. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And my grandfather’s name, who was also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , was Hugo Cohn. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">He was married to Zelma Lusch.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about the personalities of your parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  My father had a <span class="BUILDING">linen factory</span> , and we had a very good sized <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in the same <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">The <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was downstairs and had many employees. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">The articles that were sold were mostly very elegant linens. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">In fact, when my parents sent me to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> as a little girl, my suitcase has many linens from my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I’m still using them today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  And what about his personality? </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Can you describe him to me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">ANSWER:  My father was a very jovial person. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">He was a happy person. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I remember many parties at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my parents were good dancers. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And the parties which my parents gave is something that always remained with me, because it was a very comfortable, lovely <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in my early childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">QUESTION:  And your mother, your mother’s personality?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  I think I’m a lot like my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">My mother was born Marguerita Marcuza in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stargard</span> , and the <span class="REGION">area</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pommern</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stargard</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pommern</span> is now Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">My mother was a very hospitable person, and as I remember, there were many cultured type of affairs such as music at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">There was always piano playing and entertaining, and these were the early memories that I have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  What about memories of your family at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="33">What are some of the earliest memories you have of your family all together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  Well, the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> played an important part. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Every Friday night the men would go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I think my mother was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on Friday night, and then there was the usual Shabbas dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And I do have a picture of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room table</span> on a regular Shabbat evening, with the candles, and the challah, the kiddish cup, and my grandfather, who lived upstairs, would always be at our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> every Friday evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">This would be routine, and then on a Shabbat morning, we always went to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">The <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> played a big role in my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">The men and women were seated separately. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">The men were downstairs and the women were upstairs like in a <span class="BUILDING">gallery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">The children were with the women and we would look through this little <span class="DLF">fence</span> -type thing and go downs -- look downstairs at the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And I would look forward to the one particular time that the children were allowed downstairs in the main <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and that was Simchas Torah, when they had s-sweets and candies for the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And I even remember playing a prank here or there in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> by putting some bread -- breadcrumbs or cookies into some men’s jackets. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My friend Ruth Oppenheimer, her name then was Ruth Lindheimer, but she also lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and we are still very, very good friends, I talk to her daily, well she and I played this prank and we put these cookies, or crumbs into men’s suits and pockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And eventually we had to go and own up to it and apologize. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">We did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Do you remember the name of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  I only remember my [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I don’t know if it had a particular name. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">There was one- this was the main <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and then there was another little <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Klaus</span> , and that was for those who were super, super Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And there were quite a few Jewish family who were very, very Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which used to be the <span class="BUILDING">Klaus synagogue</span> is where they are now having the new little <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> to commemorate and try to show what Jewish life was like before Hitler.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  And what about your family, would you consider your family Orthodox? </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Your family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  No, my family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> was not considered very Orthodox, although we had separate dishes for milk and meat, and by American standards, I would con -- probably say it would have been Orthodox. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">But by the standards of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , it was not considered to be so, because people were either extremely Orthodox -- and I remember my mother saying [indecipherable] kosher, which means we are new kosher, and that meant we’re not so terribly strict.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  So, can you describe to me a little more about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  It was a very charming <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of mostly half-timbered <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Half-timbered means it’s sort of cement and wood together, with a great deal of detail of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And I remember some of the old <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , one having a statue on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and that is the <span class="BUILDING">town hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">This statue was called Bucco, and we learned a little poem as children, which says Bucco von Halberstadt [speaks German here]. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And it means, Bucco from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , what will you give our children? </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Will you give them a new pair of shoes? </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Yes, that’s what your children should have. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And I remember some of these children’s songs and some of these children’s poems, because I was 10 and a half years old when I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  And how large of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , would you say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">ANSWER:  I really don’t know, but there were hundreds of families, but I do not know the exact number. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I am sure that that could be found at the mew -- new <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , which is now called the <span class="BUILDING">Moses Mendelssohn Academy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">They would have all the exact figures and details.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  What was your sense of things, was it a -- a fairly large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> for the size of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  Yes, I believe it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">As a matter of fact, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> was well renowned in the Jewish circles, because of having a large community and a very active <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and a very active Jewish community life. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I have noticed that in some of those old papers that I have, and the ones that date back about 300 years, they were written in Hebrew, so we had some of those translated. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And they -- it said for instance, that many businesses were conducted while in s -- during or after <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> when people -- it was a meeting place, so it was a very active Jewish community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  And what about your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Do you remember if it was mostly Jewish friends that your family had, or also non-Jewish friends in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  I do think that my -- the majority of my parent’s friends were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Also, the children I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with, since I was at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , they were all Jewish, and the parents would be fren -- friendly for many, many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">QUESTION:  And can you describe to me a little more in terms of a physical description, your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  Our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was a rather elegant <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">It was situated right above these <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , which were at ground level. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">My grandfather owned the property, and there were at least three to four <span class="INT_SPACE">bedrooms</span> , a large <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , then there was -- the living was qua -- w-was -- the efs -- there was [speaks German], which is a <span class="INT_SPACE">smoking room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So it’s a <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">smoking room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">My <span class="INT_SPACE">parent’s bedroom</span> , my brother’s <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , and mine, and there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">guest bedroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And everything was rather elegantly furnished. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We had a maid who took care of my brother and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Her name was Alvina, and she was with us for many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I have a picture even now of Alvina and my brother and I being at the wedding and I was the flower girl, age about four or five years old, with little flowers in the hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">But I do have the picture of Alvina. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">She married a man who was a carpenter, and my parents asked this ge -- this gentleman to make a copy of our <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , so I had a small <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , a replica of my parent’s <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and as a child I played with that a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> my par -- parents actually sent that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">children’s furniture</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">What happened to it, I don’t know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  What are your earliest memories as a child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  They were happy memories and I remember the first day of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , where my friend Ruth Lindheimer [indecipherable] and I started <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And children at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> get like a big bag, like a huge cone out of cardboard, and that is filled with candy and toys and pencils. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So that was a very happy kind of memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">That was approximately 1935, and I was at the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> until the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was closed, and that was after Kristallnacht - Crystal Night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">QUESTION:  So one of your first memories is -- is probably the first day of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and -- and tell me more about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , other memories you have of the early days of being in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  I guess things were still quite normal in the early days. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">For instance, Hebrew was taught from the beginning on, like a foreign language. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Later on I would learn a foreign language by translation. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And so we translated prayers, and not only learned to translate word for word, but also how to make little sentences, so that we had a fairly good knowledge of Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I can still read Hebrew, although I must say that when I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I had little contact later on with Jewish people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  So you were at a <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Yes, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was religious and the headmaster’s name was Luntner, Herr Luntner. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">That family had five children in various ages from -- some -- the older one was called yo -- Jota, and she came with me to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> on the day I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was a happy time, and it seemed perfectly normal, we did the usual things, like gymnastics. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I would walk to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , it was not very far, probably a 10 minute walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And having been back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> a couple of years ago, I saw the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  Do you know the name of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Yeah, this was the Juda [indecipherable] in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">The <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="114">How many chil -- students were there, I don’t know, but I do have a picture of all the students together, taken in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> at a ttme when my brother and I were at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together, and my friend Ruth, and her present husband Henry are also on that picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">There are approximately 40 students on that photo which I have.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  Now tell me a little more about your brother, his personality and when you were very young, did the two of you get along, did you fight? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Tell me about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Well, my brother was, as I said, five years older than I, and he seemed to be very proud of having a little sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">He often told me later on as we were growing up that he said [speaks German here]. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">In other words that means I or -- put in an order for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So he was very proud of having a little sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Although, as I grew up, I think I was sometimes a bit of a burden when my parents said they had to take me along, and I would drag behind all these boys, who were teenagers by then, and they had to take along the younger sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">So it wasn’t always great fun for him, but perfectly normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">However, my brother took great responsibility for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Obviously, my parents must have said that he should keep an eye on me always, and he always did because the two of us were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , even though we were not together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  And what about, since you were at a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , I’m imagining the other students are Jewish, did you have any non-Jewish friends in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  I can’t remember any discrimination, but I actually don’t think that among my circle of friends that there were non-Jewish friends, because they were probably children I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with, and children whose parents my parents knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">So I don’t have any real collection -- recollection of anyone non-Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Now, when the Nazis came to power, you were very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And tell me what your very earliest memories are about the beginning of the Nazis and the Hitler regime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  You know, times were not like they are today where you put on a television and you see instantly what is happening in some other part of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">And I think my parents shielded us from any extra worries, or extra concerns. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">However, I do remember seeing signs in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> that said, Juden [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">That means, Jews are not welcome here. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And I would question that sort of thing by -- because I could read by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">In 1933, Hitler came to power on my birthday, January 30". </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Other <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> had a holiday because Hitler was in power, it was a day off from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Not in the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> , we went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And then one day, coming from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> -- and this would be closer to like 1938, other kids would call across the <span class="DLF">street</span> , look at those Jews, look at those Jewish children, and the kids would throw stones at us. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And I said -- I could not understand, why would they be throwing stones at us, we weren’t doing anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And you’d run <span class="BUILDING">home</span> as quick as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So these are my first bad feelings on knowing that something was going on beyond our control.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  Well, you would run <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and you would probably talk to your parents about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">What were they telling you? </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Do you remember any of the discussions with your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  I was aware that there was a Nazi party, because the other children, who were not Jewish, belonged to an organization called the Hitlerjugend. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The Hitler youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And of course, my brother did not belong to the Hitler youth, who would have been maybe 14 or 15 at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">But the Jewish youngsters had their own organization, the Maccabee or some other clubs that they would have. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">But the Hitler youth were very visible in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and of course I was aware of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">But it was not a major discussion in my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> until the night of Kristallnacht, when the Nazis came to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in the middle of the night, and they knocked at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and if -- everybody was sleeping, it was an ordinary night, no one expected anything unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And there were two men at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and they said, we are here to get mis -- Mr. Cohn, Ernst Cohn, my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And he had to get dressed very quickly, and the two men marched downstr -- the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> 1s diagonally across from the main <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The main <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> is still there, our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> is not. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And as we looked out, we could see other Jewish men, each one with two SS men, they’re -- the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And they walked them off, we did not know where they were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">They took them and put them into a <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And a couple of hours later they knocked at our <span class="DLF">door</span> again, and they said, we came to get the other Mr. Cohn. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And my mother said, you already took him, he’s gone, he -- he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And they said, there’s another one. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Well, my brother was hiding in a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> or somewhere that same night. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And she said, the only other Herr Cohn is upstairs, but you would have to carry him because he is an invalid and he is very old. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They said no, that’s not the one, and they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">That way my brother was not taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">My father was then taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  Can you -- can I ask you, what was this like? </span><span class="sentence" id="168">You were very young, and -- and was this very frightening, that night that this happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Well, I realized that things were terribly, terribly wrong, and it’s a -- an extraordinarily scary event for any child. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I did not know the multitude of significance of what was happening on a worldwide basis at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">My father was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> for a little over five weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We did find out where he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I don’t know whether it was Red Cross letters, or -- by some way, my mother knew where my father was. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after five weeks, a good five weeks in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and his hair was shaven from his head completely, he had lost a lot of weight. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And my father, having been on the <span class="DLF">road</span> as a salesman for many years, said, I always brought you something <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , well I brought you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And he had dry bread in his pockets that was very, very hard, but he said, I brought this for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">It was then, when my father came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , that my parents decided they must do something to rescue the lives of their children, for my brother and I. And they then registered me for the -- or both of us for the kindertransport. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">My brother, however, was 15 at the time, and I was 10, and at 15 they no longer took children on the kindertransport. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">They took them from four to 14, and he was a little too old, so he was not able to have guardians in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> like I did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">QUESTION:  Now, let me ask you, before Kristallnacht, did you notice -- do you remember other things that were happening and changing? </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Did you ask any -- you know, additional questions of your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Do you remember anything else going on even before all of this happened at Kristallnacht?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  Well, they came to every <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> and collect -- demanded all silver and gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So my parents had to give up the jewelry, and I believe they must have hidden certain things, they did not give up everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">But they hi -- picked up sil -- silverware. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">You were allowed to keep two sets of silver per person. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">So I don’t know just how many things my parents were able to save legitimately, but I remember them coming to every <span class="BUILDING">Jewish home</span> and collecting these items. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And of course my father’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">You were no longer allowed to have a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , to run a business, which my -- was in my f -- grandfather’s hands, and then my father’s hands for many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">There was this <span class="DLF">line</span> and fabrique Halberstadt. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But it was closed, and I think my father took a little suitcase, and traveled with this suitcase to some of his customers who were located in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> -- countryside somewhere, and he would continue doing some business, going by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">QUESTION:  What happened to that <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> once it was shut? </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Did anything else happen there, did others take it over?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">ANSWER:  Others took over the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and I don’t remember exactly who owned it at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But at -- the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> always belonged to my grandfather, and bef -- tween the main <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , there was a <span class="DLF">yard</span> in the back of the main <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and then another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , called <span class="BUILDING">Hinterhouse</span> , like the second row of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , and that had tenants in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">So there were a lot of people living in that small <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Unfortunately, just towards the end of World War II, the whole property was bombed, and there’s none of that left, and when I went over there for the first time, I thought I would feel terrible about seeing my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , but it’s no longer there. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">So I did not have to feel terrible about a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> I had never seen before, built by the Russians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  Now let me also ask, what was happening among your <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends? </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Were -- were other children leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> even before Kristallnacht? </span><span class="sentence" id="201">What -- what did you notice about any of your friends during this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  The friends -- circle of friends grew smaller and smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Gradually families emigrated to any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which would offer them asylum. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">My parents had a quota number to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And I know the quota number was 51 thousand and something and it would have taken one to two years before that quota number would come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">Meantime, though, other families emigrated to <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , to any part of the world that would take them. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And it was very hard to find a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that would take in a Jewish family. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">For instance, in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> you needed to have someone who would guarantee that they would take care of you if you did not have employment. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">We had an unc -- my -- brother of my mother, Hans Marcuza was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and he filled out all the necessary papers for our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">But the quota number which we had would not have come due for at least a year or two after the war had started. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So in the meantime, my family, my f -- mother and father decided that 1t would best -- be best to send us to a safe <span class="REGION">area</span> anywhere, and then they filled out the application at <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> to- for the kindertransport.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  Can you explain what <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span> 1s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Bloomsbury House</span> was the organization in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , similar to HIAS in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">A Jewish a- organization that sponsored particularly Jewish children. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And they took an -- not only an interest, but followed each child who was able to come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , they would follow their progress, and you had something to fall back upon, which was <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  I think I’m going to turn the tape over. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">End of Tape One, Side A Beginning of Tape One, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">This is tape number one, side B. Okay, if you want to continue with what you were saying before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">ANSWER:  We were discussing the kindertransport and <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">It was summer vacation time, and it was, of course, after Kristallnacht, so the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">There was no more official <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but it was the height of summer, and my mother and I always went to visit her mother, her parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stargard</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pommern</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So my mother and I were spending a week or two vacation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stargard</span> when my father contacted my mother and said we have to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> right away because Lillyshin -- they called me little Lilly has guardians in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and she’s leaving for <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> next week. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So we packed up, we left Uma in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stargard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Of course, this was the last time I saw her. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And we went via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , and my mother sh -- did a great deal of shopping for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Little [indecipherable] dresses with matching aprons, and we had a seamstress coming into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , that was the normal thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">She made a couple of dresses and clothes for me for the departure, which was the following week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  Can we back up just for a moment? </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I think that you started to keep a diary even before you left. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Do you remember when you started keeping the diary?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">ANSWER:  Yes, I do remember the diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">For my 10" birthday I got a diary from my mother, and on the front page it says tagabu, which 1s diary, given to me by mutti, by my mother, for my birthday. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And I wrote about every day life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , and the little pranks we played as children, and the normal life, really, because I was a pretty happy-go-lucky child, and did not have all the burdens of the world on my shoulder. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">So I kept this diary, and the first part of it is all written in German, however when I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , being on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and feeling very much alone and knowing no one, I wrote into the diary, and I even wrote into the diary in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , which is the route we took from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to -- from Hook van Holland to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And since there was nobody for me to communicate with, and I didn't realize that suddenly I was really alone and on my way somewhere, not knowing where I was going, I guess it became a bit scary, and so I wrote into the diary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">QUESTION:  Even before you got onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> headed, you know, to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , eventually, on the kindertransport, what were your feelings at the time that you heard -- you were on vacation at that time, I believe -- what were your feelings about hearing that you were going to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">ANSWER:  Since that was my parent’s wish, to have us in a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> , my parents were actually very clever, because when I think about how my parents handled discussing this with me, I only realize how very wise they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">For instance, both my parents said, look how lucky you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">You will be learning another language, you will be seeing new people. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And they just made me feel like I was very special and very fortunate, so I believed that and -- and left quite happily, not realizing then that I would never see my parents again. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And of course, I must add that we were all in hopes that we would be reunited in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">If that quota number had come through and had not been a war declared, eventually my parents would have gone to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and we would have joined them. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And that was the fact with many of the other children who came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> like I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">I was not one of the fortunate ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  Now before we get to the day of your departure from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , can you tell me what else you remember having happened at the time of Kristallnacht in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Were there other signs of things that had happened that night?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  Those are all very unhappy memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I know that many Jewish families, whoever were there, it was the women, came to my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , which was always a very gracious, open <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , very ha-happy place for people to congregate. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So people came there just to be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And I know that eventually they all had to give up their <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> and <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and I heard that many families moved in with my parents, and that was after I had left. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">But my memories of the time when my father was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , it was a terrible time and great insecurity. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">We did not know if my father would come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , if he would survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">We were already aware that terrible things were happening to Jews everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">So these were unhappy memories, and my parent’s effort was to save the life’s of their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  What other efforts do you remember them making for the whole family to emigrate? </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Were they still trying to do that, or they thought that that was not possible any more?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">ANSWER:  At that time it was very difficult to get across the <span class="DLF">border</span> anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I believe my father would have had the opportunity to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Cuba</span> , but he did not want to go alone, he would not have left my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">So unless they could have gone together, my father did not want to go alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I was told that, and I think that happened after I was already in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Now, I only know that the family I mentioned before from the headmaster, those children, there were five children, would have had an opportunity to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on the kindertransport, but Herr Luntner said, either we all go, or none of us go. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And that’s the choice that people had. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">So that on the monument which 1s today in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> at the place where all the Jewish people had to assemble to be deported, all the Jewish people, and on the men -- monument are the names of the people who were deported, and it has the father and mother of the Luntners and all five children. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">My parent’s name is also on the same monument, and I know that if my parents had not sent me to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , my name would have been there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  Now, when you were on vacation with your mother, and you learned that you would be going to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> soon, what did you learn at that time about the people you would go and stay with in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  Well that’s an interesting question because my father’s sister, my Aunt Lucy, Tante Lucy Spear was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> she was a very wealthy woman, married to a banker in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , Ulya Spear. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Now she became a chambermaid in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">So my parents wrote to Tante Lucy and said Lillyshin is going to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> next week, this is the address of the family, Mr. and Mrs. Allen, and the address in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochdale</span> , <span class="REGION">Lancashire</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">My aunt immediately contacted the Allens, and visited the Allens, and they were very gracious to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">So we had a little knowledge about the family I would be going to. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">My aunt then wrote to my parents and said that I would be very lucky to be with such a wonderful family and that they are very, very anxious to have me come. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And so we had a little knowledge about the family I would be going to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  And you know, how did the match get made with this family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">ANSWER:  The match was made through <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">People who applied wrote in about the age of the children, and a photograph, and a little about the family and family background. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">The Allens actually had tried for a different child, but -- her name was Erica, and it did not go through for some reason because Erica had other foster parents who would take care of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I met Erica much later when we were at <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I saw -- I had seen the picture of her, and now I met her, so I took the <span class="NPIP">place</span> of that child, Erica, and they chose me by the photograph and background of my family’s history.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  Did your parents have to put up money for this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  I really don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">If so, it probably was very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">I think I read somewhere that they put up some money, but it would not have been very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I think that we were just told what we were allowed to take with us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , which was a rucksack and a small bag that you could handle by yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION:  Did you have other items sent to you, or was that the only -- were those the only items you took from your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER:  After I got to the Allens, my parents send the little <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> I had, out of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">It was about the size of a -- the height of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dining room table</span> , 1t was a good size little unit of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">dishwashing sink</span> and a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">And my friend Ruth had the same thing made. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So they sent that and a very large <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamer trunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steamer trunk</span> was, at the very bottom, an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Oriental rug</span> , a runner, and a lot of linens. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And of course I couldn’t understand why I should have all these linens, but they’re beautiful works of art, all handmade, and of course that was my father’s business. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And I have always kept these linens and I’m using the pillowcases to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They are just very, very beautiful, and they wash beautifully, and it’s a constant reminder of my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">There was also an accordion when these things arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">At customs they s -- thought that the accordion was sent as a valuable item that one could sell as an investment, so they said, can I play it? </span><span class="sentence" id="297">So I said sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So I remember right there in the customs, where someone from the Allen’s family took me, and I took the accordion and played quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So they were -- I was able to keep the accordion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">QUESTION:  Well just going back a little, were you musical as a child in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Did you play music or have other hobbies that you pursued?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">ANSWER:  Yes, I did have piano lessons as a young child in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I had piano lessons in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and played Chopin, Schubert and Mozart and Beethoven.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION:  Any other hobbies or interests you remember as a small -- as a young child in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  Art was always my hobby. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">If I had a choice to go to a <span class="BUILDING">toy shop</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">dress shop</span> or a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for pens and pencils and paint, I would certainly choose whatever had to do with art. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">And that has remained with me throughout my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">But then, my mother was an artist, so maybe I saw her painting and I just took to it, and it’s something that I have enjoyed, and I have enjoyed being creative.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">QUESTION:  Did your mother work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">ANSWER:  I know she would not have a job, but I think she was in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> downstairs for a certain time, but there was someone taking care of us, Alvina was always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So she might have helped in the business, but art was my mother’s hobby, and I just remember her painting a great deal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">QUESTION:  So now let’s talk a little bit about the -- the day -- the days leading up to your departure from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , what you remember about either the preparations, any family discussions you remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="313">ANSWER:  The preparations were pretty frantic because it was only one week and there was the shopping and the packing, and then of course my mother sat down with me and said, you know, there may not be anyone there who will explain the facts of life to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And little did I understand what my mother was talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">She said, you know, you’re a pretty little girl, and don’t sit on a man’s lap and don’t let a man get too close to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And I couldn’t understand what she’s talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">I said sure, sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I didn't realize until I was in my teens did I know what my mother was talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">She also explained menstruation, not to be scared if that should happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And of course at the age of 10 it’s very early to be speaking about these things, especially since I wasn’t asking these questions, but my mother probably anticipated that there may not be anyone there who would explain these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And it wasn’t until much later that I really understood what that was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But my recollections in getting ready were all positive, because I was told how lucky I am and you see this [indecipherable] Ruth I was talk about, she doesn’t have guardians -- she did eventually, and she also came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But at the time, each child who was lucky enough to go was considered very, very fortunate, because -- and by that time everyone was trying frantically to get out, just to be secure and to save lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="324">QUESTION:  And do you remember any discussions with your father as well, or mostly with your mother as you were leaving -- getting ready to leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="325">ANSWER:  The discussions were mostly with my mother, but the letters are more for my father because they were typewritten letters that came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And they were always good humored and good-natured. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">In none of the letters did it ever say, your <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> is empty and we miss you. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">It was always, look how lucky you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And in my first letter to my parents, I wrote that ma -- the guardians wanted me to call them Pop and Ma, and I didn’t want to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">But my father wrote back -- no, it was my mother who wrote, you see how lucky you are, you already have two sets of parents and I had to wait until I was married to have a second set of parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">So you’re very fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Go to them and give them a hug and tell them you love them, and always be gracious and be grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">So my parent were extremely positive about everything and that made me feel, well they know what is right and -- for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="334">QUESTION:  Do you know how it is that they wound up being so positive? </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Do you have any perspective at this point, or insight as to how they were able to do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">ANSWER:  I think it’s -- you just have to have very strong character to be able to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">And now that I am older, and have children of my own, I have often thought that if I were in that same position to send children away, I’m quite su -- I am not sure that I would have done that, because I think it is a terrible thing for parents to part with their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">As I said, there were some who said we will all go or none of us go, and it’s a dreadful decision for parents to have to make. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And I am not sure that I would have done what my parents did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="340">QUESTION:  So what do you remember about the actual day that you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  I played the piano in the morning, and I played a German song that I know, it’s -- what was it? [</span><span class="sentence" id="342">speaks German here]. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">Because I played the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> quite well, that means, do I have to go, do I have to go out of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">That’s the name of that song. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And I just thought it was very fitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And I took my diary with me, and a sandwich, which was in the rucksack. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">And my parents and my brother and Yuta, somebody we knew from very good friends, came to the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">And Yuta took the picture of my departure at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">So the whole family, my brother, my parents and I are on this picture at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And today you can see the same <span class="DLF">water tower</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">It was not bombed, and it’s still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">When I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> a few years ago, I went back to the same <span class="NPIP">spot</span> and had a picture taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  So this was in the morning you went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  Yes, we went to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="355"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> was the next bigger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> my parents were no longer allowed to go onto the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , to the <span class="DLF">track</span> to say goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">They kept parents away at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">That’s why I think the picture of my parents and I at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is a rather rare picture, and it is used a great deal for teaching purposes in <span class="BUILDING">American schools</span> and <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="359">So that particular picture was taken in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , but not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">There was one other boy who went with me on the kindertransport, his name was David Winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">He was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> with me, and eventually went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="362">QUESTION:  So your parents were able to travel with you from that <span class="DLF">train platform</span> where the photo was taken, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> , and then that’s where they had to say the final goodbye. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And tell me how -- how was the final goodbye at the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  Well, In -- I think my mother was sort of hiding under a big collar of coat, and it’s just a very heart wrenching time in everybody’s lives, and suddenly fi -- I found myself sitting on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> -- in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with other youngsters, nobody knew each other, and it was a very, very strange feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I guess I looked out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> and at that point there was no one there, and I -- it was the first time I realized that I’m really alone, and where am I off to? </span><span class="sentence" id="366">However, the kindertransport was well organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">It was a locked <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , Nazis came in, they would ask questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Do you have rings, do you have a diamond, do you have a watch? </span><span class="sentence" id="369">They would ask all kinds of questions, but for security reasons I think everyone was very careful with their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Parents would not put their children at risk, so -- but they would be walking around, and finally we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and suddenly the older children were very jubilant and so happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">They said that we have left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">This is the -- this is an upsetting time, having left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">However, people got onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> once we got to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and they brought cocoa and cookies and apples, and the older children, who were more aware of what was going on, were very jubilant and they sang Hebrew songs, the sort of songs they would sing at a <span class="BUILDING">club</span> or at a party. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And it was only then that I realized that we are really out of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">From <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> we got onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , which took us across the <span class="DLF">English channel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And we were assigned certain berths. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">My <span class="INT_SPACE">berth</span> was the <span class="INT_SPACE">upper berth</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And I had never slept in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> that was made with sheets and blankets, because in my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">feather bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Was like a huge <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pillow</span> , and you got under the -- under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">feather bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Well, I didn’t know what to do with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">I slept on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , I did not know that you had to get in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">And I thought it was a rather strange way of living, but -- so I did all the things that were expected and required, and by morning we arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">I believe it was Harrage. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And we were all herded off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and were taken to a huge, huge <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> , with lots of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">And we all had a tag around our neck with a number, like a cardboard tag with a ribbon. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">And you -- each per -- kid had a different number, and then you waited until somebody called your number. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I guess they did it in English and German at the time, just the numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">And when my number came up, this -- to me she seemed like an elderly lady, she was probably in her 40’s, and that was Nellie, Nellie Mills, the private secretary of Mr. Allen. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">He sent his private secretary to pick me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And Nellie Mills was always very, very kind to me and very good-hearted. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I had great respect for her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="392">QUESTION:  So what was the first meeting like that day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">ANSWER:  Well, Nellie told me later on that of course she couldn’t speak to me in German and I -- cause I was babbling away in German, and whatever she said I couldn't understand, but by my actions - she knew that I was wiggling around, and that I needed a <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">So the first thing she do -- did, was to take me to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , and eventually we ended on another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> which took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> , took us north, and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> we went by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochdale</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochdale</span> is where my guardians lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So Nellie was the one who took me to my guardians. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And was a very, very lovely <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and Mr. and Mrs. Allen were very anxious to have a little girl there. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">It was only later on that I found out their reason why they wanted to have a child in their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">It was a very gracious, beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">They had several <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , a Rolls Royce, and a Lady Austin, a private chauffeur, and Mr. Allen owned a <span class="BUILDING">bus company</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="401">In <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> we would call such a company like Greyhound. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">It was privately owned, called Yelloway. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">So he was the owner of this particular bus company that rode <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Liverpool</span> , long distance <span class="DLF">bus lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="404">They were quite wealthy people. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And the Allens have a son called Hubert. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Hubert was already grown and he was in his 20’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">So he was about 25 years old when I came to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">So, you know, he couldn’t really be bothered with a youngster too much, but he was always very kind to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">We had a very nice relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">They told me that’s my big brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  Do you remember -- do you remember the address where -- where their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was located?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  Yes, I do know, it was on <span class="DLF">Bent Meadows</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochdale</span> , and this <span class="REGION">county</span> is called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lancashire</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lancashire</span> is known for linens, but ha -- the <span class="BUILDING">bus company</span> was one of the big businesses in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochdale</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Mr. Allen owned the company until after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">It was his son who ran the <span class="BUILDING">Yelloway bus company</span> later on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">QUESTION:  And also, just to go back, do you remember the address where you lived as a child in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  Yes, it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , Lilly Cohn, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vestendorf</span> [speaks German here]. </span><span class="sentence" id="418"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vestendorf</span> is the name of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , it’s still called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vestendorf</span> , 34A and B. They were two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that were attached, two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in the front and two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">Yes, I do remember the address and I still remember the telephone number in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="420">speaks German] 26-38. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But one learns it, you know, in German, and that’s why I said it that way, that’s the way I remember it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">QUESTION:  So your first impressions, arriving to this new <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , what do you remember’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="423">ANSWER:  Well, I was shown to my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and I cried a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I know I cried a great deal, because I think it was only then that it hit me that no one could understand me. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">Of course, they knew why I was crying, because I was homesick and it was, I’m sure, quite normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">The Allens did have my aunt come to visit, because my aunt who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> , who had a job there as a maid, sh-she came to visit and of course that was very exciting for me to have someone to talk to. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">But very soon the Allens sent me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">And they were very smart, because they chose the <span class="BUILDING">convent high school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochdale</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">The <span class="BUILDING">convent high school</span> was run by nuns, and these nuns were from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , so they all spoke German. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">It was a German order. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And since no one could speak to me at the <span class="BUILDING">Allen’s house</span> , as soon as I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they could speak to me, and they were very, very kind to me, the nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And I wrote to my parents, of course, and by pa -- End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a United States Holocaust Memorial in -- Museum interview with Lillyan Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">This is tape number two, side A. So you were beginning to tell me about the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> you attended, and your parents corresponding with the nuns, I believe, at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  My parents wrote to the nuns in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochdale</span> , and said to them that they should please not try to change my religion because my religion would be very important to me, and my parents begged them to honor my background. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Of course, it was a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> , and every morning -- they would have prayers in the morning and when children knelt to say certain prayers, and I know all of them, because after all, I memorized them in the name of the Father, and all these prayers that I know, but I would not kneel, I would sit. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And no one would ever say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And eventually they actually let me have some lessons with the Father, who was assigned to the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , and the Father knew Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">So I had the [indecipherable] with me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , and the Father and I would sit in this big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with the stained glass windows, just he and I, and he would continue tran -- letting me translate what I was learning in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">But that just lasted a little while.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">QUESTION:  Do you think religion was important for you at this stage, this transition as a -- as a youngster? </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Did it help you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="443">ANSWER:  Religion was already very deeply imbedded in my life, so that I knew I was different. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">The Allens were not religious people, they just kept the big holidays like Christmas, there’d be big parties and certain times. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">But they were not people who would to go a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and I never went to another <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I don’t think there was one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochdale</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But the nuns were very kind to me in many ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">For instance, when Mrs. Allen was -- Mrs. Allen was rather sickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">She had mental problems of depression, and sh -- at times she could not put up with a child around. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I might be doing something perfectly normal, what I would consider normal, playing with a ball or something, and that could upset her terribly, which I couldn't understand until many years later, when they explained to me that she was having mental problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And that was one of the reasons why they thought that having a child in their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> would be good therapy for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">But it isn’t such good therapy for a child, because I couldn’t understand these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">So I would either live with Nellie for awhile, or I would live with the nuns. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And with the nuns I would frequently have religious debates at a very young age, because I knew a lot from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , being that it was a rather religious community, I was pretty well versed in the Bible, and the -- what I have learned from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So you could not change me, I was pretty -- pretty strong-willed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="456">QUESTION:  What kind of debate would you have? </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Do you remember any of the specifics?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">ANSWER:  No, I -- I don’t know the specifics, but I know that I would stand my point, I would say no, no, no, it couldn’t be that way because God did it this way, or God spoke to Moses or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">I was pretty strong about the things that I had learned. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And I never did have to participate in the New Testament, only in the prayers that they had every morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And as far as the English language is concerned, I learned English very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I would think that within four weeks, I was able to understand the Allens, although I thought they spoke too quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">But within two months I was able to do all the schoolwork, like all the others, and I was on an even level as far as math and other subjects were concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">I had no difficulty in catching up with the English children. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">I wore the uniform of the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , a navy blue uniform with a white collar, and a blue and red hat, and blue and red scarf, and I was dressed like all the other children in the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> and made friends there, and that seemed to be a normal life, which I became accustomed to quite quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  Were you the only Jewish child in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  As far as I know, the only Jewish child, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I never met anyone Jewish while at the Allens. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And I had very little contact with my family, because eventually my brother came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , but by that time the Allens really wanted to keep me away from the family, because they wanted me to feel that I was their little girl.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="470">QUESTION:  Well, let’s go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">First of all, what’s the date when you arrived to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">ANSWER:  In July, 1939.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  And when did you brother come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  Approximately four or five weeks later, I got a letter from my parents saying, guess what, you are very, very lucky, your big brother is going to come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And my brother did not get out until just before the war started, and he got onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , but he was able to make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And he was not nearly as lucky as I was, because at the age of 15, he found himself alone, where I had someone to take care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">He knew some English and was able to get around, and my aunt was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> , but he had a difficult time to just survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">But he got a job, and then another job, and he did very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="479">QUESTION:  So you occasionally saw him, but not very much, it sounds like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  The Allens did not encourage me to have any contact with my aunt or my brother, and by then the war had started. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And when the war started, there were no more letters from my parents, though -- the contact between <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , there were no mail -- there was not the usual mail service, was completely stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Eventually my parents would write to someone in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> who they knew, who readdressed the letters to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So they would go from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">We still had letters from my parents for a year or two.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">QUESTION:  What were they writing about, do you remember’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">ANSWER:  Every letter was a very unhappy letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">It was always, can you do something to help us get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">This and this person has left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we can’t get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">The old people were taken to a <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> , so I think my grandfather was no longer living upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And it must have been a very desperate time. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And of course they would write, why haven’t you written, and can you send us a picture? </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And this is, you know, several years like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Eventually there were Red Cross letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">A Red Cross letter was 25 words. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">25 words from my parents, and they came like a telegram, and you were allowed to write back 25 words, and it goes back to the sender. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">So that was the only communication during the war that was official communication.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">QUESTION:  Now, can you give me a better description, a sense of the Allens? </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Could you tell me each of their first names, and -- and their personalities, even physical description.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="500">QUESTION:  Tell me more about them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="501">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Well, when I first ca-came to the <span class="BUILDING">Allen’s house</span> , Mr. Allen was sick at the time, so he was bedridden with something, no-not on a permanent basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">But he was a very patient and kind man, so I spent a lot of time at his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bedside</span> , and he would teach me English. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">He would point to the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> and say <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> , I would say <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">He would pa -- point to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and say <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , I'd say <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And I repeated everything that he said and then he would point again and see if I would remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And I did fairly well. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Then he went t -- he asked me to bring his wallet, I brought his wallet. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And he took out all kinds of change. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And he said, this is a penny, that’s a threepenny bit, that’s a sixpence, that’s a shilling. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And so I said, a penny, a threepence -- I couldn’t say threepence, that was very hard, because to put your tongue between your teeth to do a t-h, doesn’t exist in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So I probably said tripence, but it’s threepence, three pennies. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And sixpence, a <span class="BUILDING">shilling</span> and I think that’s as high as it went. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">When I had it all correct, he said I could keep it, it’s mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">That I understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">So I thought I was very rich, I now had all this change, which of course I wrote to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">I wrote, I have a penny, a threepence, sixpence, and a <span class="BUILDING">shilling</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And my father, which I have in the first letter said, now that you are so rich, shall I send you the safe which we used to have? </span><span class="sentence" id="519">You see, we no longer had the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">He said, because you need to put all that money in a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="521">So my father’s good humor always came through. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">But Mr. Allen was very, very kind and very patient, but he was a true businessman, very, very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Hubert, the son, who was in his early 20’s, was one who played cricket. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">He had this cricket outfit, and at Christmastime would sing in the Christmas carols, there were all these young men, they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">They were all a lot older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">But he was very, very nice and very kind to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">He was already active in the business at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yelloway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And Mrs. Allen was the typical English housewife. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">When I look back on the times with Mrs. Allen, she was very spoiled, because she had everything done for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">She had maid service all the time, she had a chauffeur just to take her around. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And she lived -- could live very graciously, but she had phobias. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">She thought people were laughing at her. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">I could not understand these things, because a youngster does not understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">But she was a very kind person, and as I said, they told me to call them Pop and Ma, which I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And Hubert, who was the big brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And I was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">It became a new <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">By now the war was on one year, two years, and a ve -- at one time, after Mrs. Allen had been sick again and hospitalized, she got a shock me -- treatments, several times while I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So they told me that they would send me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And I couldn’t understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">They said, well we did not know that the war would go on so long, and we will always take care of you, and they gave me all these stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">But I was extremely upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I think it was much more upset -- maybe more upsetting for me to leave the Allens, because it was a second, complete upheaval. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">The first one I was well prepared for. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">The -- leaving the Allens I was not prepared for, and I didn’t have that security behind me as having parents, real parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So they sent me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> , which is in the south of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="547"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> in the state of Kent. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">And that was a -- don’t remember the exact year, but probably 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">There was still a letter from my parents saying that I should not leave the Allens, please stay with the Allens, but this was beyond my control.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="550">QUESTION:  Did you talk to the Allens? </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Did you tell them that you were unhappy? </span><span class="sentence" id="552">Do you remember conversations at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  You know, this was like a fait accompli, they n -- this was it, I could not argue with anyone about anything, because they made the decisions. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">They told me how much they loved me, and I have all kinds of letters from them, how much I meant to them, and they wanted to have a child of their own, but I would have to be of their religion and they fou -- noticed that they could never change my religion, I was probably too old and too strong for that already. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">And eventually I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="556">QUESTION:  What was their religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="557">ANSWER:  Protestant. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Church of England.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="559">QUESTION:  And can you tell me what -- what are both of their first names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="560">ANSWER:  Margaret was Mrs. Allen, Margaret Allen, and Herbert Allen was Mr. Allen, and Hubert, the son. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Now, the son eventually got married, and I -- and has a d -- one daughter, and I am still in touch with the whole family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="562">QUESTION:  So you were probably with the Allens for at least a couple years, or what do you recall?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="563">ANSWER:  Two to three -- two to three years, I don’t know the date exactly, although in my diary it might record what date I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="564"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> had a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I presume they made the arrangements through <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span> , because all the children who were refugee children were sponsored through <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="565">QUESTION:  So what age are you at about this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">ANSWER:  By then I was 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">12 to 13, maybe 13 when I got to <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="568">The <span class="BUILDING">Beacon</span> was the name of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> , and The <span class="BUILDING">Beacon</span> has been a very big part of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Of course, I didn’t realize that at the time, I was unhappy getting there, but then I suppose every other child who was there probably felt the same way about leaving their guardians. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">Cause every child who was at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> had a guardian somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">And suddenly here we were, we found ourselves all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">There must have been maybe 50 children or more, of different ages, who had all come to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on the kindertransport. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">But now the war was in progress for a couple of years, and the guardians did not realize that they would have these children for so long, and sent them to this particular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , called <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="574">They -- the children there were in age from approximately six to 16. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">When I first got there I was a junior. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Later on we -- we became middles and then we became seniors, depending upon your age group. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And we shared one large <span class="INT_SPACE">dormitory room</span> together for at least 12 or more girls in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And we got to know each other very, very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">The same girls who were at The <span class="BUILDING">Beacon</span> then are still my closest friends today. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">Some of the girls stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> when the war was over, and others went to different parts of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">A few were fortunate enough to be reunited with their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">Some knew that their parents were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">I was among those who were hoping that the parents were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">But, to no avail.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">QUESTION:  Do you think you stayed pretty optimistic throughout this time period of your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">ANSWER:  Yes, I believe so. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I think I have always had an optimistic nature, that’s probably inherited. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">But I don’t think I ever thought about not seeing my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I just presumed that when the war was over, I’d find them somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">We did not know that they were transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , not until several years after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  So tell me about the physical surroundings. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">What -- what was the -- set the scene a little bit at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">ANSWER:  Well, The <span class="BUILDING">Beacon</span> was an old <span class="BUILDING">mansion</span> many, many years ago, and when I think about it from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I think of it as a huge, huge <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="594">When I went back there for a reunion after 50 years, it’s not as big as I thought it was, it’s just an average big <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">But it was a gracious <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and there was lots of laughter and lots of -- of good fun among the girls, although we lived under pretty meager conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">This was, after all, wartime. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Food was rationed, and we had a cook at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> , her name was Mrs. Hayward. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">That name Hayward was important in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Mrs. Hayward was the cook, and we had certain assignments to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">To either peel potatoes or help with the dishwashing. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">After all, there were many, many children there. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">The food was mainly boiled fish, boiled cabbage and boiled potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So you weren't really hungry, because you could eat more potatoes, and you could eat more potatoes, but it was pretty awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">I mean, it was very healthy food because everything was boiled. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">They did not have fats. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">You did not have oil, you didn’t have butter. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">These things were highly rationed during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And we did not see fruit, but vegetables were growing in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , and there were beautiful, beautiful <span class="DLF">grounds</span> attached to The Beacon, with three what we called <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lakes</span> , but they were really puddles. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">What we thought was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> , we took an old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bedstead</span> and thought that was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="610">We paddled around in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">We improvised with everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Occasionally clothes came from <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">There would be a bunch of shoes, and you could try them on, and if a pair fitted you, they were yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">So we had a lot of clothes like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Schooling was at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> , it was not too great. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Later on they sent us to a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and it was called <span class="BUILDING">Holy Trinity</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="617">It was worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">It was really not a good <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I was able to take an exam for a special <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> we have <span class="BUILDING">Stuyvesant High School</span> , Bronx Science, a special <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">The <span class="BUILDING">school</span> would have been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge</span> , we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="622"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge</span> was maybe 10 miles away. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">I passed the test, but then they -- the government said I was not a British subject is what they called it, so I was not able to go to the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , but continued at <span class="BUILDING">Holy Trinity</span> , which was not much of a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="624">But I read a lot and eventually, at the age of 16, I was still there, we all had to choose a career of some sort. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Most of the girls went in for nursing. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And I said no, I didn’t want to be a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And how about a <span class="BUILDING">secretarial school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="628">I said no, I didn’t think I would like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">They said, well what would I like to study? </span><span class="sentence" id="630">So I said art. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">So I di -- took some kind of art exam, probably drawing something very basic, and I was able to go to the <span class="BUILDING">art school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So I went to the school of arts and crafts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> , and loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">We drew from the skeleton, and Michelangelo, and nude figures. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And I think I did quite well, but one of the ladies from the committee who took care of The Beacon girls said, you have to learn a profession where you can earn money. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">I hadn’t really considered that, seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So they told me that I should concentrate on dress design and dressmaking, and they did teach that at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , at the <span class="BUILDING">art school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">So I learned how to draw dresses and how to make patterns, very basic patterns. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And I took an exam while at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of arts and crafts for the [indecipherable] of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and I got a degree in fashion at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I was still very young, and enjoyed doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">However, after about two years at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , they said you now have to take a job and earn money. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And that’s rather difficult in the fashion field, especially when you have no background. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">So one of the ladies from the committee of The Beacon in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> had dresses made at a very fancy <span class="BUILDING">couturier shop</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaquemar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So I had -- they told me I would have a -- get a job at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaquemar</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And my brother lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> by that time, so that was a very good thing for both of us, because that -- from that time on, my brother and I were always in touch, I think we saw each other daily.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">QUESTION:  Now, just to go back, when you arrived to The <span class="BUILDING">Beacon</span> , were most of the other girls at the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">ANSWER:  All the children were Jewish, all the children were refugee children like myself, and they all had different stories to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Some were with very good guardians and some were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">So we -- we knew all about each other, we were like a group of sisters, and I would say we still are. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Half of them now live in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and ha -- maybe half in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and a few are in different parts of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">But th -- all the children had a similar background. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Now, the interesting part is that I had a friend in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , her name at The <span class="BUILDING">Beacon</span> was Sylvia Balbera. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">Her married name was Schneider, Sylvia Schneider. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> until last year, she passed away. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">If you asked Sylvia about the years at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> , she would give you a completely different story about how dreadful it was, not only the food, but the way we were dressed, and that nobody loved us, and nobody cared. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And yet, I look at the same years as saying they were productive. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">They made us realize what is important in life and what is not so important in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Cause we had next to nothing, and yet we had each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I think it taught us a great deal about the values of what is important and what isn’t important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">QUESTION:  Did you also feel more comfortable being around Jewish friends again? </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Did that make a difference to you at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="661">ANSWER:  I think it gave all of us a certain comfort knowing, for instance, on a Friday night we could have prayers over the bread and wine, and basic things that I remembered from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="662">I think I was pretty much the leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">They said I was very much of a leader type person. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">When the s- superior there said that to me, I didn’t know what she was talking about, but in life she was actually quite correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="665">QUESTION:  So, while you were at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> , what did you have to -- you -- you started to talk about how you eventually learned you needed to make money, but while you were still studying at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> , what -- how were you taken care of in terms of money? </span><span class="sentence" id="666">Were the Allens sending you money, and -- and what did you need in those days in terms of money?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="667">ANSWER:  I don’t remember receiving money from the Allens, although I visited them, I would say, about twice a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">I would go to get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> -- you had to get pol -- permission from the police department that you were leaving your <span class="BUILDING">residence</span> , since we were known as enemy aliens all during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">All the children were enemy aliens, cause we were not British subjects. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">But that was not difficult, to get the permit to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">So I would go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> I would get on one of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> , to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochdale</span> , to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manchester</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rochdale</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And most of the drivers knew me from the time I was a little girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">So I did visit the Allens on a somewhat regular basis, and they always wrote to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">But now The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Beacon</span> really was our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="675">The one thing I need to mention is that when I was told that I need to have a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , Mrs. Hayward, who was the cook, had her son and daughter-in-law as visitors most weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And they came there by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> with a young couple, to stay with her because there was a lot of bombing going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">This was the height of the war, and the doodlebugs, which are one kind of bomb, would come over the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> , and they had <span class="BUILDING">balloon barrages</span> up to prevent the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> from reaching <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">However, this couple, Hayward, Alec Hayward -- Alec Hayward, right, and Agnes, would come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> most weekends. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And Alec was an artist. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">So he and I would do some sketching together. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">We would draw The Beacon, or we would draw a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , or whatever, and I got to know this couple quite well. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">So Mr. Hayward, this is the young Mr. Hayward, said to me, where are you going to live when you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And I said I don’t know yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">I did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So he said, well if you would like, you can live with us because we have a small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Wickham</span> , which is just outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and we have an extra <span class="INT_SPACE">bedroom</span> , and if you like you can stay with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And that is what I did, I then lived with the Haywards in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I did not make enough money to pay for the train fare, and I paid a little bit to the Haywards for <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board, it wasn’t very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">But the <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span> helped out at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span> paid the ou -- the Haywards something towards my keep. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And I earned 35 shillings at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaquemar</span> , and I learned the dress trade from the bottom up. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">I started by picking up the pins off the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> with a magnet, and then they let me put in some basting threads, and take out basting threads. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I was allowed to do little things, but gradually I learned more and more. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> one learned a profession by being an apprentice. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">It’s not necessarily a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="695">At the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I had learned the pattern making and design part of it, but -- End of Tape Two, Side A Beginning Tape Two, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">This is tape number two, side B. I wanted to just go back a little bit and ask you -- back to your childhood memories in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , can you tell me -- I know you mentioned a little bit about going to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , but in the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , what are some of the favorite holidays that you remember? </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Do you have vivid memories of holidays at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">ANSWER:  Oh absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">The holidays were really celebrated and we looked forward to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">The dress would be made for what to wear on a high holiday such as Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Course, a child is growing all the time, but it was a very festive time for any of the high holidays. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">But every Shabbat was a high holiday in my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because Shabbat is every week, and everybody would get dressed accordingly, and even the photo that I have, the men are wearing ties, including my brother, and I would be asked to sing a certain song, which 1s from the fr -- prayer after meals [indecipherable] and I would sing that on a Friday night, and that was entertainment for my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">But holidays were always celebrated, whether it was Purim, where children get dressed accordingly and have these Purim parties, the story of [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I remember all these things from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> days, it’s a long time ago.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="705">QUESTION:  And you remember Passovers as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">ANSWER:  Passover, my mother would start a week before, getting out the new dishes, the other dishes that would be used only for Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">They were white with just a navy blue frame and a little gold around. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">They would just be used for Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And I remember my grandfather, Opa, going around the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with a feather, and going into the corners to see if there’s a crumb anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">These are childhood memories from way back, and I’m surprised that after 70 - something years I still remember such little details. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">But the holidays were really something to look forward to. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">The various holidays, the Simchas Torah, where children get candies in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and we’re allowed to come downstairs to be where the men are, which was a big treat. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And that same <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> today has just one <span class="DLF">wall</span> left, but they’re picking up the pieces and trying to reconstruct whatever they can of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> the way the original <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">QUESTION:  And I think you mentioned this in one of your other -- excuse me -- interviews, but I was curious, could you tell me a little bit about what your parents maybe said to you about being Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Did you feel special, did you feel different in some way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">ANSWER:  We were always told that we are special, and I grew up feeling that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">There’s no way anyone could have changed my religion, even though I was just a little over 10 years old when I left my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="718">But I knew that that was a very important part of my life, and I also knew that I would never marry anyone who was not Jewish, because I could not bring up children in any other faith. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">It was already deeply imbedded in -- as part of my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">QUESTION:  And what about -- I believe you wore the Star of David around your neck and can you tell me what happened when you moved to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">ANSWER:  [had this little Star of David, Mogen Dovid in silver, silver filigree, it’s quite small, insignificant, on a silver chain. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And I wore it when I left my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , when I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Of course, when I started going to the <span class="BUILDING">convent high school</span> , was the name of the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> I went to where my guardians sent me, they of course realized that the Mogen Dovid was not appropriate to go to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="724">So I was told then that I could not wear it at all, and I never did, but I always kept the Mogen Dovid. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">So I had it for years and years. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Whenever I would look at it, it brought back memories, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Many years later, it would now be 19 years ago, our son Steven got married to Susan, Susan Soto. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Susan was not born Jewish, but she became Jewish before Miranda their daughter was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">So when j -- when Susan converted to Judaism, and that is in Florida, I don’t know the exact year, but it is 19 years ago, Susan went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> with her husband, our son Steven, because there was no mikvah in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Palm Beach</span> , so the rabbi was there at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> with Susan, who was pregnant with their daughter Miranda, and Steven said, you know, my wife is pregnant, I can’t put her in any further. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And the rabbi said further, she has to go down more. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">She had just had her hair done for the wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Said further, she has to go down further. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And Susan went to the so-called mikvah in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ocean</span> , she was converted to Judaism, and Susan received the Mogen Dovid, which I was not allowed to wear as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And Susan has the Mogen Dovid very proudly, and will pass it on to Miranda one day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="735">QUESTION:  That’s so nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">So, now when you are at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> -- I know that’s where we left off, with you at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> , and I wanted to just try to establish, what were some of the other kinds of changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">You told me about the air raids, I believe, or maybe you might want to speak a little more about that, but what other changes since the war had started, how -- how were things changing with -- with the war going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="738">ANSWER:  The war was a very difficult time for everyone in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="739">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> they had the major air raids, where huge <span class="REGION">areas</span> were bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">But <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> was in direct <span class="DLF">line</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="741">So the bombs and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , which were called doodlebugs -- they didn’t have pilots, 1t was just a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> with a bomb that would come over. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">In the area of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> and surrounding <span class="REGION">farm country</span> , they put up these huge <span class="DLF">lines</span> on different levels, and balloons, this cal -- they were called balloon barrage, hoping that they would entangle the flight of any one of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> so that they would not reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And indeed, quite a few f - fl -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were intercepted. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Another thing which was typical of a doodlebug is that it would go so many miles and we would hear this droning voi -- noise. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">You knew what it was, but when the noise stopped, that’s when the agony went off in all of us, because we didn -- it was coming down, but we didn’t know where it would come down and explode. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">It was really meant to go another 35 miles to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> from where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">But the way of life for everybody was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">We had the air raids at night or during the day and people would rush into <span class="BUILDING">shelters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And the food was rationed so that it was very minimal, what everyone received. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">But being at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> , the food was less than minimal. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">They did not give us, I think, what we were entitled to, which was maybe one egg a month, because I don’t remember ever, ever eating an egg, or ever seeing fresh fruit like an orange or banana. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I did not see those things all the war years, not until I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">QUESTION:  And what about the correspondence with your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="754">If you can sort of characterize what that correspondence was like through this time period. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">We talked a little bit about, I think, the early days with the Allens --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">QUESTION:  -- but going from the Allens to The <span class="BUILDING">Beacon</span> , and when you heard from them, and then when you didn’t hear from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">ANSWER:  There was very, very little information for my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">The letters dwindled because they were still sending them to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , and they would be forwarded to my brother or my aunt, and then eventually they would come to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">The letters were always sad, it was always we are trying to get out, we are trying to get by. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And my mother would use the phrase very often lorg zundt, only -- only good health. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">In other words, she was hoping that they would stay healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">I know that because I donated all the letters from my parents, the originals, to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> , and -- except for the first and last letter, which we kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">My daughter-in-law in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> has the first and last letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">The first one was particularly meaningful to me, and the last letter from my parents said we have to be at the <span class="BUILDING">dorm</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> -- the <span class="BUILDING">dorm</span> being the big <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in the center of th -- of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , at something like five o’clock in the morning, or something -- something very early, and we may take with us only a rucksack. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And I understand that all the Jews assembled there, and that was in the last letter from my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">They had to then give up their keys, their house keys, and they were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">This was all unknown to us because my brother and I were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and we only heard about that later on, after the war, and from the little <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , and they have the information from some of the soldiers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , and that is how they received the names of all the people who were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">But you know, the Germans were very accurate about their recordkeeping, so they have records of names and so forth, and that is all recorded now on that monument in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">QUESTION:  When did that last letter come to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">ANSWER:  I believe it was in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And then from where they went we never heard. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Maybe there was a Red Cross letter, but I’m really not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I’m only aware of this particular letter from my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And we were hoping that when the war was over, we would find them maybe in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , or someplace, but it never happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">QUESTION:  Did you -- did they seem to know at all where they were going to be sent, in that letter?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">ANSWER:  I don’t think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I don’t think they knew where they were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">They just wrote that they all have to be there early in the morning and that was the fine -- the last letter that I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">So the -- those two letters are in -- with our son and daughter-in-law in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="780">All the other letters are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> , and wis -- the y-young lady in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , Jutta Dick, who runs that little <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , called <span class="BUILDING">Moses Mendelssohn academy</span> , she asked for copies of all those letters, and received them with my okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">So she has the details of all of these letters, which I never read again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">QUESTION:  Never?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">ANSWER:  Never, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">Only the first and the last. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">So, I did not want to read all those letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">I found them to be very depressing, and it was a subject that in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , we just did not discuss.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="787">QUESTION:  And what -- what about keeping your diary? </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Did you continue writing in the diary when you were at the Allen’s and at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="789">What do you -- what do you remember about the diary?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">ANSWER:  The diary, which was started in German, for a long time all the writing was in German, in green ink, and then it continued later on in blue, I believe, ink, and a completely different handwriting. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">You would not think it was the same person, and now it’s in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And very positive, that was at the time I was at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> already, when I wrote just a few more pages in very good English and a completely different attitude, a much more positive attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="793">QUESTION:  And also at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> , were you interested in boys at this time of your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="794">ANSWER:  Oh, we had a lot of fun with the local boys, we really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">The Beacon girls were very popular with the neighborhood village boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">The <span class="BUILDING">Beacon</span> being rather an isolated <span class="BUILDING">building</span> on a <span class="DLF">hill</span> , the <span class="REGION">area</span> is called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rusthall</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> , and it’s still called The Beacon. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">It is now like a <span class="BUILDING">pub</span> , and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and breakfast both. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">So it’s well taken care of by a young couple at this time, because after our reunion of children being in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for 50 years, we went onto <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> , and visited <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And at that time some of the village boys were invited to come over. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">These village boys are now in their fi -- 60’s, but we knew them as kids. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And they would come and visit us by climbing through the <span class="DLF">basement window</span> , which was ground level. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And when we heard a matron coming down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , they would jump out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> and disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">So we had a very good, but very innocent time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="804">QUESTION:  Okay, so now I think we’re caught up, and we were last talking about The <span class="DLF">Beacon</span> and your transition from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Do you know when that was, and maybe now you want to just start over and talk about living with the Haywards, I believe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="806">ANSWER:  I believe the year would have been 1946 approximately, because I was now out of the school of arts and crafts in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> , and had to take a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And the young Mr. Hayward, who was this artist, said to me, would I like to live with them -- of course with the okay of his young wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And I didn't know where I was going to live, so that sounded fine to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">They said they would live -- they were living in the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , a little on the outskirts. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">So then I started my job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaquemar</span> , this very, very fancy dress house, which gave me a very, very good background in basic knowledge of dressmaking, which came in extremely useful later on in my life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="811">QUESTION:  So this was -- this was actually already after the war, or is this while the war is still going on? </span><span class="sentence" id="812">Cause you --
ANSWER:  The war was -- the war was still going on, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="813">QUESTION:  Okay, so probably not ’46, so it must have been earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">ANSWER:  Maybe fort -- ’45 to ’46 that I stayed with the -- with the Haywards. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">I don’t know the exact date any more, but I was with them when the war ended, so I was still going to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and being that I was working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jaquemar</span> , my brother was also working in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , not too far away, and we would le -- meet at lunchtime, and we would meet at a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> called Lions, <span class="BUILDING">Lions Corner House</span> , and my brother would always pay for my lunches. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I really d -- earned very, very little money. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">It wasn’t even enough to pay for the train fare and staying with the Haywards. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">But the Haywards had a very positive influence upon my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">For instance, I had had piano lessons in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and they felt that I should continue with my knowledge of music, and made arrangements for me to have piano lessons every week, which I did, and I went to high s -- to further my education in art, I went to an <span class="BUILDING">art school</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">So I would work during the day, commute, and then go to an <span class="BUILDING">evening art school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="821">So they really influenced my life in continuing my education, and I was very happy staying with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">They were not at all wealthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">They bought me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">men’s bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I know because it had the <span class="BUILDING">bar</span> in between, and we used to visit <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> , now from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and we used to bicycle there. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">It was 35 miles each way. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And Alec and his wife Agnes had a tandem and I had the single <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">men’s bike</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="827">So they were slow going uphill, where I would be ahead of them and going downhill they would be much faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And 35 miles in one <span class="NPIP">direction</span> is quite a good trip, but we did this quite regularly and it helped me in having very strong legs to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">QUESTION:  And that’s still while the war was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">ANSWER:  Yes, the war was still going on, and when the war was over, I was still with the Haywards on the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And I must say one day when I was supposed to take the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> after work from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Charing Cross</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Wickham</span> where they lived, I missed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , which could happen when you work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was hit by a bomb, and they thought I was on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And I guess the good lord felt that I wa -- he wasn’t ready for me, so here I was saved once more, and it was the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that I had taken on a regular basis, and that day I missed it, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">QUESTION:  And that’s before the war ended?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">ANSWER:  That was before the war ended, yes, and I was still with the Haywards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="836">QUESTION:  Did these sorts of things scare you at the time, or did you take them in stride in a certain way?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="837">ANSWER:  When you live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> during the war, you just never knew where the bomb would go off, or when a doodlebug stopped whether it would hit you, or the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next door, or -- 1t would be nearby, but you were just lucky if you made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And we spent many, many nights in the <span class="BUILDING">air raid shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">The Haywards had a shelter in their <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">It was about the size of a ten -- <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ping pong table</span> , but out of iron, and you would sleep under that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ping pong table</span> the moment the air raid siren went off. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">And it was routine. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">That could be daytime or nighttime. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">Of course, everything was a blackout at all times. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">No lights from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , you could not see which <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had a light on. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And they had air raid wardens walking around, checking each of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846">It was a way of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , many people just bedded down in the underground, which is the subway system. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">They had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> , one on top of the other, and parents, rather than dragging their children out in the middle of the night, would just put them to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And they would be there every night, occupying these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="850">There were hundreds and hundreds of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">QUESTION:  But still, you somehow weren’t terribly frightened, it sounds like.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">ANSWER:  Yeah -- no, I think I took the life pretty much in stride, like that’s the way it’s meant to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And I think even to this day, we are planning to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> next week, and it’s not a very safe time, since we just got over this war maybe two weeks ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And I feel whenever the hot time is to go, that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Meantime, I’m positive about living -- about living every day to the fullest.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">QUESTION:  So what do you remember about the war coming to an end?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">ANSWER:  I remember the huge celebrations in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , but I was not in -- in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> then. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">My only recollection is really that my brother said to me, it is time for us to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Our parents said that we will meet them again in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="860">And we were still hoping that there would be a sign of our parents somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">We thought because of lack of communication during the whole war, that maybe they were hiding somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">Maybe in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , or somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">We did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">But we were not fortunate. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">However, many of The Beacon girls were reunited with their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Some in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , some in <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , and different parts of the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="867">QUESTION:  How did you feel about the possibility at this stage, going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="868">ANSWER:  By now I felt very English. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">I really didn’t want to leave <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">But my brother had this attitude of being responsible for me, and he said, this 1s what our parents wanted, and that’s what we’re going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">He really did not give me a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I was about 18 by now, and he said, this is what my par -- our parent’s wishes were, and we’re able to go because now the quota number had come to pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">In other words, we are entitled to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">And my uncle who was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> had given us the appropriate visa and my brother made the arrangements for us to go, and I believe that <span class="BUILDING">Bloomsbury House</span> paid for part of the voyage by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">QUESTION:  When did you leave for the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">ANSWER:  It was in 1946, that I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I came on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> called the Drakninghome, and fell in love on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> with a man from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , which sounded very, very far away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="878">But he was much older than I, but it was sort of a quick romance, but that’s as far as it went.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="879">QUESTION:  What was his name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="880">ANSWER:  Bill, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And my husband when he heard about Bill, and that Bill was coming to visit me, was very upset.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">QUESTION:  So you remember the journey fondly, going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">ANSWER:  Yes, the journey was a very happy crossing for me, it was a very broadening experience to say the least, however I was still listening to my mother, which I learned later on what that was all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">The journey though, was a very happy one and we finally reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and my brother was here to greet me, he came before I did, and an aunt of mine were at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> when I arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And I spent the first couple of days at my uncle’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="886">The uncle is my mother’s brother, Hans Marcuza. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">Hans Marcuza was married not too long, and had a little girl called Barbara. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">So now I met my first cousin for the first time, and she was just a couple of months old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">QUESTION:  What were your very first impressions coming into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">ANSWER:  I was not too pleased. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">My brother was showing me the <span class="BUILDING">skyscrapers</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hudson</span> and saying how wonderful and how beautiful, but I was used to a simple life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> , really the -- a country life, and I found all the brick and stone and the masses of people overwhelming.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="892">QUESTION:  After that, how did you assimilate and adjust to being a new immigrant here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="893">ANSWER:  I soon realized that I could not stay with my uncle too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">I think I stayed with him at the most for two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">At the time there was a newspaper in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and I believe it is still in existence, called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aufbau</span> , A-u-f-b-a-u. The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aufbau</span> also played a role in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">First day I found a <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> , which cost five dollars a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">So, it was a walk-up apartment and I just had this tiny little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there on <span class="DLF">180" Street</span> , with a family. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And of course, I needed to look for a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">So I went to an <span class="BUILDING">unemployment agency</span> , the regular <span class="BUILDING">U.S. unemployment agency</span> , and there was a very nice gentleman there who was sort of fascinated by my background, which I did not find particularly fascinating at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And he helped me to get my first job in sketching bridal gowns. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">S -- my first job was on <span class="DLF">85" Street</span> , very near the mu -- Metropolitan Museum of Art. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And people would explain to me what they want, a dress with lots of buttons down the back and puffed sleeves or whatever, and I would sketch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And I was a pretty good sketcher, and I had a -- quite a nice background from the <span class="BUILDING">school of art</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tunbridge Wells</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">showroom</span> and people who would make the dresses, but my particular job was to sketch. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">Later on I would get a second job, and a third job, and each one was an improvement over the job I had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">I always earned more money, and I did quite well money-wise. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">I know I started with 35 dollars a week, and my brother and I thought that that was incredible. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">We thought we were so well-to-do. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">At that time I guess it was not too bad, because my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was only five dollars, so we did fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And my brother and I saw each other regularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">He also took a furnished room in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington Heights</span> , we were near each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And we were always very, very close in our loving each other, and -- but my brother felt responsible for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And it wasn’t too much longer, when I visited my other uncle, Dr. Friedel Lusch, he was a gynecologist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , on <span class="DLF">92 Street</span> and <span class="DLF">Columbus Avenue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And I went to visit Friedel Lusch, Uncle Friedel, and there were other people there, a Mrs. Lowenstein and her daughter, and a young man, and this young man was Jerry. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">I thought he might be the husband of the other young woman, turned out that that was his first cousin, and that was the aunt he lived with when he came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , also on the kindertransport. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And that’s where I first met my husband Jerry, and I was only here maybe a month or not much more and Jerry has not left me out of his sight from then until today, and we are married 58 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="917">QUESTION:  What year did you get married?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="918">ANSWER:  We met in °46, got married in ’48, had our first child in fi -- End of Tape Two, Side B Beginning Tape Three, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">This is tape number three, side A. As you were saying before, a lot of things were happening to you in your first years in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="920">ANSWER:  I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in 1946, and that is when I met my husband-to-be, Jerry. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And in 1948 we got married. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">In 1950 we had our first son, Steven, and in 1952 we had our second son, Ralph. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">So every two years, an important event happened 1n our lives.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="924">QUESTION:  So it sounds like you adjusted pretty well to your new life in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S</span> .. Would you say so?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="925">ANSWER:  I got used to life in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> quite quickly, even though my first impulse was not so enthusiastic, I got used to the life here, which is of course, much more pleasant than the life that I had been accustomed to in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for all the war years. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">I had never seen such an abundance of fruit and flowers, and wealth that I had seen here, because we grew up in a very modest way, which I’m not too sorry about because I believe it has given us a different perspective in life, knowing what is an important thing in life, and what isn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">And it’s not the wealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="928">QUESTION:  So at this stage of your life, would you have felt more German, or more British in your sort of national identity or -- or background, if you will.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="929">ANSWER:  I never really felt German any more after I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , I got very used to living in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and would have rather stayed there, but my brother insisted upon coming here. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">However, once I met my husband and we were married, I was able to become an American citizen because my husband was in the American army during the war, and I became a citizen within the first year of our marriage, and I would not change that for anything 1n the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="931">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about the reunion I think you had, back in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="932">ANSWER:  I don’t remember the exact year, but after 50 years of children coming to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on the kindertransport, Bertha Leverton wrote t -- an article in some newspaper, saying she is looking for contributions of letters from youngsters who came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on the kindertransport, and she put together a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">The book is called, “I Came Alone” and it has stories of at least 300 children within that book. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And sh -- then she decided that we should give some sort of acknowledgement and thanks to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for having brought us to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for our safety, because without that, none of us would have survived, or maybe very few. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">But this way, whether we were happy or not, cause some children were and some were not, I was among the luckier ones, but some children while they were in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> were used as maids, some were used as sex objects, they were not all very lucky, and -- with the choice of their guardians. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">But I got accustomed to living in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> a -- quite quickly, and that has become our way of life, and of course our children are born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and they don’t know anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">QUESTION:  And how did it feel to go back to this reunion? </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Was it emotional for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="939">ANSWER:  It was emotional for many of us, because it brought back things that we would just as soon not think about. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Everybody was talking about their past, they had groups together who lived in different parts of <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> so that they would have a chance to meet again. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And people came from different parts of the world to this particular reunion in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="942">And that was the beginning of other chapters of the kindertransport starting up. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">There is an organization in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> called kindertransport link, I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">They have a newsletter for all the people who were children who came to the <span class="REGION">New York area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="945">But that happened also in <span class="REGION">California</span> and in Florida. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">So they have different groups of people getting together on a regular basis, who were all children who came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> with the kindertransport.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="947">QUESTION:  And when you were back in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> for this reunion, did you go to <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">ANSWER:  We did. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">Those of us who were there from <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> , that might have been about 12 or 15 Beacon girls and their husbands, because now, most people were married and with children at this ti -- point. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">So, many husbands came along, and we all visited <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> for one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">It was closed to the public, and of course it was written up in many newspapers. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">But The <span class="BUILDING">Beacon</span> still exists, and it brought back a lot of memories, because that which are now elegant <span class="INT_SPACE">dining rooms</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> and white tablecloths, and very, very pretty, and a beautiful setting, that was our <span class="BUILDING">dormitory</span> , that was our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and that’s where the Rusthall boys came to visit us. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">So it brought back a lot of memories.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="954">QUESTION:  How many girls in total were at <span class="BUILDING">The Beacon</span> when you were there, do you know approximately?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="955">ANSWER:  At least 50, in different -- different ages, and they were divided up into junior, middles and seniors. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">I started as a middle and ended as a senior.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="957">QUESTION:  Now, when you arrived to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , were you still hopeful that you would find your parents, or hear from your parents?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="958">ANSWER:  By the time I got to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , there was little hope, because we had not heard anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">But we heard from s -- some people -- I mentioned the name Ruth Lindheimer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , the girl I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> with, she was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> also with the kindertransport, but her father was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and he was in the American army, he served in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And Ruth’s father knew of other people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> who are also living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , so he had some contact with other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And they somehow received a list which was published in the Aufbau newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And in that list, which a soldier had on him, the soldier had the list of these people, an American soldier, I believe, and he gave it to the Aufbau, the Aufbau published it. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">It had the names of all the people who were transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , which we did not know, we never really knew where they were transported to.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="964">QUESTION:  So this is the first concrete information --
ANSWER:  Mm-hm, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">QUESTION:  -- and then, did you know where they may have gone, or -- when did you find out anything else, or did you find out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="966">ANSWER:  [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">We actually never found out anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">We don’t know a specific date when they were possibly killed, but we just don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">All we know is the monument which 1s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">dome</span> where all the Jewish people had to assemble to be deported, and it has the date of birth, and it doesn’t have a date of death.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">QUESTION:  And so it sounds like that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , did anyone ever find out if that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> when to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , or it went somewhere else?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="971">ANSWER:  Went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="972">It went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , they all went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , that’s all we know. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">What -- we- we don’t know any details after that and I don’t think that there were even any Red Cross letters, any more from the camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">But in my -- the last letter from parents, they wrote that Oma in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stargard</span> , the -- that’s the other grandmother, and her daughter, were also deported to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , but we don’t know any details. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">We also don’t know what happened to Opa in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , the one who lived above us. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">I believe he was sent to like a <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> , but we were trying to find his <span class="DLF">grave</span> when we were there a few years ago, and we could not find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">We found the <span class="DLF">grave</span> of his wife, Zelma Cohn, and it’s in the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="978">It’s written in Hebrew, and a rabbi, a present rabbi from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> made a rubbing of the gravestone and sent us the translation, which was really quite warm and heartwarming. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">So that was Zelma Cohn, born Lusch. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And that gravestone is there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , but we could not find Opa, Hugo Cohn, we don’t know where he was buried.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="981">QUESTION:  But your grandmother, when did she pass away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="982">ANSWER:  When I was about two or three years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">So that was a normal burial.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="984">QUESTION:  So was there any point at which it really sank in for you that you wouldn’t see your parents again, and when was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="985">ANSWER:  There wasn’t really any one particular day or one particular time. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">The only thing that we know concrete is the list of names that they were deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">So we know they were there, and we know very few survivors came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="988">We just never heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="989">QUESTION:  And so the last time that you saw them was at that <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="990">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">The last picture I have is the picture in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> on the day that I departed on the kindertransport. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And my parents came with me until <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> , where the actual <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , which was a locked <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , they just took the children for the transport, no parents were allowed on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> at that time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="993">QUESTION:  Now this photo, plus I know other photos are items that you’ve been able to hold onto for the rest of your life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="994">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="995">QUESTION:  Can you tell me, just about the photos right now, how it is that you managed to do that, and that one photo from the <span class="BUILDING">train station</span> , did you have that throughout, or was that sent to you at some point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="996">ANSWER:  My parents sent it to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> just as soon as I got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">They sent it to the Allens, and I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with a considerable number of old photographs, family photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">They have been copied and reproduced, and a -- the copies are in the little <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">Moses Mendelssohn academy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="999">But I have the originals right here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1000">QUESTION:  And so you probably always felt that it was very important to -- to hold onto these photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">Did you feel that from a very young age already?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1002">ANSWER:  Yes, I always felt that that is my heritage, that these were the most precious things to me, and these are items that cannot be reproduced, I mean, if I would lose them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">And I thought I did this year, because I had the young lady from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> visiting us here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , we were sitting at this same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> in our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and we went through my history and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">And when she left, I was looking for the family album, and I couldn't find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">So I called <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> frantically, and yes indeed, she took the whole album, with all these original pictures, and I was very, very upset, and told her so, but she said, well I needed to make copies of them, and how else could I make copies? </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">She took the whole book, and I’m glad to say, it’s back in my hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1007">QUESTION:  And what other objects -- when you did come to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , what other objects from -- from your past did you bring with you at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1008">ANSWER:  The diary which we referred to before, I forgot that I had that, and it showed up quite unexpectedly about -- what it’s -- 1987, that’s many, many years after we -- I was in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I came over in about °46, I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">So until ’87, we moved into the present <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where we are, and by -- in the move, I came across this diary, which I had forgotten that I had, and I though to myself, oh gee, if my children ever see this old book, and the hat I wore when I left my parents on the day I came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , I kept the diary and the hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Why, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And I showed it to our children on a particular Passover when the whole family was together, I said, “I came across these items and someday you’re going to say, why did my mother keep this old hat?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">I said, “Well that’s the hat I wore when I left <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And I donated that hat to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C</span> .. I understand it’s on show there with the picture of my wearing the hat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1014">QUESTION:  And were you surprised when you re-read your diary? </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">Was there anything in there that surprised you, or you hadn’t remembered?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1016">ANSWER:  Yes, I am not one to go back over old letters or old things too happily, because it sometimes brings back unhappy memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">So I would just as soon not really read the old letters, but one day I translated the whole diary into English, because if my children wanted to know what it was in that diary, they wouldn’t understand the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">So I translated it page for page, and marked each page with the number where you can find it in the actual diary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1019">QUESTION:  Was that a difficult process for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1020">ANSWER:  Well, the English and German is not a problem for me because both languages are identical. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">I have no problems speaking either one, but emotionally it brings back things that I’d just as soon not think about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1022">QUESTION:  Do you think that’s helped you in a way, not to dwell on the memories, the bad -- the -- the difficult memories?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1023">ANSWER:  I believe so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">I don’t believe in dwelling on difficult or bad times. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">I would rather think about the positive, but that’s the way I am, it’s the -- my nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1026">QUESTION:  And what about with your children? </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Did you talk much about your experiences as a youngster with your children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1028">ANSWER:  No, didn’t talk about it at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Our children were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">We lived in a small <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Middle Village</span> , and they grew up with all the other neighborhood American children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> in -- in the <span class="DLF">park</span> , very close to <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And actually the conversation never came up, even though my husband and I both speak German fluently, we really did not use the German language. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">My husband was also born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , he was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> , but at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> we just spoke English, with one exception. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">When Jerry’s mother, my husband’s mother came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> after the war and I met her, she didn't speak English, she would speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">And I always understood it, but I hadn’t used the language for so many years in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">So she would say well, why don’t you answer me in German? </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">And I really hesitated to speak German, but the more she insisted and the more she spoke German, I understood everything, and eventually I would speak to her, so the children would hear a little German here and there, when- you know, when the grandmother came to visit, which was every weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">But my husband and I only speak English at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">But a ga -- regarding whether we spoke about our childhood and kindertransport, I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">I don’t think the children were even aware of any of this, except that we visited the Allens with the children when they were about five and six years old, we went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> and visited the Allens, who were, of course, very, very proud to have me back and to see our children, and they were very, very kind to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">And at one time they came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and visited us in our little <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Middle Village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">So there was always this connection, and I told you that I am still in touch with the granddaughter, very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">And just a year ago the granddaughter, with her seven children, came to visit our son in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> , and then to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">So it’s like part of my life is definitely in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1045">QUESTION:  Why do you think you didn’t talk much about this, or at all, with your own children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1046">ANSWER:  I don’t know that it was deliberate, except for the fact that I wanted the children to have a very happy childhood, and I didn't believe in burdening them with anything that was an unpleasant past. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">But the time did come when they started posing questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">And the first question I remember, the boys are only 14 months apart in age, one of them saying at Thanksgiving time, they were now in <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , saying, everybody is going to their grandmother’s and grandfather’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , why don’t we have grandparents? </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">So now the question came from the children, and I told them in short that there was this bad man in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and because of that I came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and I said, you know, Pop and Ma in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , and of course they did, because they had visited and they knew them very well by now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">And I said, well that’s why I came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">But I would make it very short, I never dwelt on it, and neither did my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">It was just, when they asked a question they got a real answer, but we never talked much about politics, we just wanted them to have a happy childhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1053">QUESTION:  So now if you would tell me about what happened with the other items, this sort of surprise phone call that you received, other items that wound up being -- belonging to your family, and that you didn’t even know about.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1054">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">Well, it’s just a -- a little over a year ago, in 2005, and we’re now in 2006, I received a phone call from this woman in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , Jutta Dick at the <span class="BUILDING">Moses Mendelssohn academy</span> , and she said, “Lilly, I had a phone call from somebody called Horst Hesser, do you know Horst Hesser?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And I said, no, I don’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">She said, “Do you know Horst?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">So I thought about it, and I said, “Well the only Horst I know is the doll I had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">My little doll I played with in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was a boy doll, and his name was Horst.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">I said, “That’s the only Horst I know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">But I must have called that Horst after -- that doll after somebody, somebody I liked, but I couldn’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">She said, “Well, Horst Hesser is trying to reach you, and he says he has some items that belong to you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">I said, “No, that can’t be, I -- I just don’t know anybody.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">So she said, “Well, he said he has certain belongings from your parents and he has looked for you all his life, and he just found you through the internet, through the computer.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Well, apparently Horst Hesser has a son-in-law and he is very creative with the computer and Horst has said to him at various times, could you put in the name of either Vanna Cohn or Lilly Cohn and see what happens. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And over the years, nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">And Horst said that when he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , he would always ask, what happened to that family, Cohn, and anyone he would ask would say, we don’t know, or we’d rather not talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">So this time this son-in-law put in the name Lilly Cohn, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , and it came out that it said, Lilly Cohn, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> 1s now Lillyan Rosenberg, tour guide in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">So he was extremely excited and went to see his father-in-law and told him, I think I found her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">So one thing led to another, they contacted the guide association in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and said, do you know Lillyan Rosenberg? </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">And they said, oh sure we do, because of course, they speak different languages and I did tours in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">They said she was president of the multilingual guide association. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">He said, well how can we reach her? </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">So they told him how they could reach me, and that is how Horst called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> and she told me to get in touch with Horst. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">So now I called him, and one f -- morning I called, and of course my German is fluent, and I said to him, “Here is Lilly Cohn.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And he said, “Are you the little girl I played with?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">I said, “I don’t know, I can’t remember.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">He said, “Well, if you are the one,” he said, “our parents were very good friends and they used to have coffee and cake at your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and you and I would play under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and do some crayoning or play.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">I must have been all of seven years old at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And sh -- he said, “While I am speaking to you, I have paintings in front of me, and these paintings were done by your mother, and they have your mother’s signature.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">And so I said, “That can’t be.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">He said, “Yes, I have several items from your parents.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And he told me that his father and my father were doing business together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">So I believe that after my father’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was closed, he still sold linens by going to people’s houses, or business, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">But with a suitcase I remember him getting on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and that was after the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was closed, before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">So apparently he knew this family well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">So ma -- now --
QUESTION:  And where -- and where were they, where did they live?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1088">ANSWER:  They now live in a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwerin</span> , but at the time, his father and my parents lived like 10 miles apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">He -- the father of Horst and family, they lived outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , a real farm country. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Like we have Pennsylvania Dutch, real <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">There’d be one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> here, and a half a mile away, another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">That’s how his parents lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">So apparently, during the war, my father said to Horst’s father, would you come and get some of our precious belongings in case we ever have to leave our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and would you hold them for safekeeping? </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">So apparently, Horst’s father, at great risk to his own life, came in the middle of the night with, I think a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> , and took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and carpeting and silver and paintings, a s -- little statue, and various items from my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and he drove them during the night because nobody would see him where they live, and he hid them in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">So these items were hidden in a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> all the war years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">And of course, eventually, my parents had to leave <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , their ho -- our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And after the war, Horst’s father said to his two sons, who were now teenagers, “We have belongings from a Jewish family, the family Cohn, and I’m trying to find them, and if I don’t find them, I want you to promise me that you will always look for them, and we have to return these items to that family.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">So I couldn’t believe what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">But it was just a year ago in July that we made arrangements then to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> and that Horst and his wife would come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , and then my husband was coming with me, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">And the two sons said, “Well then, we’ll go too, because if you’re going, we’ll go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And the three grandchildren said, “Well if you’re all going, we want to go, too.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">So on July of nine -- of 2 - ‘05, we all arranged to be in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">So it was the two sons, one daughter-in-law, and the three grandchildren and my husband and I, we all went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> and we met Horst and his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">They are also in their 70’s, like I am, but he’s a little bit older, and they’re a very charming couple. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">And we spent a few days with them in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">And there were great festivities, if one may call it that, because there was the press, and television and newscasters, all at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> where this took place. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">And some students, and outsiders. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">It got a tremendous lot of publicity and Horst returned the paintings to me, and a whole set of silverware with the initial C for Cohn, and a little statue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">It took quite awhile, but eventually it reached our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and we are now blessed to have the paintings and the silver and the statue in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1110">QUESTION:  I want to ask you first of all, when’s the first time you ever went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Tell me a little bit about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1112">ANSWER:  Well, I was once in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> when I was working at the German national tourist office, and I acco-companied American tourists to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I was more or less the interpreter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1113">QUESTION:  And when was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1114">ANSWER:  In 19 -- approximately 1974. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">I worked at the ger -- <span class="BUILDING">German tourist office</span> for five years and gave advice to American travel agents and tourists who were thinking of going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">Of course, I don’t remember <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> as such, I only know the map, and I studied that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">But eventually I had to take American travel agents to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and I would have a local tour guide over there explaining things to me in German, and I in turn interpreted it into English.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1118">QUESTION:  So tell me, how did it feel the first time you were back in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , how did that feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1119">ANSWER:  I decided that I will think of it as if I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Scandinavia</span> , because it was all strange to me anyway, and I did not like the idea of going to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and on my own, I would not have gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">But that was business, and I did what I had to do, and it was successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1121">QUESTION:  Did you feel uncomfortable around Germans, especially if they were of a certain age, old enough to have been active during that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1122">ANSWER:  At times very much so, because -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">This is tape number three, side B. So you were telling me about your interaction with every day Germans, I guess whether that first trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , or tourists who came here and any of the discomfort that you may have felt in the earliest times that you can recall?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1124">ANSWER:  I did not go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> voluntarily, but since it was part of my job, I decided that if I didn’t do it, somebody else would be doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And we visited a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Worms</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and my question was to the guide who showed us around, who was wearing a yarmulke, you know, skullcap, a-are there any Jews who ever come here? </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And he said no, there were no Jews who came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Worms</span> , but they built a token <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> like a goodwill, restitution thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">But the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> is used at times by American soldiers who are stationed in the vicinity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">So it was used there, but otherwise there were no Jews who came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Worms</span> , which was a very active Jewish community before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1129">QUESTION:  So that was your trip in the 70’s, is that right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1130">ANSWER:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1131">QUESTION:  And then you were starting to tell me about perhaps feeling uncomfortable, even German tourists -- did 1t make you uncomfortable sometimes to meet Germans who you wondered about what they had done during the war time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1132">ANSWER:  Well, very often they would ask me political questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">Now that I was dealing with them -- with German tourists in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">But I -- I would turn that around very quickly by saying, my job 1s to tell you about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and I want to tell you about the <span class="BUILDING">Empire State building</span> , or the <span class="BUILDING">Chrysler building</span> , or whatever, and I never really went into my background. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">It was only once, when German tourists introduced themselves on one of my longer tours, where I have people coming up to the mic, and they say, I was a teacher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , and the other one says, oh I’m also from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , so they got to know each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And this one woman said she’s from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">So that took me by surprise, and I didn’t know just how to handle that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And I did not tell her that I was born there until the last day when I took them to <span class="BUILDING">Kennedy airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">I decided on my way there that I would dec -- would tell her about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And I asked her what kind of work they were doing, and she said, we made uniforms in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">So I wasn't too happy, and I did not want that to be the conversation on the whole tour, because I’m dealing with Germans, and Australians, or Austrians and English, they could all be in one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> , but I really didn’t want to have that as a conversation piece. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">So in general I avoided having these kind of conversations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1143">QUESTION:  Now when’s the next time you went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and what were the circumstances of that journey?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1144">ANSWER:  We got this letter from Jutta Dick from the <span class="BUILDING">Moses Mendelssohn academy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , saying we would like to invite you to come over to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and this was approximately year 2000, approximately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And she said, would we be willing to address some of the students of the vicinity, and it was mainly because of the diary I kept, because I sent a copy of the diary, I think it’s about 66 pages, I sent a copy to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , because they’re trying to show what life was like in that community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">And that tagabu, this diary of mine, which I have right here, became a textbook for the students in the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And they studied my background and the way of life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">So she asked if I would address students and come over there and s -- that they could a -- meet somebody and speak to me directly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">So my friend Ruth Oppenheimer, who I mentioned before, and her husband, and my husband Jerry and I, and one lady from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , her naveda -- name is Judith Beerun, and she goes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> fr -- quite frequently from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , she is older than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">We were all in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> together, and we had interviews, mostly at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and sometimes at a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> where students of a -- an age about 16 to 20 -- not the youn -- very youngest, could ask questions, anything they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">And being that my German is quite fluent, they -- they would speak to me and give -- and I would answer their questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">I also offered them that if they had any questions that they could write to me and I would answer their letters, which indeed I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">One of the letters which is outstanding in my mind is where a young student wrote to me, of course all in German, I was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and wherever I go in the world, wherever my parents and I travel, people always refer to us as Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">What can I do about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">After all, I wasn’t even born. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">What can I help what my grandfather may have done, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">So I gave it quite a bit of thought how to answer such a letter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">And I wrote back and I answered every letter, but this came up in several versions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">And I said, you know, you are not responsible for things that happened before you were born. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">But you’re very responsible for all the decisions you make in your lifetime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">And therefore, all I can tell you is that you do not have to feel guilty for things that happened before your time, but be very sure that whatever decisions you make in your life will be the right decision, and not only because of the majority doing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">So I ho-hope that I gave the youngsters the proper advice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1163">QUESTION:  Did you feel -- on these trips to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , did you feel a certain inevitable resentment toward Germans, toward <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1164">ANSWER:  I must carry on for what I just said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">I feel that the young people are not responsible for that which happened before their time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">I look at the old people in a different way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And yet I feel life must go on, and we must be positive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">I cannot say that one can ever forget the type of childhood that I had because of the loss of my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">I cannot forgive them for that, but I cannot hold it against all the Germans, because I think they’re doing the best they can to help <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and I have found many, many positive things, including some very, very good people, including this Horst and his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">They had, for instance, the various pieces of silver for my parents, which my parents might have hidden somewhere, I don’t know, and that was distributed among the various members of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">And yet when they heard that we were coming to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they all gave it back and we have all these things from all the various members. </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">So there are many good people, and we have to realize that and go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1173">QUESTION:  What about Horst himself? </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">During the war time, was he of age to be in the German army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1175">ANSWER:  I believe he was first in the Hitlerjugen -- youth -- children’s you -- Hitler youth, and later on he was in the German army, and he was imprisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">And he is quite a character, and when we visited him in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schwerin</span> , which is where they live now, there’s this old <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> , and he showed us the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> , and he said, I was imprisoned 1n that <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> and I jumped out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> over there and trotted for miles and miles and miles along the <span class="DLF">train track</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">And he told us the weirdest stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">I mean, he’s quite a character, but they’re very, very good people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Yes, he was in the German army, and it wasn’t until the war was over that his father told his sons that they have the items belonging to my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1180">QUESTION:  Now, in particular, you said there are paintings by your mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">Can you describe the paintings that you received from Horst?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1182">ANSWER:  Well, when I first saw the painting, when we met Horst last year, I realized that I had a photograph from my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because I had quite a few old photographs, but on that one photograph is the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> of my parents, and in the corner of the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , on the one corner, is this big painting, and that is the painting that he had, and another, smaller one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">Also, I had one painting in my suitcase for the Allens, so it was a pr -- a pr -- a present from my mother to the Allens when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , so there was always one small painting, which is in our son’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , the Allens gave it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And now we have the two big paintings which Horst gave us, and of course it has changed our whole atmosphere in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , they just look like they belong there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1185">QUESTION:  Describe them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">What are they paintings of, the three in total?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1187">ANSWER:  The one which my son in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> has is of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hartz mountains</span> , and it’s a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and going over a lot of stones and just countryside. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">The other one 1s -- the very large one, 1s a big <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stargard</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pommern</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">Horst’s wife did some research by going to various <span class="BUILDING">libraries</span> to locate which <span class="BUILDING">church</span> could that be, and she located it as the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stargard</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pommern</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And the smaller picture is the <span class="BUILDING">fish mart</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , which is still there now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">There is a round <span class="DLF">fountain</span> in the center of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and that seems to be quite a landmark with Bucco from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> in the background on the new <span class="BUILDING">town hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">Because the new <span class="BUILDING">town hall</span> was bombed, but they must have had Bucco hidden somewhere, Bucco 1s still there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1193">QUESTION:  How did it feel for you to be in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">I guess the first time you were there was 2001? </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">Or --
ANSWER:  No, just e -- no --
QUESTION:  -- you didn’t go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">Describe when you first --
ANSWER:  We came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> a -- because we met our children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> since the whole family was joining us to meet Horst. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I had never been back to hal -- oh no, I had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> when we spoke to the students, and I was very much afraid that I would feel very badly when I would see my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">But when we got to my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and they told me this is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westendorf</span> , and the exact address, the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> is still there, but vis-a-vis the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> where my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> was is now a very ugly <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which was built by the Russians in their style of <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , which was very unattractive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">Like a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> type <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">So I did not associate with that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">I had no feeling for that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">So that which I was afraid of, never happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1203">QUESTION:  Let’s see what other questions I wanted to ask you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">So, on -- is there anything else you wanted to mention in terms of the reunion with -- with Horst? </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">Anything else that -- that we haven’t covered? </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">Cause I know that was a very -- I mean, this was really a dramatic development, I mean something that just really took you by surprise, 1t seems.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1207">ANSWER:  Absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">And it -- 1t was an absolute surprise, but I must say, it was one of the more pleasant surprises in my lifetime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">Cause no one could have ever predicted that over 70 years would -- would come -- go by and someone would come up and say, I have belongings from your parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">I mean, it was something that I could not have even dreamt up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">It’s just so unpredictable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">And then they turned out to be such warm and kind people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">So that I speak to Horst every week, even it’s a year now that we are back from over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And his son-in-law writes to us on the email, so we know what is happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">In fact, my husband and I are trying to figure out what we can do for them, and we’ve come up with various suggestions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">We’d like them to come and visit us, for instance, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , but he has said it’s too far, his doctor would not let him fly that far. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">So then we came up with different suggestions, but we have not gotten together yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">I think eventually we will fly to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and invite them somewhere, or maybe meet again in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , something like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1219">QUESTION:  Do -- does this episode in any way change just some of your feelings about going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> again? </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">You say maybe another future trip?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1221">ANSWER:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">Yes, I feel much more relaxed about going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">By choice I would have never gone, but when we were fir -- invited to go there to speak to the students, I felt that that could be my contribution to history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">To do something, to let them know that this 1s not just a story, that this is indeed true, cause here I am, and you can speak to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And I told the students then, if it had not been for Hitler and the Nazi period, I would be one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">I would have lived here possibly for the rest of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">But because of destiny, it was different, and I had no control over that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1228">QUESTION:  Because, of course, your family felt very German, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1229">ANSWER:  Oh they -- my fa -- father said, nothing can happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">After all, I served in World War I. I was on the front, I was a -- a soldier, I fought for the <span class="REGION">Fatherland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">That couldn’t -- nothing could happen to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">But we all know that that’s not the way it was, but they felt very German, just like I feel Iam an American, and I’m sure that my children feel a hundred percent American, they were born here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">But our parents felt the same way about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">They did not feel different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">They had been in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for hundreds of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">And they felt that n -- they -- they were Germans, just like we are Americans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1237">QUESTION:  Now, I think there is one other item that was in your family’s possession, that there’s another, separate story about this item, because it was not returned by Horst, but it was still -- still somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">Can you tell me about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1239">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">Well, when I met Horst, I said to him, the only picture I actually remember from my childhood is a picture of Moses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">And to the best of my knowledge, the whole picture, in my mind, was done in Hebrew letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">Because I can remember standing in front of that picture, since I was always interested in art, saying how can somebody make a picture by using only letters? </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">So that’s what I remembered about the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">So he said, “Oh, you mean the Moses picture with the 10 commandments?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">I said, “That’s the only thing -- I wonder where that is, because if it’s only in Hebrew letters, there can’t be many of those around, it must be somewhere.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">So he said, “Oh, my sister had it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">She gave it to the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">And that’s the old <span class="BUILDING">Jewish museum</span> , not the [indecipherable], it’s called -- has another name, something or other [indecipherable] in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> it was behind the <span class="DLF">wall</span> when the <span class="DLF">wall</span> was still up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">So --
QUESTION:  Does it -- is it still there, or were those items taken to the new <span class="BUILDING">Jewish museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1251">ANSWER:  No, it was at the old j -- at the old <span class="BUILDING">synag</span> -- at the old <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the alt [indecipherable]
QUESTION:  The new <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1252">ANSWER:  Not the new one.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1253">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1254">ANSWER:  Not the new one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">It’s a combination of <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">If you want Ill look up the name of the mu -- <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> late -- of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">So, I contacted that particular <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and was in touch with Dr. Simon and told him that I am the sole survivor of my parents fa -- direct family, and I heard that the picture has been donated to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , or the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , and I would like them to know that I am here, and I would like to have the picture returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">He was very, very evasive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">Eventually I made an appointment with him to meet with him while we were on our trip to Europe last year when we met Horst. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">And I made a date to meet him at the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> with Jutta. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">And I spent a whole hour with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">I said, look, I have sent you my birth certificate, which is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> and you know that my parents are Ernst, Marguerita Cohn, and you know that the picture was given to you by Horst’s sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">And he never denied having the picture, but for almost a year we have been talking back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">And he told me then that the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> has never returned anything to anyone, because if they would return that picture, then other people would re -- want their belongings back, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">I didn't see it in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> because I think they had it in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> somewhere, it was not exhibited. </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">We tried very, very hard for him to give it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">Jutta would go over fr-from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> and collect it, and there were all kinds of legal things back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">Eventually our son from Florida contacted his senator, who contacted the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">And the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> contacted Dr. Simon and said, why are you not returning this to Lillyan Rosenberg? </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">She 1s an immediate heir of that painting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">Then he softened a little bit, he did not want to have problems with the American government, because now the government got involved. </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">And a little while ago, approximately four weeks ago, he said it -- a yo -- to the man at the <span class="BUILDING">American consulate</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> that all Jutta has to do is make an arrangement with him and come and pick it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">So Jutta has picked it up, it is now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> and will be on view at the little <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Moses Mendelssohn academy</span> for awhile, and then we will make arrangements to have it shipped to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1274">QUESTION:  So -- and tell me a little of the history. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">This is not something your mother created.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1276">ANSWER:  No, this -- no, this is not done by my mother, it’s just a picture that I remember from my parent’s <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">And the picture is not the picture the way I remembered it, but you know, I was a child and it’s many, many years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">But I do remember the Hebrew, and the 10 commandments. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">So I am not sure that this is the picture that I was describing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">But we decided my parents could have more than one picture which they have given away, and -- so we -- we d -- I don’t know for sure if that is the picture that I had in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">It is, however, Moses and the 10 commandments.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1282">QUESTION:  And obviously, it sounds like it’s -- it’s important to you that it be on exhibit in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1283">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And this way it gives some publicity to the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">And the little <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> is doing very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">It’s getting tourists from all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">And one of the things that the little <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> has been able to do -- for instance, when Jutta was here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> about four weeks ago, and she stayed with us, she told me that one of the professors from a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , her family is from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , she thought she was alone in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">Her back -- background, her family name was h -- Hirsch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">Because there was Hirsch Kupva and Hirsch something else in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">So when she got in touch with Jutta, Jutta told her, you know, you have a lot of members of your family in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , which she did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">So this woman by the name of Hirsch, here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , did not know that she had family in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">They all met again in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">So the little <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> there is getting people together from different parts of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">And this year they invited grandchildren, that would have been like our age grandchildren, to come there and write about genealogy of their family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">So they’re doing a lot of good things in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1296">QUESTION:  And so there were a number of survivors, maybe mostly children, but it sounds like there were survivors of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1297">ANSWER:  In different parts of the world, yes, and all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">I mean, they are just scattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">I believe the -- a family from the Rabbi Owerbach, that family is in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">But of course, I’ve lost contact with most people, but through a reunion in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Halberstadt</span> , or the kindertransport reunion, people do find each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1301">QUESTION:  Okay, and let me see if I have any other questions to ask? </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">Did you keep this baby doll that’s named after Horst?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1303">ANSWER:  No, unfortunately I only have the picture of the doll called Horst. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">And one of the newspapers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> put the title, a doll called Horst, and had two full pages on the story of the reunion with Horst and myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1305">QUESTION:  How does it feel, this media attention you’ve gotten here, and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , is it -- is it also a surprise, or -- or how has that been for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1306">ANSWER:  I look at that as though my life, which I didn’t think was so -- so unusual, because when I have a -- neighbors here, and they say, oh you have such an interesting life, and I’d say where were you from? </span><span class="sentence" id="1307"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">I’d say, I wish I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">I don’t want such an interesting life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">But now that it is the way it 1s, I would like it to be a contribution to history, so that no one will ever doubt what has happened to children like myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And on a positive vein, I would say that of all the people I know who have grown up under very difficult conditions and I s -- look at their family and their children, they have all done a very good job with their sons and daughters, and most of them are professionals and doing very, very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">So I believe we’ve been able to teach them very good values.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1313">QUESTION:  Do you -- for yourself, would you say that -- that is a direct result of the way that you had your own childhood and the hardships of your childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1314">ANSWER:  Yes, I believe so, even though I think children of kindertransport parents feel that they are overly protected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">That is a complaint we get from all the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">They will say my mother wants to know where I am, my father wants to know where I am, they’re always keeping tabs on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">That might be some of our insecurity of people like myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">But when I watch my children, who now have teenage children, they’re doing the same thing with theirs -- children, they’re bringing them up the same way, and I must say I’m glad about that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1319">QUESTION:  Do you find it difficult to reminisce and to remember all these details about -- about your childhood?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1320">ANSWER:  I would say yes, because it’s not a subject that I dwell upon at all, I look at the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">Although, we already pretty old, there prob -- I don’t know how much future there is, but we look at it in a positive way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">And the past seems to have its very emotional moments. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">I know that when we spoke about the time I was told to leave the <span class="BUILDING">Allen’s house</span> , how upsetting that was for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">I think that that was equally upsetting as leaving my <span class="BUILDING">parent’s home</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1325">QUESTION:  And has religion played a very important part in your life, in part because of -- of what you went through, would you say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1326">ANSWER:  I don -- I cannot really answer that with a yes or no ques -- statement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">I know that I feel absolutely Jewish, you could not change me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">But I think we’re also very tolerant of all other religions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">We have the two sons, one became very religious, and one married a girl who became Jewish, as I told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">So we brought them up in a modest way, not in a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> , but they learned about their background by going to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">They were Bar Mitzvahed, they had Jewish weddings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">They keep a different kind of <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the one in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> , Ralph and his wife, they have a <span class="BUILDING">kosher home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">Steven and Susan and Miranda have the average kind of <span class="BUILDING">home</span> like we have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">But we do keep all holidays and we try to get together as a family at least once a year and that is on Passover, so that we are at one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> with both sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">That was my request to both daughter-in-laws when they got married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1336">QUESTION:  Well, I want to thank you very much for agreeing to be interviewed, and just wanted to see if there was anything else you would like to contribute or share before we end the interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1337">ANSWER:  I think you have delved into my life quite deeply, and if I can be useful to others because of my past, then I will feel it’s my little contribution to this world, apart from having a wonderful husband and two great sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">We’ve made the best of every possible situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">And I thank you for the time you’ve spent with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1340">QUESTION:  Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">End of Tape Three, Side B Conclusion of Interview </span>
