<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  So, let's begin with you introducing yourself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  I'm Henry Cohen. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , 73 years ago, I'll be 74 in June, and I think I was born on <span class="DLF">Henry Street</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">lower Manhattan</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">lower East Side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And I don't know whether I was named after the <span class="DLF">street</span> or whether the <span class="DLF">street</span> was named after me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Tell us about your parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  My parents had a checkered career. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">They were both immigrants, they arrived from different communities in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> in approximately 1907. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My father was married at the time he arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And he and my mother met and they fell in love. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And eventually they were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">But a lot of sturm und drang! </span><span class="sentence" id="11">over many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And so I, I, I was born in 1922, I have an older brother, 1919, he's 75, yeah, 75 going on 76 and I have a younger sister who will be 68 and from my father's first liaison, I had an older half-sister and an older half-brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">QUESTION:  What do you know about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> — the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> where your parents came from and why did they want to come here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="14">ANSWER:  Well, my father was born to a baker, and was himself a baker at a very young age. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">His mother died when he was very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">I've written a piece on this, incidentally, called "A Century of Time." </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And his father remarried a woman who had two small children. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">My father, as a six or seven year old, recalled waking up to noise in the middle of the night and seeing, some feet away in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen area</span> , by candlelight, his stepmother feeding her children. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">He would recall as a youngster, in that age group, six, seven, eight, taking rolls and bread from his father's <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> in the winter and putting 1t under his coat and running to the edge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and trading with the Lithuanian farmers for milk and cheese. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So it was that kind of poverty. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">He turned against his father, I guess partly because of that, partly because of the growing spirit of enlightenment, enlightenment that was spreading in the 19th century. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And he became an anarchist, and by 15 or 16 he was living in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , owning a <span class="BUILDING">bakery</span> of his own, hiding inside the bakery arms of the anarchist movement — and may have played some role in the Russian Revolution of 1905. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">Anyway, to escape that life and that situation, and probably the Russian draft, he fled to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , leaving behind a wife and one or two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">My mother came from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , which, before she was born, had a population of about four or five thousand, but ' storm and stress (German); "life's hard knocks," hassles. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">there was apparently a big fire, which she had no memory of. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I picked this up at the Museum of the Diaspora in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">The population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> declined by half — 25, 3,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And she was a child of very old parents who had previous marriages. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So, at the time she was born, her mother was 50 and her father was 65. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And, thus, by the time she was 15, her mother was 65 and her father was 80, and that was a family of butchers. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And so, her mother and father decided to turn over their little <span class="BUILDING">butcher shop</span> to a, an older sister who was married to a butcher, and in return for <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for their stay, being taken care of in their old age. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And the son-in-law, husband of sis— my mother's older sister, said he could take care of the parents, but he couldn't take care of young Sadie, age 15. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">So she was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So, it's a story of great poverty, the background.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  Can you tell us both of their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  What?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Can you tell us both of their names?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  Yeah, my mother's name was Sadie Sheftel, I think it was Shayne Rochel Sheftel, was the family name. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And my father's name was Avram, Abe, and, I think, I can't quite sort out the grandparent's names. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Chana Leah was his mother briefly, until she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">His father's name was Israel Feivel. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">My mother’s father’s name was, I had it and I lost it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  You'll remember it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  And the names of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  My mother came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ivye</span> and my father came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drozgenik</span> which was a sort of a small <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Interestingly enough, I've not been able to find material on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Drozgenik</span> in the encyclopedia, the Jewish encyclopedia, which has Ivye. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And I, someone at the New York Public Library gave me some alternative names to try to trace through Lithuanian sources. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Because for some reason, the Jewish sources don't have it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  What did your parents do here? </span><span class="sentence" id="51">When you were little, how did they make a living?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">ANSWER:  Well, my father became a baker. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My mother became a dressmaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">They happened to meet in a small <span class="INT_SPACE">tenement apartment</span> on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lower East Side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">My father's older brother lived there with his wife who, it turned out, was a niece of my mother’s, but older than my mother because she had been born to some older half-brother and they had a little baby at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And to keep things going they had boarders. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So, there was a group of male boarders in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where my father stayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And my mother stayed with two or three female boarders in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And that's how they met and shacked up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  And they spoke Lithuanian to each other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">ANSWER:  No, they spoke Yiddish, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">They may have spoken Lithuanian, but I never heard it. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Yeah, it was Yiddish all the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And — but as a result of this upbringing, this parentage, we grew up in a <span class="BUILDING">secular household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I was not bar mitzvahed, my brother was not bar mitzvahed. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We had a very strong Jewish/Yiddish education through Workman's Circle schools. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And my brother even today prides himself that he doesn't read the English version of the Forward, he buys the Yiddish version of the Forward? </span><span class="sentence" id="68">and reads that. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And I went through the Workman's Circle elementary schools, <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and even into their sem-— the <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> for several years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Tell us what that is.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  Well, the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> was somewhere in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  No, I mean the Workman's Circle.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  Workman's Circle was a fraternal organization that was linked to the Jewish socialist movement, the Bund’. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And so, in, particularly at the <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> level, when I was going, I was taught by very prominent, famous Jewish literary people, scholars. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">It was in that sense a terrific education and I was taught all the Yiddish classic writers. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Mendele,* Peretz,’ Sholom Aleichem, Ash®, poets, but not taught Hebrew. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And it was an anti- Zionist education because the Socialists out of the 19th century were universalists. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Anti- stateism, stateists. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And I— when I went into the Army in 1944, I was trained for the infantry, went to Europe, fought in the infantry, the whole German campaign. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">After the war ended in Europe, I got myself transferred to military government and it was at that time in the summer of 1945, that I began hearing about the Holocaust and reading about ? </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Jewish Daily Forward > Algemeyner Yidish Arbeter Bund in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lita</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poylen</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Rusland</span> [Universal Jewish Worker’s Union in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> ] (Yiddish); Jewish socialist organization. * </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Mocher Seforim Mendele > Isaac Leib Peretz ° Sholem Ash it. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">And suddenly realizing that the political perspective that I had been taught in this Socialist system had really given me an empty political perspective for what was needed after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And so I sat down as a young person of 23, and I wrote a letter to one of the senior people at the Workman's Circle complaining about it, and protesting against it, and declaring that I would never set foot into Workman's Circle activity again. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Because I felt I had been misguided, politically. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And just as a minor passing note, by pure coincidence, in the last month or so, the Forward had a controversy going between the old Socialists and some references in the Forward to Jabotinsky’, who was a right wing Zionist, the Socialists regarded him as a Fascist, so you get these articles and letters to the editor carrying on this old struggle with Jabotinsky. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">So, I decided to sit down and write a letter to the Forward telling the story that I've just told you. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And referring, by saying that the problem isn't the Socialist and Jabotinsky, the problem centers on the anti, the Socialist anti-Zionist poison in general, against Ben Gurion® and Labor and Mapai’ and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So they printed it as the lead letter and the headline was "Socialist Anti-Zionism — Zionist Poison." </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So, I'm waiting for the responses to come in from the Socialists now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">QUESTION:  What, in what way had they misguided you? </span><span class="sentence" id="92">What did you start learning about or realizing after the war that you felt you had been misguided on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  They had trained, they had trained the Jewish side of me, the Yiddish side of me and then not provided me with a coherent political platform for that cultural education. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">They were anti-stateist. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">They used to write diatribes against Theodor Herzl'° and Weizman!! </span><span class="sentence" id="96">and that group also. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So, here we were in Europe immediately after the end of the war where it was clear that the survivors would have to go to a state and the only ones who were organizing to take them in were the Zionists from <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">They were the ones who were organizing the <span class="DLF">underground routes</span> to bring them to <span class="DLF">European ports</span> and transferring them to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ships</span> and sneaking them into <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was not open, the anti— there were no anti— there were no refugee immigration laws at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So, in that sense, the other thing I point out in my letter is that is a result of coming to grips with this six months later, after I went into <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , I could greet the Chief Rabbi of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> with a feeling of love and no mixed feelings, even though I'm not a religious person. ’ </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Vladimir Jabotinsky ® David Ben Gurion ? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Mifleget Po'alei Eretz Israel; Israeli labor party founded 193 0. '</span><span class="sentence" id="103">0 Theodor Herzl 'l Chaim Weizman I could go into a mass meeting of 2,000 people and hear Ben Gurion and be exhilarated. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I could deal with a Hasidic rabbi who was in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> on a fellowship basis and what this opened up to me, finally, by virtue of my rebellion against the Socialists, was my all inclusive Jewish quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Just a little bit back because I think we need a few details about your time in the military. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">How did you go into it? </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Where did you go at first? </span><span class="sentence" id="108">What did you see and how did that affect you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">There was period after I got my baccalaureate, well actually, I moved very quickly from my baccalaureate into my masters program of city planning, so I got a deferment or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But a friend of mine and I were exploring because we knew eventually we'd have to go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And I remember us going to a <span class="BUILDING">naval recruiting station</span> , oh like 1943, let's say. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And the fellow across the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> is saying to us, "Do you like a good fight?" </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And we're; "uh, huh, uh," and, and then he's talking that they need people for LST, for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">landing ship tanks</span> , you know, to run the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And we leave the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and one of us says to the other, "You know, I prefer terra firma, the firmer the better." </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So, independently of one another we were eventually mustered, not mustered, but taken in and within a month of my getting my master's degree, I was in the Army and in training and then six months later I was in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">I arrived at the <span class="DLF">beaches</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">What?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  The year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  1944, then, September. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And within weeks, transferred to, I was a replacement, transferred to the ninth Division at the Belgian boarder — <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hurtgen Forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And overnight the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hiirtgen Forest</span> had some very special qualities; 1t was a tall <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and what the Germans were doing was shelling and the shells would hit the tops of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and detonate and the shrapnel would come down on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And one-third of the group that I came in, either left in one day, dead or wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So, that was my initiation into combat. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But in any event, I guess it was probably by October began the onslaught against <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And I was with the ninth Infantry Division. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Which it turned out, the irony is, that they were the occupying division of the <span class="REGION">area</span> in which the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> I went later, was in. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">My battalion, my regiment, were my primary adversaries. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And life is very peculiar and funny in some ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Anyway, so I was in battle for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> which 1s closest to the <span class="DLF">French border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ruhr River</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Duren</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I was in the Battle of the Bulge. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">We then moved into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Rhine</span> when that was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bad Godesburg</span> which is just south of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bonn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Home to many governmental, <span class="BUILDING">German governmental offices</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And one night, at four in the morning, five in the morning, word comes through that we've, the American forces have captured the <span class="DLF">Remagen bridge</span> and they have sent people over it and we are put onto <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , and by 11 o'clock in the morning we're down at the site and we're crossing the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> under direct fire from the other <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Like the <span class="DLF">Palisades</span> in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , crossing George Washington, under direct fire, you could see the tracer bullets as you're running your way across the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And we establish a beach head on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Now, just to step back a bit, because I've since been back there and also a friend of mine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , was in the public relations unit of the division that took the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> originally. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And it's an interesting story about the difference between the American forces and the German forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">By that point in the war, Hitler was trying to run the war, removing decision making from his commanders. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">In our case, what happened, was that a scouting group from one of the American divisions, moving through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , bypassing the city of Remagen, came to the <span class="DLF">heights</span> there above the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , they look out and they see the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> 1s still standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">It was the only <span class="DLF">bridge</span> still standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And they get word back to the battalion commanders, to the regimental commanders, to the division commanders, and to the Army group and then to General Bradley!” , </span><span class="sentence" id="145">General Bradley reaches Eisenhower at dinner that evening and says to him, "Shall — which battle plan — shall I stay with the battle plan that we're on, or shall I start changing things, because of this discovery of the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> standing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And Ike says, "Forget the old battle plan, pour the troops across." </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Now, that was the flexibility in decision making by able people. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And so, Bradley starts giving the signal, "Pour it on, get” — he mobilizes all the different divisions under him, "let's pour it on." </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And that shortened the war by two or three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And so — and I've since, incidentally, read historical criticism of the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest — basically, as an infantry private, I adored my commanders. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I adored Bradley. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I adored Eisenhower. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I thought they were the greatest in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And, and anyway, I fought all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">We could have moved on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">But, as a result of the Yalta agreement, we didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And I, I feel great about having been a soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I feel lucky that I survived it, that I was never wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">It's all luck, there's nothing else but luck that makes a difference between wounded, dead and a standing soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I been, you know, battle after battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I should, also, as an interlude here, indicate that there came a time in early April when we're moving towards the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Ruhr Valley</span> , that I got a pass, a three day pass to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">That was part of the rotation scheme. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Letting different soldiers take a few days from the <span class="DLF">front line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> in April of 1945, a month as it turned out, before the war ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And I'm walking — I'm choking up as I'm telling you this story — I'm walking along the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Champs-Elysées</span> , and word spread that Roosevelt had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Again, you know, I believe all the things that the Holocaust people are saying about Roosevelt's inaction about the Holocaust, but, nevertheless, he was my Commander in Chief, and a soldier needs confidence that he's being well led,

id="168">Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Anyway, then because of my '2 Gen. Omar Nelson Bradley prior education and settlement house experience, I succeeded in getting myself transferred to military government. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">There I was promoted to Technician Fifth Grade. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And I had terrific relationships with the military government, I don't know who. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We were in, in a <span class="REGION">county</span> , incidentally, Landkreis’’, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ginzburg</span> , which was between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ulm</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsberg</span> , and it happened to be the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , I didn’t notice at the, time, from which the Mengele family'* comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I didn't know this. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And as part of my duties for a few months, I set up a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for German women who were presumed to have venereal disease. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And it was in response to the American soldiers who were, came down with venereal disease and they'd have to give the doctors the probable source of their particular encounter. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And you'd get a name, and I was the chosen one. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">I set up the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and then I would drive to the particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> and try to identify the woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">I might meet with the local mayor or police chief or whoever, "Who's Daisy around here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And I'd bring her in. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And all the way she would complain, she's “eine anstandige Frau,'>” she's a respectable woman, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And then I'd bring them in, go on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We had a group of nuns taking care of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">They were tested. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Then by three days later they weren’t giving me any argument that they were respectable women. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And, I remember once, a woman, who we finally discharged, came into the colonel or the chief of the group, wanting a letter that she was a her husband was coming back from the Luftwaffe'®, she wanted some letter attesting to her this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And the major, colonel, calls me in and tells me about it and I says, "Look, all you can do is give her a letter." </span><span class="sentence" id="187">End of Tape #1 '3 District (German) 4 Family of Josef Mengele 'S a decent woman (German) '6 air force (German) Tape #2
QUESTION:  Just finish that last story about the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> with the German woman, the one, what your supervisor said about the letter.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Incidentally, I noticed in my material here that I, I had a memo in my material that I've just looked at, I haven't even read it word for word. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Which is my inspecting a — some <span class="BUILDING">hospital facility</span> somewhere in this <span class="REGION">county</span> we were in, which was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for Jewish displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I have absolutely no recall about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">If you had asked me had you had any prior contact with Jewish DP’s, I would have said "no." </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Because I've been asked that question before, but it appears, so I have like a five or six page memo of an inspection of this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And I've just done an essay for class about an inspection I made of <span class="BUILDING">Harlem hospital</span> in 1961. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">It's a subliminal yearning I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Anyway, so, anyway, that county experience was a very interesting experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And, but then, I had earlier somehow, since when I was trying to transfer to military government, I put in at a number of <span class="NPIP">places</span> , so I was called to serve at <span class="BUILDING">Supreme Headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> military government. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">They had higher authority in the contact, so they overruled my local commander and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and there, because of my combination of German and Yiddish — two years of German in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and Yiddish — I was used as a translator of German documents into English. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And then that must have lasted a month or so and I suddenly was told to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wetzlar</span> north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> to supervise the military government printing plant. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">That was printing military government documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">It was an old German printing force and I was there overseeing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And in any event, during the, let's say, May or June period to October, I discovered probably some exchanges of correspondence that the head worker, the executive director of the <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> that I had lived in for a year and a half while going to <span class="BUILDING">graduate school</span> , was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and with UNRRA and he was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So, occasionally, once a month, I don't remember, on a weekend, I would travel from where I was to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , which wasn't far, and I'd spend a day with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And then, in November, I learned that he was leaving <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for, the States. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">He was going into the State Department Office of Refugee Affairs and so, we rendezvoused in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wiesbaden</span> one weekend, which was zone headquarters for <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , and it was over that weekend, and his name 1s Dick Winslow, Richard Winslow. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">He later, a year later, two years later, became the Secretary General to the Unite States Mission to the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> , right after it was formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">A very able fellow. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Anyway, over this weekend, he said, "What the hell is someone like you doing supervising the operation of a <span class="BUILDING">printing plant</span> , when there would be so much more important things for you to be doing given your background and your interests?" </span><span class="sentence" id="209">You see, at the <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">my, one of my major assignments during the year and a half I was there, you had to do something in exchange for <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board, it was the <span class="BUILDING">South End House</span> , was the second oldest <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">It had been founded in 19 —1892 or 1893. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">He had to prepare a 50th annual report. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">He turned that assignment over to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I went into all the historical files and books and reports and this and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I did the draft of the 50th annual report. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">This is how he and I became so close. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Then he did some revision and upgrading and this and that, and it was printed. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And then I did other things in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">settlement house community</span> , I did a term paper for my master's program on city planning, on the South End planning board. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">A history of that and what it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">So, he had a pretty good sense of my intellectual and practical interests of experience and then the following morning he brought me into <span class="BUILDING">zone headquarters</span> and Gertrude Richland(ph) was there from the <span class="REGION">Eastern Division</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">A marvelous woman, she just died about two years ago in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santa Barbara</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">She later became Chief Public Welfare Officer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, D.C.</span> And they recruited me, signed me up, and they had in mind for me to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fohrenwald</span> because the then director was a Canadian woman, a fine woman in many ways, but having inordinate difficulties with the Jewish DP’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">She seemed to be somewhat rigid and the plan was for me to come in, serve for several weeks as her deputy, and then two weeks later she would be transferred out and I would become the director. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Anyway, then—
QUESTION:  Just before we get into that, I would like to just move back and get a sense of what was your feeling, when you were in the infantry, about the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="225">What did you think you were fighting against, your contact with Germans? </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And then as the information came out about the Holocaust, did you have any contact with it in anyway?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  Well, I guess I completely identified with the war effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  I mean, you can tell from the way I spoke a few minutes ago about Roosevelt, that I had absolutely no question in my mind or emotions about the purposes of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I had, I — because of my German Yiddish, even in doing combat periods, I was always being used as an interpreter whenever we'd capture German prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">So, I had a lot of contact with German prisoners of war, army, whatever branch they were from. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">I had a lot of contact with the German civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I didn’t trust Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Didn't matter what they said to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I was always doing my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">In some ways, I have a one track mind and in the sense of being focused. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And — then when we ended the war in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> , I don't remember what date we arrived there, April 29th, 28th — May first — a week or two — week before the end of the war, they started — the commander started sending us across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> which is at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipzig</span> to a little <span class="DLF">peninsula</span> there that's formed by another <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and we were casing the joint before the Russians arrived and after a few days, there were tens of thousands of German troops running away from the Russians to the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">And we're just a few soldiers, and they're armed and we've got one rifle on our shoulder. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">We were marching thousands of German soldiers westward across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">And I don't even remember how we got across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And so, I had a lot of contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And down in the military government and in the county, I had a lot of contact with Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Remember, I was having contacts with the Biirgermeisters'’ and the chiefs of police and the health officials and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">But, in a certain sense, I was the conqueror, I had the power. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And it's interesting to me, Katie!</span><span class="sentence" id="246">®, and I don't understand it considering my background, but you've seen some of the pictures. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I was, here I was a private and a corporal, but in the pictures that I have of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">UNRRA</span> , you see the qualities with which I express, I visually express authority. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So, you know, speaking to the DP’s, you can see, I don't know where it comes from. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And, SO, In my relations with the Germans and so on and so forth, matter of factly, I'm never hemming or hawing, or beating the bush, I'm always going about doing my business and I'm, I, not making any judgments about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">This individual, that individual. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">A woman has venereal disease, we deal with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">I was not with any group that was opening <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , I was not with any group that was dealing with the SS or with the political dimension in terms of the war crimes trials that would later occur. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I was not in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Somehow or other in ways that I have absolutely no memory of, whether it's Stars and Stripes, whether American Armed Forces Radio, I learned about the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I don't think anybody was sending me the New York Times or the Paris edition of the Herald Tribune, but somehow I was in gathering. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And it was obvious from what I did with regard to the Workman's Circle, that it was, it was working on my system. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And that I had strong feelings about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Oh, powerful feelings about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And when one thinks later about my last encounter in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> with Dick Winslow and a colleague who was leaving at the same time, Roger Masteude, they were telling me to come in, I didn't jump at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I asked a lot of questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">It was a gradual, two day, weekend process. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">I was doing a lot of soul searching, incidentally.. Now that I think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Doing a lot of soul searching that weekend on other matters. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">I was soul searching about what I felt was the inanity and the corruption of many of the American soldiers I was running into. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">I — at —I mean, remember, I was an educated young kid, a City College!’ </span><span class="sentence" id="266">graduate and proud of that, MIT” graduate and proud of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And I was dealing with very — I was a private, I wasn't an officer — and dealing with these people in various situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And that was not what was giving me my love for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">When I was running the <span class="BUILDING">printing plant</span> I lived with some local group of soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I was '7 mayors (German) '8 Katherine Davis '9 City College of New York 0 Massachusetts Institute of Technology not, I was attached to them for <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">My unit was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and I could see some of these guys were wheelers, dealers, <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We were eating venison — where were they getting the fresh deer from? </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So, here were very close friends, spirits, over that weekend with Dick and Roger Masteude. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And I was just getting out all the pain of that experience to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">And I guess it was partly that accumulated pain as well as my Jewish identity that finally enabled them to convince me to do this, and for me to say okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  Elaborate a little bit on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">You say your Jewish identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Do you remember how that came into play? </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Or anything you thought?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  Oh, well it's hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">It's my second nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">You know it's — people can't understand this about me, because of my secularism and my lack of the bar mitzvah. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I never touched foot in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , literally, until maybe 10 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">It was just not part of my background. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Now, I do different things that bring me into that, even though I can’t believe what they're talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">For me, it's history, not religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And I can identify with the history, I can extract philosophical meaning from it and, belief. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And be proud of that and share the pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">No, I think that this small group of people has made an enormous, an inordinate contribution to the world and to world civilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">For a variety of reasons and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">You know, when I was a junior at <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , sociology major, I was declared, whatever, an honor student. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">An honor student was relieved of having to take certain courses for credit. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">But, in exchange, the honor student had to do a paper, a two year project. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And submit it and that would complete the terms of the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And I did a paper on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish ghetto</span> as a form of either adaptation or a form of accommodation to the urban environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Remember, I was an urbanist. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And I spent a good deal of those two years in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> studying Jewish history. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Going back almost 2,000 years in terms of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> and other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And up to Louie Wirth's book on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he 1s professor of sociology at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I— in 1940, 1940, '41, I was studying the various ethnicity data and the incidents of different social economic indicators and medical indicators of Jews compared to other immigrant groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I immersed myself in that material. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">It was really in a sense, that piece of work that led me into city planning not vice versa. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">It was this feeling that if this history and this culture could lead to certain cultural qualities and changes, that made them so much better adapted to the urban environment than other groups, then maybe there's a volitional way in which you could do things in general that would improve the urban environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And that's when I set in, I didn't know there were masters degrees in city planning at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I hardly, barely knew that there was a city planning commission in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I began putting it together in my own head. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I went out, I found that the <span class="BUILDING">University of Iowa</span> was virtually the only <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that had two summer sessions back to back. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So, I applied and I went out to <span class="REGION">Iowa</span> and I started taking courses in what I thought were — one would want me to know in order to put these things together. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I took a course in surveying. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I took a course in civil engineering. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">I took courses in calculus. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I took courses in spherical trigonometry. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">In order, back then, sometime in early August, I'm in the <span class="BUILDING">library</span> and I'm looking at the Sunday New York Times and somewhere I come across a little squib that, which indicates that Mass — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">MIT</span> is going to start offering a bachelors degree in city planning. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So, I write the chairman of the program a letter saying, "I already have a baccalaureate degree, but I would like to enter this program if you would give me certain credit for my past baccalaureate," and I get a letter back from him saying oh, they already have a masters program. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">I wouldn't have to take the baccalaureate, he would, with my background, he would admit me to the masters program. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And he was then the one, he gave me a scholarship, and he was then the one who guided me to the <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> for, so I could live cheaply. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">My parents or I, we'd survive with food on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> during the depression, but that's how I got to the <span class="BUILDING">settlement house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And little did I know when this was happening that the chairman of the program, Fred Adams, was the son of the chief city planner who had, British city planner, who had done the major New York regional plan of 1929, 1930. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And, so it was, again, it was in that Jewish context, I mean, that stuff surrounds you and penetrates you. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">I didn't have to go to <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> ’! </span><span class="sentence" id="321">or <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> —
QUESTION:  Do you remember when you decided to take the job what you're thoughts were? </span><span class="sentence" id="322">Perhaps some of this was in your mind about, "I do know these things, maybe I could run a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> because I know about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and—"

Wagner Jr. was exhausting period for me, I came back to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> one day to take care of some matters, and a few minutes later, my English secretary, Rose Hafkin, comes in, she says, "Henry, there's a woman <span class="NPIP">outside</span> who says she thinks she's your cousin." </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And I say, "Well, have her wait few minutes, I've got to take care of this or that," and then a few minutes later I call her in. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And now I'm suspicious, I don't know if she's my cousin or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">It would be advantageous to her if she is my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">So, I start interrogating her. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Anyway, I don't know whether she found out about me through the grapevine, because people are always asking, "Where did your parents come from?" </span><span class="sentence" id="526">and then when they hear someone comes from that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , well, "Oh, the director at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Fohrenwald</span> , his mother comes from there, his father comes from there." </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Well, whether there had been some correspondence between her and family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">She's my cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">And, she comes from the Sheftel branch of the family tree, my mother’s, the butcher side of the family, not the baker side. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">It turns out she has a brother in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to whom she doesn't talk, he's a butcher. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">He's probably one of my black marketers. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I don't know at the time whether he's the one who made the threat. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">It's a small world. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">But, anyway, she has a sister in this camp that both of them are living in, just north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and the sister has a young daughter, I don't know, seven, eight, nine, 10. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And, I ask her, "How did you survive?" </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Well, what happened was, the Germans had occupied the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Ivye</span> , and at a certain point they told — word spread, everybody had to come out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> square with their pots and pans, the Germans needed the metal. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">My cousin, this cousin, didn't wait for that, she escaped into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and lived the rest of the war with the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And her older sister must have left sometime earlier and gone into <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> with her little girl and spent the war in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And, so it was a very moving experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">And, she has since, they migrated many years ago to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> , and became very wealthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Now, another thing involving the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , the so called <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> —
QUESTION:  The people who went to the <span class="DLF">town square</span> , were they deported?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="542">ANSWER:  No, they were shot, I'm sorry, they were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">I'm very sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">Very few survivors from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ivye</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="545">QUESTION:  Your mother’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="547">QUESTION:  And the, how about the brother that she didn't speak with? </span><span class="sentence" id="548">How had he survived?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="549">ANSWER:  I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">There was other family of theirs in <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Rhodesia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Other brothers.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="552">QUESTION:  So, here you were, the director of the Displaced Person's camp, you’re dealing with everything, fought in a war, you have family here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="553">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">At the end of the interview, I'll give you another find.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">QUESTION:  Okay
ANSWER:  That's not in any of the material that you've read. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">End of tape #3 Tape #4
ANSWER:  Well, her name was Malka and the second names mean nothing because — her sister had an assumed name, Bashke — they were both Sheftels. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">Now, Malka, somewhere in this process, maybe in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> or in battle with the partisans or whatever, lost the love of her life at the time, Bashke obviously, lost her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">And — but, but it's hard to recall now. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Malka was probably born after my mother left, and Bashke was probably born after my mother left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ivye</span> , so there was no contact on that score. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">By the time they would have had any consciousness in terms, by virtue of age, they would probably not even have had any memory about my mother’s mother, no longer lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ivye</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="561">She went, they took her to some <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">So, there was a little talk about the family, but I don't really remember much of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">That 1s — the critical thing was, they were family, they were survivors, they had been through <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , and I didn't really find out too much about their day to day lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I have the impression about the older sister in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">She'd be groveling in the soil, planting, picking, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">I guess that in those days, I, I, well, let me put it this way, what I realize now in my dotage, is that for every one who died and for every one who survived, there would really be 10 or 20 stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">So, in a certain sense there are 100 to 200,000,00 stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">And we know only a few of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And that was not an age for me when I was collecting stories and, and, in a way, it, it, it — the — it — my focus on what I'm about, puts a limit on certain of the human connections from time to time. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">When people want to be able to tell you and so on, and you're focused and you're doing one, two, three on the list, see? </span><span class="sentence" id="571">So, I don't really remember that much about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">In any event, the passage of time also dims recall.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="573">QUESTION:  Was there ever a time when you were focused on solving a problem, perhaps a broken water pipe or something, and just somehow the fact that someone was a survivor, sort of caught you by surprise? </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Perhaps something they said, or the way they looked, facial expressions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  You know — the — a couple of stories sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">I don't know if you have that picture in your group. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">There are four little girls, they're all dressed in costumes. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">It's clear they've just been in some performance. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">And two of the four girls, the two little ones on the, each <span class="NPIP">side</span> , left and right, have faces that are so gaunt and with that smile on their face, the visage. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">The two older ones are smiling. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">The two little ones, here it is, you know, close to a year after the war, and the quietness wherever they were that was droned into them, hasn't yet enabled them to blossom out. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">The other, I don’t know whether this answers — deals with your question, Katie, but, again, it's an encounter, a very severe encounter. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">We had, in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a Rabbi Halberstam”°. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">He was called the Klausenburg Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">He was a, from a <span class="DLF">line</span> of hundreds of years of rabbis, and he was born to be a rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">I'm gonna, I'll come back to this in a minute, but I want to skip to the last week or two. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I've been trying to find out his first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I actually had it somewhere on a piece of paper and I can't locate the piece of paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So, I, I decided I would go to the Brooklyn telephone book and look up Halberstam and make a few phone calls and ask about the Klausenburg Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And what was his first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="592">So I go to the Brooklyn phone book, I have a 1992 Brooklyn phone book, it doesn't matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And I see Halberstam, it's almost a column long. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">And what I see in this listing of Halberstams is how many have attached to their name, "Rabbi." </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So, you know, with my statistical bent, I do a count. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Forty-three percent of the telephone listings are people with the word rabbi in front of their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">That's the Halberstam lineage, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I use statistics to illuminate, not lie. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">I mean that is such a powerful fact, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So, anyway, we're back. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">So, now, he had lost his wife in the Holocaust, and maybe 10 children. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">This man had suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Deeply is not an expression for the suffering that must have been inside this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And he was in touch with his confreres in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and they raised money. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And they piled all these supplies, canned food, dried food, kosher food, clothing, religious articles, books on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that came, arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And the Army would not release the material to Rabbi Halberstam. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And the cables must have flown between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and political pressure brought on Congress people, on the State Department, on the Army and finally after a week or two, a compromise is reached. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">They will release his — that material to the director of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="610">So, I am once again confronted with those daily dilemmas, what do I do with that material? </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Can I — considering the pressure I am under from the Army on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , simply transfer it over to Rabbi Halberstam? </span><span class="sentence" id="612">So, I am summoned to his <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="613">He was one of the very few people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> who had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> of his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Somewhere I have it, well, I won't bother, but probably 10 by 10 would have been a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">And I'm sitting across him, across the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> from him, and he's in a Hasidic robe, big black beard, yarmulke hat, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Black piercing eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And, remember what I told you earlier, I have never set foot in a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in my life to that point — nor for two or three decades later — and here I am confronting the Klausenburg Rabbi, a king — I'm an ordinary administrative bureaucrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And we exchanged perfunctory greetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And then in effect he says, "Nu?" </span><span class="sentence" id="620">I say, "Nu, what?" </span><span class="sentence" id="621">He wants to know why I don't turn the material over to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">I say, "But Rabbi, if the Army had intended for me to turn it over to you, they would have given it to you directly. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">But they turned it over to me which means that I can't turn it over to you." </span><span class="sentence" id="624">He *6 Jekuthieh Judah Halberstam says, "That's not fair." </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I hadn't yet learned the John Kennedy phrase which didn't come for 15 years later, "life is unfair." </span><span class="sentence" id="626">I said, "I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">It would create so much trouble, I can't tell you." </span><span class="sentence" id="628">He says, "It belongs to me." </span><span class="sentence" id="629">I say, "I know it belongs to you, but I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I will distribute it among the people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="631">You will get a good share of it, but you will not get all of it." </span><span class="sentence" id="632">He is so upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">His eyes are piercing through me. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">I finally say to him, "But, Rabbi, the other people are Jews too, they have also suffered." </span><span class="sentence" id="635">He basically, didn't give a damn. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I teamed something from that, I'd not encountered that before. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Here I am, an all inclusive Jew, what I hadn't quite recognized were the meaning of these divisions with unbridgeable attitudes or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">The meeting broke up and I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And I knew it wasn't fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">I knew, to this day, I know it wasn't fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">The Army shouldn't have done what it did, put me in that position. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">But, again, I had to make a decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">I had to choose. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">And, and, I made that choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">I mean, I don't recall that subsequently there were any further ramifications from it, but 1t was that incident, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">Now, let me just say, not only was the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> , this problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">You've heard -You've about it, you hear me about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">But, the Army was also greatly preoccupied with the infiltration problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">The British clearly didn't want more Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And I have, I haven't gone into that here, but I've been to the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span> and for selected weeks here and there over the last, during the last five years, maybe in the aggregate I've spent a month or five weeks of time at the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span> , trying to get some better understanding of the context. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And, incidentally, you find some very interesting material there on that. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I mean, for example, you come across cables, in late '45, the State Department is cabling all the ambassadors in every <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the world, asking on a top secret basis, "Is there any <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in your — in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> you are designated to, is there any <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for Jews?" </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And then you see cables coming back — I don't think I've read all the cables coming back — but substantially, the answer is "no." </span><span class="sentence" id="655">But, what you get in that period is the sense that Harry Truman and the State Department, under pressure from the British with regard to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , want to explore what are the options? </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Then in other material, you find the secret memoranda flowing out of the <span class="REGION">Eastern countries</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , relating to the Zionist plot to move people into the U.S. zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">And. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">some rabbi whose been to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , meets with the American Ambassador in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stockholm</span> and he's telling him about what he found. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">Anyway, you come across all this stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And some of it is suggestive of a conspiracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I've been exploring this in order to understand what I was in the middle of, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Finally, I don't remember the date now, there's a long memorandum, there are two I think, memorandum from Robert Murphy, whose the chief political officer at the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> of military government, he was Ike's*’ chief 7 Dwight D. Eisenhower political officer in <span class="COUNTRY">Tunisia</span> , <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> , and he's basically saying, "You're not dealing basically with a conspiracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">You're dealing — what you’re dealing with is the fact that the Jews don't want to live in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that was a <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> to their people, their relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">They are fearful of the Poles because when they go back to claim property, there are killings. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">They know that the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is going Communist, they don't want to live under a Communist government. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">It's in this atmosphere — to get out of this that the Zionists are enabling. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">It's not a conspiracy, okay?" </span><span class="sentence" id="668">So, that's at the highest level of military government. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">You come in at the field level, the second most important issue for this for the battalion leaders, is the infiltration. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">So, they start passing rules that we can't give out food cards to people who haven't had prior food cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">We can't give out identity cards to people who haven't had prior identity cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">How do you think we feel if, 1f in a team, you all have to be Jewish if you're in this team, you're there for social humanitarian purposes. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">How do you feel being told you can't give out these cards to people who are infiltrating? </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Now, I should point out—
QUESTION:  How do you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">ANSWER:  You feel awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And rebellious. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And you're gonna bootleg cards somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And, and, I should tell you this anecdote. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Nevertheless, under all of this pressure, twice a month, at midnight, you can ask — start asking, "When did I get some sleep?" </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I would go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , pick up a few cops, maybe this time I've had a staff or two with me, and we would start going into every <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and every <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and taking a count of who is there — name, and who is there. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">We were doing a midnight check and let's say, we found 2,500 people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="683">The next morning, word would spread that there was a midnight check. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">A thousand or more people from all over <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> would suddenly descend on you. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> to see a relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">They were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> to check on their papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">They were here because of that, they were — you don't know which of them are telling the truth and who, and who 1s lying. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">So, some end up with duplicate cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="690">You're making difficult decisions, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">QUESTION:  So, you're trying to control who's in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , but what you're saying said, people are coming in, maybe eight months after the war has ended, and the U.S. Army doesn't want them to, or <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> doesn't want them to—
ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I'm making two — I'm really talking about two categories. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I'm talking about the people who are already in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and who are, who are exploiting the system by getting duplicate cards so they can pick up the food here and there and move it on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and get a little cash. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And the other is the fresh arrivals. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And the Army is against the fresh arrivals. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">They don't like the duplicate cards, either, but they don't want any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Because no matter what Robert Murphy at the top level says — remember the top leadership is smarter, they're more politically connected to what's going on in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , so they — their attitude to Eisenhower and McCloy and so it's different at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Well, let me just state something else, Katie. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">You're too young — You have to understand that in the 1930s — I didn’t experience the 1920s, I was a child — but in 1930s and '40s there was a lot of antisemitism in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">A lot of ordinary citizens had anti-Jewish feelings. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">They're your troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">It's reflected — if you ask doctors who are, let's say, 75 years old and over, "What was it like getting into <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> in the 1930s?" </span><span class="sentence" id="705">You'll hear stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">My brother — I spoke to a fellow up on the vineyard who's a professor emeritus of physiology at <span class="BUILDING">Johns Hopkins</span> , he graduated as an undergraduate in the '30s, first in his class at <span class="BUILDING">Johns Hopkins</span> , was not admitted to the <span class="BUILDING">medical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">Went to the University of Maryland medical school and then sometime in the '50s, I guess, became the first Jewish professor at Johns — of medicine at <span class="BUILDING">Johns Hopkins</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="708">There was antisemitism, this is the — people don't speak about it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">I mean, it wasn't violent, it wasn't virulent like in Europe and certain various <span class="NPIP">places</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , certainly <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="710">But, there was lots. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So when you — when, at the ground floor level they, the infiltration, the infiltrees, are an inconvenience. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">It upsets the system. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">They want discipline — order, that's all an occupation force understands. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">I, I, I, I came across a letter someone in 1948 was asking me would I be willing to lecture at some military training program in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> as part of an effort to enrich an understanding of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">So, you come into here, and it's, it's, it's tailor made for a clash. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="717">It—
QUESTION:  What did you want though? </span><span class="sentence" id="718">As you're running the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> but you're also, you're Jewish, and as you said, you understand that these fresh arrivals could be fleeing persecution in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> like <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">So, what do you want?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">ANSWER:  Well, I want more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I mean it's no, no big deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Let me, I want to address this. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , at approximately the time I was there, there were a few, there were between 90 and 100,000 displaced persons, Jewish displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Of these, about 65,000 lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and 25,000 lived outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">In June of '46, which is towards the end of my stay, with the Army now for months ranting and raving about the infiltrees, don't give any — incidentally, I wasn't the only camp director or staff protesting these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">The, the UNRRA people in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> were also, we used to get together and organize group protests against some of this — but, in the middle of June, there's a pogrom in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kielce</span> — 40 Jews are killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I think in the next year, after I left, another 100,000 came. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">These are meaningless figures when you talking, when you're talking 6,000,000 dead, and 100,000 in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Equivalent to one and a half percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And if you have another 100,000, it's two-thirds of one percent, I think, if I'm doing the, no, it's two, two over 60, yeah, it's, no, it's two and a half percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I mean — the proportion between what's happened here and the number of survivors, the ratios, makes the — you should want more survivors rather than less. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And the political system worldwide has to adjust to that reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And here we are, a year after the end of the war, and these people are still homeless, without fresh food, I have in one of my memos an indication of some officer in some group situation, in a <span class="BUILDING">court</span> or something, suddenly arrests a Jew who's there. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And he later says he wanted to show the Germans that he was disciplining someone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  We need to change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">End of Tape #4 Tape #5
ANSWER:  Okay, I can't find that particular, maybe on the next break, I'll, I'll find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="739">QUESTION:  What we were just talking about, obviously, there's frustration in your voice about the situation and I did read some other journalistic reports commenting that people a year after the end of the war, a year after liberation, that people were living in very cramped <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> , that had echoes of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> — obviously they were worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Could you just talk a little more about that frustration. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">What would you have liked to have seen happening that you could not provide?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">ANSWER:  Well, you see, given the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself, which did not have individual <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> — though gradually, people got cookers and things like that — I would have wanted them to move into the <span class="BUILDING">German market</span> and get fresh food a year after the end, the war’s ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">What are we getting GI issue for? </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I would have preferred that they keep looking for more housing facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">So, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , in the large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , which could be the equivalent of about 350 square feet, which is smaller than 20 by 20, we could have as many as 15 to 20 people living. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Four or five families in double-decker <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cots</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="747">Families separating themselves from other families by hanging blankets from the ceiling — including some single individuals living in the middle of family — and people, and so on, and children and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">They should have gotten more <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Reduced the population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to, to 2,000 from 4,000, let's say. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And the food was a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">But they, basically, sometimes in a memo here and there you'll see, there are understandable humanitarian reasons, but then they go on to forget that they uttered that word. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">And it's a completely, it was a completely different outlook. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">You see, you also have to remember, Katie, that the GI’s were fraternizing with German girls and German women — widespread, extensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">The German types were more gemiitlich*® to them than the Jewish survivor girls and women, who were Eastern European. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So, during the day you're out 1n the <span class="DLF">field</span> and at night you're with a German Fraulein’. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">I can't tell you whether it's 100 percent of the soldiers or 99 percent that so engaged. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">But, and the officers, I mean, when I was running — when I was in military government, organizing and running that venereal disease hospital, a couple of officers from some nearby battalion, got in touch with my captain asking him to release a certain woman who was their girlfriend, or one of their girlfriends, I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And I had to stand up to this at the time, to the captain, he — turns out he was a really wonderful guy, a lawyer from Florida and say, "We can't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">She's got to stay <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="760">But, here these schmucks are bringing pressure on us to release a woman with venereal 78 genial (German) *° young woman (German) disease because she's one of their girlfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">So, this was very extensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">And, I guess, the way in which I've developed temperamentally over the years, because I was a, a, what do you call it, a fast achiever, a young achiever, is fundamentally, I don’t suffer fools easily or kindly. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I, I have too much experience in extremely difficult situations. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I know, I have confidence in my own sense of fairness and my own sense of integrity that, as anyone who has worked with me over the years knows, some of these truths about me, and I know them. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And so, when I get this kind of stuff — as my own confidence builds — I get more and more indignant. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">Maybe I was too young to be politic about some of my reactions, though, I don't think it was too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">There was one incidence described in the charges against me that I — that this officer says to me, something that they can’t do better on housing for the DP’s than they do for the GI’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And his — and I did this — the, the charges in front of a few enlisted men — and the claim is that I said to him, "Fuck the GI’s, I'm only worried about the DP’s" Now, later I go and I rendezvous with this officer, and I discuss the situation with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And he denies that there were any enlisted men in the vicinity, in our vicinity when we had that conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">And he also agrees that the essence of our conversation was that the GI’s are young men, they're trained to live under very difficult and trying conditions, so it won't be terrible, it wouldn't be terrible if you didn't have quite appropriate <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">But, here you're dealing with survivors from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> that have suffered so, who aren't trained for this kind of thing, who are families, children, wives. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">You can’t make a comparison between what you do for the GI’s and what you do for the DP’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">So, in effect, that conversation gets turned around as a charge of my being uncooperative, using disrespectful language, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">QUESTION:  I want to go back, just before we move into that and ask you: You were beginning to describe an atmosphere among a lot of the GI’s that they essentially sympathized, I think this is what you were saying, more with the German people in a way, than they did with the people you were working with, displaced persons, the raggedy looking person coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">ANSWER:  Katie, in the — in some of the material you have, I have, I have, I have inserted certain quotations from official documents that I have found in the Holo — in the <span class="BUILDING">National Archives</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Which is critical of the Jewish DP’s. "</span><span class="sentence" id="777">They flaunt themselves in front of the German police who they know can’t do anything about them. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And they do various things which will incur the wrath of the German population and which will encourage them to feel that Hitler after all was right." </span><span class="sentence" id="779">Now, that's an American officer writing that sentence in 1946.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">QUESTION:  Do you remember hearing things that, or feeling that tone, or witnessing something like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">ANSWER:  I, I, well...
QUESTION:  Do you remember hearing things like that, or feeling that tone, or witnessing something like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="782">ANSWER:  Well, I'm not sure that I heard those words, but I'm sure I heard things like it, and I've witnessed various.... Look, look at the other <span class="NPIP">thing</span> that — another, another — we haven't covered the famous riot. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">Well, I should precede this — though I'll come back to it — with a little bit of an outline, just so it's put into time context. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I send the cable to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> on the food situation, "stir up the bees," April 12th. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Within one week to the day after that, the battalion commander arrives for a five day intensive inspection. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">There has never been a five day intensive inspection. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">They come for a few hours here, here they drop in, send someone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Five days of inspection. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">That's undertaken on the 19th of April. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">And, let's say it. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">goes 'til the 24th of April. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">From my memorandum, I can see, tell, that there's a very active period from about May the ninth to May the 14th in which the Army 1s asking for my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">With all these different charges on Zionism and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I should add, unrelated to me and unrelated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fohrenwald</span> , on about May the ninth, there's riot in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp at</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="795">There's also a riot in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , I think, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starnberg</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Then on the evening of May 22nd, it's a Friday night, most — I and most of my team at our billets in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolfratshausen</span> the weekend is beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And, after dinner we start getting messages on the phone, there's trouble here, there's trouble this, someone is reported hurt at the <span class="BUILDING">German movie theater</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolfratshausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="798">We send someone out to look at it, no trouble at the <span class="BUILDING">movie theater</span> at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wolfratshausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Then, at some point, I see somebody in the car area of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , gesticulating and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And, he says there's trouble here, there's trouble there, I don't quite know what it all 1s, but what I do at that juncture — 1s I instruct two of our staff to stay at the billets in case there are anymore phone calls — I take two people with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I'm going to the <span class="BUILDING">German police station</span> to find out what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">I send the rest of the staff to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to see what's going on there. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">OK?

<p><span class="sentence" id="1003">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Well, of course, simply put, for me, the solution was that, hopefully, there would be developed a state in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">I didn't know by what name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">That all the refugees and DP’s *° Shimon Peres “! </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">Benjamin Netanyahu * Union (Hebrew); Israeli parliamentary bloc. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">3 Mifleget Po’alei Eretz Israel would go there and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> would dissolve. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I, you know, I saw some going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , some going to <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , where there were relatives, and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">But, to me, the bulk would be going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">There was a poll taken in the Spring of 1946 by the Anglo-American Committee”, this is from their report, they — I think this is part of the poll, [interviewee reads from notes] "In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> the vote for going to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was about 90 percent or more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Zone-wide, 70 percent wished to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">So, that was the overwhelming desire at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">I should add that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fohrenwald</span> was actually the last camp closed in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in about 1954. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">At some point in the process, I didn't keep up with it, UNRRA went out of business, was taken over by the International Refugee Organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">But, then it was turned over to the American Joint Distribution Committee and as they closed other <span class="BUILDING">centers</span> , they brought surplus into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fohrenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">And then it was closed, finally, in something like 1954.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1018">QUESTION:  Did you ever get the sense that people got attached to it, even with its problems, because, after all, it was a sort of safe haven? </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">It was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1020">ANSWER:  I don't, no, I never, never got that feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">I think people felt some element of safety there because on UNRRA, because of the Jewish Agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">There were also occasionally people around from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span> — which 1s a separate, I don't have much on it, because I didn't know much about it — but, remember, they were being organized in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzim</span> , there was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hochlandslager</span> , so there were, there were organizational structures that were providing some protection for people there that — and to that extent, it probably had a wholesome effect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">I mean, if, you've seen the picture from the Maccabi games, have you? </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">I mean, God, this is a year after the war, and you see these young people doing these acrobatics and exercises, it's nothing short of amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">Well that's morale building activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1026">QUESTION:  What was your sense of what was going on within the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Were they recreating their lives in their previous <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">Or were they creating some new type of life that they hoped would be their life in the future and in a future state?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1029">ANSWER:  I think that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fohrenwald</span> was a completely interim matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">I know this from my own relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">I know this from other people whom I've known. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">They came to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , they became part of that <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and either went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzims</span> , stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jerusalem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">If they were religious, they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bené Beraq</span> you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">They were like immigrants in any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , there was a period of adaptation and absorption. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fohrenwald</span> is a passing experience, about which they may have some benign “4 Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry on Palestine remembrance or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">Like this young woman, it, for some reason it — in her life it figures very importantly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1037">QUESTION:  The young woman you've been writing to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1038">ANSWER:  On the computer, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">The man who's in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Los Angeles</span> , I've had one or two exchanges with him, but he hasn't felt the need to go further, so, you know, it's a very variable thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">I should also say that I and others who returned were writing articles about this experience for three or four years after we returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">And giving speeches at different Jewish, or other, organizations, so we were sharing our experiences then in different ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">What’s, what I find interesting now from a few friends, and I don't know to what extent it's reflective, but a few friend whom — to whom I've sent the speech I gave a year ago in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Great Neck</span> , have written me saying they've shared it with their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">That 1s, people in my age group have a strong need to share these experiences with our children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">So, they used my experience which 1s reflective of their life to a certain extent, to share it with the children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1045">QUESTION:  Have you shared this with your children?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1046">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">And, I haven't had much feedback from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">They, they haven't verbalized feedback.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1049">QUESTION:  Tell us about the first Seder at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> when you were in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">It might have been the first Seder after liberation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1051">ANSWER:  Oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1052">QUESTION:  Would you tell us about that — what did it look like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1053">ANSWER:  Well, we had, I don't remember the <span class="INT_SPACE">dining room area</span> , but we had long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> all decked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I don't remember who led the service. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">I have pictures of me with different people there, including members of the team; Chaim Hoffman, who was the head of the Jewish Agency in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , was at our Seder. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And, we fed them gefilte fish as far as I can recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">Where we got some of the food to feed them, I don't know, I didn't ask. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">And there were Army people there and I don't think they knew what the hell they were eating, so they probably thought it was GI food also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">That is, a piece of gefilte fish to them was like a can of K-rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">They'd never had it before, it was from some other can. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">Maybe they were even happy to have never have had it before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">But it was a very buoyant, very friendly, very lively occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And I don't remember who had the afikomen, I don't know who stole it or found it, I don't remember any of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">But, we, you know, I see pictures which show these group dinners, different celebratory dinners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And though, that is, our commitment was to do positive things to raise morale. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And we did a lot of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">You know, I don't like these traumatic stories — to, to bury, the fact 1s we had hundreds of children in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and teachers teaching children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">We had a Yeshiva. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">Oh, and I came across an article, where — of Leivik's — where he devotes a piece of it to going into the Yeshiva in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fohrenwald</span> and it reminds him of his childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">So, we had that going here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">So, there was a lot of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1072">QUESTION:  A question that I didn't get to ask about just day-to-day living and you were describing the <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> being so small and privacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">How were married couples able to be intimate? </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">I mean, how, what, do you know anything about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Or how did people make do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1076">ANSWER:  I have deniability. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">No, but look, let's face it, Katie, I told you the story about my father as a six year old boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">His mother has died, his father is remarried, he has a stepmother who has two young children and he's occasionally awakened by some noise in the middle of the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And in the candle light he sees this stepmother feeding her children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">Now, that's a guess to me, that he lived in very close <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">So, he was experiencing in 1897, sex among adults at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">So, I think that a lot of these people who came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetlach</span> , really had that as part of their background. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">I, I've never talked to any of them about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">But, it's an interesting question and it’s an interesting issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">But, I think it was probably going on all the time and, not only with the children hearing it, but unrelated people were hearing it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">For us in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , it's quite a strange kind of experience, but, when you live — what do you think Indians did in a teepee, or Italians in their little hovels? </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">I think that was the world before we began building <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> with more than 1,500 square feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">And <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> with more, with four <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">End of Tape #6 Tape #7

<p><span class="sentence" id="1149">QUESTION:  That's interesting because in thinking about speaking with you, I know I'd hear about what this situation <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was — but I guess I didn’t really anticipate hearing that you would have to fight for the people over the treatment of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">In other words, that you had to become, or you did become, an advocate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">You had to choose sides in a way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">Do you agree with that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1153">ANSWER:  Oh, no, I didn't see it as choosing sides. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">I mean, some of the things that I was doing was almost measured choices, if you want to say down the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Like, my mid-— like my midnight checks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">Or the — three o'clock in the morning looking for a meat, for a butcher, once a month or twice a month, which left them 28 other days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">Or my encounter with Rabbi Halberstam in down the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">That is, I— even with those things — the Army was complaining like crazy about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">But I think, incidentally, if you were — which you are not going to do really, but historians will, look at the files on some of the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">Whether or not they led to the removal of the director or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">You'll see similar themes being played out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">Because I have folders based on meetings we were having at <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> where we were being briefed about not handing out cards and new cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">On how among us we were upset by it and protesting it and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">So, I wasn't the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And there was, for example, at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Landsberg</span> , you had older, older people in charge with more experience, like Lee Srole*? </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">who was chief welfare officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And they would get into the New York papers and Leon, what's his name, the head of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> so this was going on different <span class="NPIP">places</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1178">QUESTION:  What was the most difficult thing about your job?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1179">ANSWER:  I think when, when one comes down to it, the most difficult thing about it was dealing with the U.S. Army of occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">Dealing with the DP’s wasn't as difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">Dealing with Rabbi Halberstam wasn't that difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">I mean, you know, the riot was difficult, but it wasn't — I could understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">And, I remember once, I don't know for what reason, the DP’s went on a hunger strike protesting something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">I convened a big meeting in the <span class="BUILDING">auditorium</span> , hundreds of people there, and I, I set out to break the strike. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">And I say to them, "Listen, I would rather be a teacher in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> than director of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> " </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">And they laugh and that breaks the strike. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">That was the relationship I had with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">That was not difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">I had, I had confidence in my ability to deal with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">And they had confidence in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I notice in the stuff around the Army effort to get rid of me, that there's a memo from Becky Althoff who worked — there were two memos from Becky — she worked for the Joint, attached to the team, and one is to Leo Schwarz, the head of Joint in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , to alert him to what was going on up there and enlist him in the effort to offset the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">And the second, was talking about a small group meeting to plan a strategy, a group strategy, about * Leo Srole retaining me and protecting me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And that included Becky, some of the Jewish Agency people and one or two other staff people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">And then they had a large staff meeting the following morning and they wrote someone wrote a petition or something, and there are like 18 signatures on the petition. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">So, that was not my difficulty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">My difficulty was this anomaly of being an infantry soldier in the 39th Regiment and confronting this problem with those schmucks who have no understanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">I mean, look, one of these guys comes on an inspection during Pesach. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">I guess it must have been that guy who came for five days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">And we walk into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Now, the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> is closed for Pesach. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">They've been giving rations in one way or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">And, I walk with him into the middle of the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> it's empty and there's a pile of human defecation on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">And he, for him, that's a sign of poor administration and poor sanitary control. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">We walk to the <span class="INT_SPACE">johns</span> and there's defecation in the <span class="INT_SPACE">john</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , maybe on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet seat</span> , I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">We go <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and behind there against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , there's some defecation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">The stupid guy, how does he think I feel about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">I understand how he's feeling about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">But he's not giving a thought, that is he's not giving a thought that, if I had my way, if I had found it two hours earlier, we would have cleaned it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">But the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was out of use for two or three days at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">So, it happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">Nobody was going in there, so we didn't find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">You know, I won't tell you the whole story of this, in 1961, I am in — I'm working with my Mayor Wagner's office, I'm a senior management consultant on administration and I'm handling health, welfare, youth and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">The Deputy Mayor calls me up — I won't give you the whole story — gives me something, "Take care of this." </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">It's about <span class="BUILDING">Harlem hospital</span> , conditions in the <span class="INT_SPACE">emergency room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">I've been in the <span class="BUILDING">mayor's office</span> then five to six years, so I know what weight I have, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">And I've been heavily involved for two years in dealing with various problems of hospital administration. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">I call the Dean of the Columbia School of Public Health, whom I've been working with very closely for two years, and I say, "Help me out on this one, I'll rendezvous with you at the <span class="INT_SPACE">emergency room</span> at <span class="BUILDING">Harlem hospital</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">We go there, I won't detail what we find. </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">At the end of the evening, 10 o'clock at night, nine o'clock at night, I call the Commissioner of Hospitals at his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staten Island</span> , and I tell him where I am, what I have found and what I am doing, what I'm going to be doing about it immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">And he raises his voice, "What the hell are you doing there?

</span><span class="sentence" id="1224">Have you acted on it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">I'm acting because of dereliction." </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">Anyway, over the weekend, we took care of the problem and [inaudible] I report to the Deputy Mayor on Monday -"All taken care of." </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">On Wednesday, the Amsterdam News 60 comes out blasting us because it's a crazy paper, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">Ten days later, the Mayor announces that he's promoting me to Deputy City Administrator and 10 days after that, he's announcing that the Commissioner of Hospitals has resigned and he's appointing the Dean of the Columbia School of Public Health as Commissioner, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">So, I sort of know what heft and weight, and so on, 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">I didn't know it all in 1946 in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">But, there's something in me historically, my development, which has enabled me, not that I don't take crap, but gives me some inner strength not to always put up with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">And that was what was involved here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">Maybe I was too — whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">But they were too — worse, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">And I should add that two to three weeks after I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> there was another riot situation, a march on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and one or two Jews were killed by the soldiers because they wouldn't retreat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">That is, when facing a gun, they went forward, not backwards and we knew that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">And we knew that we had to deal with them within the family so they didn't see us with guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">And they didn't see the Army with guns. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">And when they saw the guns, they got hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">And I have newspaper clippings on that incident. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">So, I'm satisfied it wasn't a personality matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">Now, I have a memo that Ira Hirschmann, who was LaGuardia’s emissary, Hirschmann had been a Senior Vice President in <span class="BUILDING">department stores</span> in the '30s. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">He must have helped raise money for LaGuardia, later they became very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">During the war, Roosevelt appointed him with some special Ambassadorial rank to be stationed in <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , and Hirschmann was arranging for the escape of Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Bulgaria</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">So, he was, in his own way, an old hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And LaGuardia sent him over, he wanted to get rid of General Morgan*° because of the British influence on the European operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And he spent the day with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">And I quickly realized he was a guy I could trust and I get — put it all out to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">And in his memo, which is in June, "the Army is out to get Henry Cohen." </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">He starts out, "Henry Cohen" — this is something I didn't get until he came across it 1981, and he called me about it, that he had it — "Henry Cohen, director, who appears to have done a heroic job under impossible conditions is now under fire from the Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">They made an investigation here, found the sanitary conditions unsatisfactory, which is correct, and in addition they felt that Mr. Cohen was pushing the welfare side too much, was neglecting the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> for the rehabilitation of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">A devastating report has been sent to <span class="BUILDING">Headquarters</span> by General McBride*’, Ninth Division Commander, and they have asked for Mr. Cohen's removal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">The staff has protested and the entire community had a mass meeting, as, as the people have developed an affection for him and his understanding of the problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">Not like the U.S. Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">It was two days after this mass meeting that a riot occurred at this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">This is a concrete example of the Army bucking the job of rescue, failing to support and permit people who understand the human side of the problem to function’. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">The people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> chose to go on a complete hunger strike unless Mr. Cohen was retained. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">He will probably be removed by the Army."</span></p>

QUESTION:  I wonder when you think about the experience in terms of, we just talked about how it shaped you, but what it did to your personal perception of being a Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">Working with the displaced people and, you've written about the stories, etched faces.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1368">ANSWER:  Yeah, you know, I was so formed in that way, that it's hard for me to see other, the other increments which, I'm sure there are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">But, in 1949, when I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> teaching, I ran into some of my Israeli friends, either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">So, they arr— like they arranged my trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> , so they arranged, on the next holiday at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> — they used to run six week, trimester, six weeks in between — They arranged for me to go on an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">immigrant boat</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> — and Evelyn’?, </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">along with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">And then, not all the time, but half the time, they were putting us up in different <span class="NPIP">places</span> and so, I had the experience then of coming in on the Kedmah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">Into the <span class="DLF">Haifa harbor</span> early in the morning and seeing that <span class="BUILDING">Haifa amphitheater</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">Few people see it these days because no one comes in by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , but come in by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">What an experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">So, I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> on the first anniversary of establishment of the state. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">I stood on a <span class="DLF">roof</span> watching the parade and I lectured city planning at the <span class="BUILDING">Technion</span> ” and one or two other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">And, went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzim</span> and they arranged for a Fohrenwald reunion at WIZO*, the Woman’s Zionist Organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">They got announcements out in the press and radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">Three hundred people turned out’ So, there are these different increments and I don't, I haven't subaggregated it, you know?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1383">ANSWER:  No, you know, so overwhelming. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">You know, I remember on that particular visit, I was riding on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> and suddenly a man turns at me, extends his hand, and says, "Herr Direktor.</span><span class="sentence" id="1385">°®’ You know, that's a pretty heady experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">You know, you need some compensation for all the "sturm und drang." </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">So, I've demonstrated I can take the "sturm und drang" and I'm entitled to some of the things that come with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">You know, it's like combat, hat — I don't get much out of that, I didn't get anything out of Ninth Division — but what I got out of it was my own sense of inner satisfaction at having served. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">And, but it's, it's an interesting part of history because there were really so few people around and it tells one so much about institutions — good and bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">And, but I'm sure most of the people, whether they came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I ran across one fellow for many years, who went into the <span class="REGION">engineering area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">Another fellow was a dermatologist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">I came across a letter just yesterday and I went to the phone book to see if 3 wife of interviewee 4 Israel Institute of Technology >> Women’s International Zionist Organization °° Mr. Director (German) he was still around and I didn't see his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">I saw his second name, but not his first name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">I may call some of the relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">But, in that sense, you can't recreate it, you can't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">And yet, it has to be an important part of the history.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1397">QUESTION:  Do you know anything about what it is now? </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">Has it been razed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1399">ANSWER:  Oh, I'll tell you, no, it still, it's been reconstructed as a, as a, some kind of community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">Because Susan Levin — who was born in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in about 1948 — visited it about three years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">I ran into her, she told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">But, what's happened in 50 years, as in most <span class="REGION">urban areas</span> , 1S that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> has spread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">The urbanization has spread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">The suburbanization 1s part of the urbanization, so I have an impression that today it, that <span class="REGION">area</span> , is simply a stop on whatever rapid transit system <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> has. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">So, she — yeah, anyway, she went there, I don't know if she knocked on a <span class="DLF">door</span> or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">No.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1408">QUESTION:  You mentioned there being a lack of <span class="INT_SPACE">community space</span> at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">Therefore, what, what did people do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">Where did they congregate? </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">Where did they sit around and gossip? </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">I mean — or did that not happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1413">ANSWER:  Yeah, well, there was a big <span class="BUILDING">community center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">There was a big kitchen facility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">I don't remember now what the <span class="INT_SPACE">lateral space</span> around the <span class="BUILDING">community center</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">So I mean — so people are talking when they're standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> waiting for food. '" </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">There were programs in the <span class="BUILDING">community center</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> — I don't know whether every night, I don't remember that — but, they must have been fairly frequent. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">On the other hand, there is also evidence that people didn't rely completely on the movies we were showing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">They went to the <span class="BUILDING">cinema</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">Incidentally, I, I, I neglected to say this, it hadn't occurred to me at the time, on the — at the time of the riot, one of the things that I realized was that there would be Jewish DP’s in the <span class="BUILDING">cinema</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">By the time the movie was over, they would, word would be getting around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">I didn't know what would be happening to them when the movie let out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">So, we took a batch of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobiles</span> en route to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> , en route to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and we stopped off at the <span class="BUILDING">cinema</span> and, during a break in — when they were changing the film, I made an announcement that when it was over we'd pick them up and take them back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">Most of them left then and there, they didn’t wait for the end of the <span class="BUILDING">cinema</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">So, anyway, people did different things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">They went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , that is, they — you know, I'm not — there were—
QUESTION:  They could come and go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1427">ANSWER:  They could come and go, they, they were, they had friends or relatives in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">So, there, there was no computer, so people learned to be in touch with one another by conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">I noticed in the camp newspaper there are several pages of listings of people looking for people from different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">So, that was another communication system.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1434">ANSWER:  Well, most people were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">Or they were in classes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">The only ones, other than the black marketers, but they were working, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">They were outside handlin°’. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">Just as a word, y g y I came across in my notes, reference to the chief of police, allegations with regard to him and the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> came to me and I let it go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">That was a big one, whatever it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1440">QUESTION:  The DP police?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1441">ANSWER:  Yeah, I let him go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">And there were some charges about the chairman of the camp committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">And I went to the camp committee and I discussed it and they suspended him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">I don't have any further record of what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">So, people were engaged, remember food took time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">You had to wait on <span class="DLF">line</span> three times a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">Not everyone was waiting, people would come back to the families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">Now, there were the women and the pregnant women, and they had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">They were taking care of children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">So, there were some, we had, we didn't have <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> for a mikvah, you know that’s a ritual bath. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">So, you know, there were problems, but it isn't as 1f people were locked in <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">See, that was a big difference between this and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">They had a little money, they — you know, however they got it, could move somewhere or other. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">I don't remember how we dealt with the money problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">We may even have had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> that went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> twice a week or — for some hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">I don’t remember.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1461">ANSWER:  I guess, I guess that's part a function of the breakdown of the inner self. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">Now, I know no one in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> has ever felt an overwhelming impulse to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , to urinate or to defecate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">I know that no one in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> has ever had the experience of letting a little go in the underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">But even under such pressures as that, people with an inner discipline, shoot desperately to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they can let go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">Alright? </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">So, one has to assume in these cases — not with the freezing in the winter, that was a different situation, I — but, here Passover, in April, one has to assume that someone or several, had certain impulses and there was not enough of an inner discipline to move them to an appropriate <span class="NPIP">place</span> to discharge. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">That's my, how else can I explain it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">Can you think of another explanation? </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">>’ trading, doing business (Yiddish)

<p><span class="sentence" id="1485">ANSWER:  Well, one thing, probably, you asked me about Jewish matters before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">See, I'm, I'm an amalgam of Jewish and universalist, and, and humanist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">And, I believe very strongly in this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">But, I also believe that one of the most powerful engines in homo sapiens is the existence, and probably the necessity, for the "We/they" relationships. </span><span class="sentence" id="1489">So, when I think about the "we/they" relationships in the context of my being Jewish and universalist, it means to me, in terms of Jewishness, pride, fullness in certain ways, identification, values. </span><span class="sentence" id="1490">But, in a certain sense, as "we," we shouldn't kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">We should find a way of relating to the "they." </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">All "they's" should find ways of relating to the "we's." </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">So, in a certain sense in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> the "we" part was strengthened, as, as against the need for balance in the "we/they" phenomenon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">And the Army that I was dealing with — which I don't generalize to the whole Army, became the they, more than the Germans — became the they, in a sense — and that probably does make me feel a little uncomfortable — because for me, I strong — I believe strongly that all people need to have a "we" relationship, but they shouldn’t convert that "we" relationship into a hostile, hostility to "they." </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">You see? </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">I mean, if you take for example, that thing I went through quickly with you, about <span class="BUILDING">Harlem hospital</span> , where I was going in to do a lot of good, and did, the outcome in the Amsterdam News three days later, five days later was from their "we" into an act of aggression against the "they." </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">And it was so, so uninspired, so uncalled for. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">And, so you get this all the time, and, and because, sometimes it’s because of the way in which they act. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499">That is the Katyusha’® rockets make our we act in certain ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="1500">And that distresses me, even though I accept the counteraction. </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">But, I basically prefer for the <span class="DLF">walls</span> to come down a little bit more among people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">Even though they need for their well-being, a "We" relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">So, in, in — at <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> , because of the behavior of some of these officers and soldiers, they were building up some of the <span class="DLF">walls</span> in me that I feel uncomfortable with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">But, <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , even Rabbi Halberstam had a little bit of that, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">So, I — but I've learned — what I've been leafing all my life, is the complexity of the “we/they" relationships. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">I mean, people today focus, among other things, among a million things, focus on <span class="COUNTRY">Sri Lanka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">I've been watching the <span class="COUNTRY">Sri Lanka</span> phenomenon for 20 years, °8 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Lorry</span> mounted multiple rocket launcher (Russian) now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">I always find these things that are illustrations of that, that bother me, disturb me, but show how difficult it is to deal with.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1509">QUESTION:  I'd like ask you to show us this picture that hangs in your <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> , and—
ANSWER:  This picture is me speaking to the hundreds upon hundreds of people collected for the Maccabi games. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">Which was an athletic festival in, I don't know, probably May, because the weather was fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">It could have been June. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">And, we had hundreds of younger people engaged in acrobatics and all kinds of athletics and it was a really a marvelous day. [</span><span class="sentence" id="1513">technical conversation |
ANSWER:  This is me pointing something out to General Frederick Morgan who was the head of UNRRA in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">He had been Eisenhower's Deputy British Commander during the European invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">He was the highest British military officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">And, and I took him to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , there are other pictures of him in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and the vocational training facilities and in different parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1517">ANSWER:  Okay, this is a picture of a Rabbi, I believe it's Yitzhak Herzog, who was the Chief Rabbi of <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">He came to spend the Sabbath weekend with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">And, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was just in a state of exhilaration over his visit because, for the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , this was a new beginning, new life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">Now, I just want to point out, at his right shoulder, is an American by the name of Rabbi Wohlgelerinter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">I've never, never figured out whom the hell he was representing, but he was around all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">Now, when you look beyond Rabbi Herzog's right shoulder, partly cut by his hat, is the Mizrachi Rabbi, I can't remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">He was a marvelous human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">We used to call him the red rabbi because he had red hair compared to the Rabbi Halberstam, who had black hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">Then at Rabbi Herzog's left shoulder is Gustav Lachman, who was chairman of the camp committee, a wonderful man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">He became a high school principal in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">And then beyond his left shoulder is me in Army dress, or UNRRA dress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">I should add that Rabbi Herzog was the father of Rabbi Chaim Herzog, who was the President of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">And, some years ago when I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I put together an album with the pictures I had of Rabbi Herzog and I got an audience with the President. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">And we went over it, he was a young soldier, he was approximately my age, he was in the British Army, and he remembered clearly that visit of his father to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">So, we had a wonderful 15, 20 minutes together reminiscing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">This is a picture of a flag raising ceremony in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hochlandslager</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">Where we were training some three to 400 young people as agricultural workers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutzim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">Standing in back of me is the Jewish Agency team. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">To the right as you look at the picture, Sarah Entin passed away, unfortunately, early. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">Next to her is Liowa Lak, whom I've spoken about before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">And next to him is Zviah Lahar, whom I also spoke about before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">She was the one who called me after the Hebron massacre. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">This was around Passover time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">And again, a lovely occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">What can I say about this picture? </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">The thing that I always react to when I look at a picture like that, is how much eagerness and smiles are on the faces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">Because that's the thing that I most want to see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">And you see it in there, including that head in the back who is raising his chin so he'll get into the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">End of Tape #9 Conclusion of Interview </span>
