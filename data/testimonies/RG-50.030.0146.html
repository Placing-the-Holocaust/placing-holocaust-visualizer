<p><span class="sentence" id="23">QUESTION:  Did you go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">ANSWER:  And I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in kinder... I remember going to <span class="BUILDING">kindergarten</span> , and then into the <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And then when um my grandmother got sick, my...and died...my mother had to come and get me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Um, my mother took care of my brother and my sister, who were older of...of me, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Being that my father was here in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> --he came here before the war--um, my mother had a hard time raising the three children. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So I was split up; and my grandma took care of me, being that I was the youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And my mother took care of my brother and my sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">There in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> , my mother had um an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Uh, we lived right in the heart of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And um my mother had a <span class="BUILDING">atelier</span> , which means like a working...a workshop. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And um she made raincoats. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Um, in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> it rains a lot; and um a lot of people used to make raincoats there. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And we made it from scratch, from... And um we sewed and we glued; and they made raincoats. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And that's how she made a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And um when I came there in 1939, um I was a year with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">When one morning in 1940, I woke up early in the morning hearing um noises and didn't know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And I heard: pouff. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Um, like explosions. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And um we went to the <span class="DLF">window</span> and we looked up in the <span class="DLF">sky</span> , and there I saw white um clouds--like puffs, like snowballs. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And um I realized it was like from um cannon balls. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Or whatever, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">We ran down the <span class="DLF">street</span> ; and people came down and we were all in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">And we found out that the um Germans were invading um <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">And um it was early spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">In May. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And um mid-afternoon, the Germans walked down, in parade, into the main <span class="DLF">street</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And this 1s how they came in and invaded <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And that's when our troubles started, with the Jewish people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">They started very slowly with the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Because they were afraid um to start very hard on us, because they were afraid of rebellion. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">They did not know how the reaction would be from the Belgian people. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So they started the curfew, and with um yellow patch-we had to wear the yellow patch, which meant...which said "Jude.” </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And we had um to give ...um all information about ourselves we had to give them. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And um we had to give up um our um... I don't know if we had to give up our passports or not; but um I knew there was...I know that there was curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And um they started asking for volunteer jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">People should volunteer, and give um um for jobs to go to um <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And a lot of people thought that if they would um go and volunteer, that they um would be safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So a lot of people volunteered and went away, and we never heard about them again. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So the people were scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">After that, when they saw they didn't get any volunteers, they started raiding sections of um <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And this was um in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">At that time, I was very very lucky; because um I developed... I...I was a little girl who always suffered of tonsillitis, and being the condition of...um the situation the way it was, my mother was afraid if anything should happen to me that um I would get very sick, and I would... Um, God knows what would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">She says, "Lilly needs her tonsils out.” </span><span class="sentence" id="66">So she put me in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> to take my tonsils out. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And um in the meantime, she had made arrangements with a lady who worked in mother's um atelier--in her <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> --that she knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">She was a Belgian lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">She worked for my mother many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And um she said she was going to help my sister, Marya, find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Because the Germans were getting very um um--how should I say? </span><span class="sentence" id="72">They tried to pick up people in the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , and um and they were already um grabbing people everywhere to put them into transports and send them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">So my mother wanted to um save my sister; and this lady said, um, "I will help find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> for her.” </span><span class="sentence" id="74">And sure enough, one day she came and she says, "I have an address where Marja can go and hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">It is out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And this man is a farmer, and he will keep Marja until after the war.” </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So my mother was very grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">She made um a suitcase ready for her, and sent her off to that <span class="DLF">farm</span> with this woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">And while I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , one day my mother came to visit me. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And I could see that she had been crying, and she was very sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I says, "Ma, what's the matter? </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Why are you crying?" </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So she broke down, and she told me that Marja had been taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I says, "How come?" </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I said, um, "You put her away to be hiding in...1n...in a <span class="DLF">farm</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="86">She says, "The man denounced her.” "</span><span class="sentence" id="87">How did he... Why?," </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I asked. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And um later, I found out as I got older from my family, he tried to um force my sister they should have relationships with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And my sister was young, and...and she said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I'd rather go to the Germans.” </span><span class="sentence" id="92">She said, "I'm...I'm...I'm not going to have any of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And um I...I will not let you do this to me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And he threatened her; and he says, "If you don't," he says, "I'm going to denounce you!" </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And sure enough, he did denounce her. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And the reason how we know it is because a postal card came to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">When she was um taken out of um to transport from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> to um the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> she had slipped a postal card through...through the cracks of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And um early in the morning as people were going to work and the farmers were going to work in their <span class="DLF">fields</span> , they would pick up notes and cards that people dropped from the um <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And um this is how we got our card from my sister, saying, "Beware of this woman, because she she took me to this man who wanted to have relationship with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">And I wouldn't give in, and I got denounced.” </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So my mother being very naive about it; and um she seeked that woman out and made problems for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And sure enough, that woman denounced my mother and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And how she did it is this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I had a grandfather, who--in those days, in 1942, they didn't bother with the old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">They wanted the young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So my mother and my brother, who was left, they um went and took um a <span class="INT_SPACE">furnished room</span> someplace and hid. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And they left my grandfather in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> where my mother lived originally. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But she knew my...my um Zayde--which is my grandfather--had no food, and she worried over him. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So she went and cooked him some soup, and she was going to bring it to him to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And as she turned around the corner from the <span class="DLF">street</span> and our <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> was right at the corner, she saw the Germans waiting there for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">This woman knew that my mother was bringing soup to my [grand]father; and um my mother was caught right there and then. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">My...my mother and my brother ran across the <span class="DLF">street</span> into a <span class="BUILDING">grocery store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And the Germans came after her in that little <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and they took her away. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">The reason I know about this is because--um I have to go back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">When um I came out of the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , I had an aunt who was hiding out 1n the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">She said to my mother, "Bring Lilly to me, so she can recuperate from her tonsil um operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And let her stay with me a few days.” </span><span class="sentence" id="118">So while I was recuperating and staying with my mother-- um, with my aunt--excuse me--a...a call came to us from neighbors from our <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">From gentile people. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And told my aunt, "Do not bring Lilly back to this address, because her mother and brother were just taken away.” </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And this is how I stayed with my aunt and my uncle, and in hiding in, out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Which is the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And um um...and I was hiding there until 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">In the meantime, the rest of my family were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Little by little, they picked them up; and they were all caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Except this aunt of mine who kept me, and another aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Another aunt, she had two little girls and she gave them to um um...not an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> ...
QUESTION:  A <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  ..um, a <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And um the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> kept them for a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Then they got very very nervous about it; and they called my aunt, and um my aunt had to place the children someplace else. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So she finally hired a lady who was willing to um take care of those two children while my aunt was um doing housework for gentile people and pretending she was Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">She would do housework, and she would pay that lady every month. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And she kept those two children. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And um so I was in hiding with my other aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And in order to survive--because the money was running out a little bit--and um...and to make ends meet, the people who um we lived with in our <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> um knew that I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And um they said, "Lilly, let's call you Lilliane from now on.” </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They were very, very nice to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And they liked me very much, and they helped me as much as they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And um and life was really not that bad while I was in hiding with my aunt and uncle. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">There was a little <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> right next to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And um when the Germans um came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> and raided us, they um took over that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and they started making camouflage for the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">So this man um knew that I was hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And he says, "Lilly, come in and work for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Nobody will know that you are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And whatever you make will help you to buy groceries.” </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And so I did this. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And um...so one day--I'll never forget--one day, um the owner of these people said, um, "Lilly, I'm entertaining um German people tonight for dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And they're big to-do people, and I would like you to come and do um the dishes and help us in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">You won't have to come in the <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> , but you'll be just in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="150">In the meantime, while I was doing the work during the day in that little <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , I also was doing part-time um...I was doing manicuring in a <span class="BUILDING">beauty shop</span> up the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And I was making tips. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And all this helped me in that I could give that money to my aunt and my uncle for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So I learned to make manicuring. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And so I um couldn't say no to the people, because I was grateful that they were giving me the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">But I says, "I'm Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I'm scared to be near them.” </span><span class="sentence" id="157">He says, "Lilly, I assure you that nothing will happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I will not tell the Germans that um you are there, that you...

id="389">If we don't work, they're going to take us to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="390">So anytime there was work for volunteers, we volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">We stood up. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">The young girls, we all stood together as a group. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">That the girls came out of <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We had made a pact that we should stick together, because all the parents was taken together in the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="395">So they said, "Let us stick together, and let's try and survive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="396">So one day...we were doing over there very hard labor work. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">We were doing <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="398">Or they told us to pick up rocks and...and...and carry them from one <span class="DLF">hill</span> to the other <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">What we accomplished, I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">They just wanted us to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And they were going with the um whips and hitting us, while we were doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">In the cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">One day...we were always looking for other jobs, because that would kill us if we would do this everyday. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">So one day they came, and they volun...and they said, "There is anew camp opening up. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And we need volunteers to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And we grabbed that opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And there was about um twenty-five, thirty girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And um we were lucky enough to be taken to take that job. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">So they took us. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">And we showered, and they gave us new clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And we went to work into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And we found out that that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="413"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> is maybe like um a mile, a mile and a half, away from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="414">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp I</span> was in was called 2-B Lag...um Lager. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Zwei-B Lager. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">And that was a new lager that they had opened up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And we started working in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Well, the work was so hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">It was even harder than the other work. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Because we had to get up before the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> um got um woken up, so that um we should make the coffee ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And cut the bread, the um um the rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And prepare the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So we worked very very hard, dragging these heavy things. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And I was a young girl, I had no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And I had to drag those heavy um cans of um soup and coffee liquids out. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And um...like in the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And it was only two people per...per barrel, whatever they called it. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">We had to carry it all the way out from the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> to the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , so that the inmates could come and pick it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And I cried myself to sleep because of the hard work. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">And over there, that's the way I was for six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">In the meantime, while life was going on over there, it was very very rough for all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">We were trying to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Transports were coming in every day, from all different <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">People with all kinds of different languages--Hungarian, Poles, Czechoslovakians, from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ... They were from ever...<span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> ... There were eve...Poles, Russians... They were from everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">It was a melting pot. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And everybody spoke in different languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And one day--I'll never forget--a whole transport of Hungarian people came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Women and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And...into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ... I was surprised--even children; because um they only had adult people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And then I found out that these...that transport, that Hungarian transport--it was two...two um <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> that they filled up with--that they were going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">And they had no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So I took a bucket of boiled potatoes, and... At night, I had made up my mind to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And I was going to sneak into one of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and give as much as I can to each person. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">I would give them a bowl of potato. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Because we cooked always one day ahead, and we um made um...to make the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">So that's how I was able to take um a bucket of boiled potatoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Well, in the beginning it went nice and quietly. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">But then as people find out they were getting...somebody was giving them food, I...1 come...made a whole um commotion with all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">And all of a sudden the lights turned on, and the blockalteste--which is the um the lady in charge of that <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> --op...opened up the lights and saw me. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And um she saw what I was doing; and she says, "You know, I could denounce you where you could be shot right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And then what you're doing?" </span><span class="sentence" id="453">She says, "Give me that bucket, and get back to your <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> where you belong!" </span><span class="sentence" id="454">And um the next day they were all liquidated, all these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">They were all gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And I could have lost my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">I didn't realize what I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">But I felt in my heart that I wanted to help these people, and this is all I could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And one day I had to take out the coffee early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">It was my mine um time to take out the coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And I took a woman who um...from...from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> who was going to help me; and she was inexperienced. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">There was a um way to um carry it in order not to spill it. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">You ...you pick up something heavy, you...you... I was told you pick it up, and you go straight with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">If you bend and you...then you have the whole weight of the um...of the um...of the um can, and it weights you down. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But if you go straight, then you carry it with your whole body. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So you can walk with it straighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">So this poor woman was a weak person. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">She didn't know how to carry it, and she was wobbling back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And this was boiling coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And she finally dropped it on me, and then she took off and ran; and I got burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I got burned on my leg, and um was severely burned on my left foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And they took me to the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">The <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> was all the way in the end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Nobody ever wanted to go to the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> ; because, first of all, there was no medication there anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">But in...people who were almost really dying would go to the <span class="BUILDING">infirmary</span> ; and from there, they carried them out to be burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Not only that, they would take out um people and...and...and to be gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">But I went there to have just my bandage changed; because where the um big um can fell on my foot, it scraped all the skin off. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And um so I needed bandages on...on my foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So as I was being waiting for my um turn to um change the bandage, all of a sudden a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> stopped and in came Dr. Mengele. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And I saw death in front of my eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">And he wanted to know what I was doing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">So I said to him right away, "I am working. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And I'm working 1n the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , and I had an accident.” </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And I told him what happened. "</span><span class="sentence" id="485">And I'm just waiting to have my um bandage exchanged.” </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And he said, "OK.” </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And he let me exchange my bandage; and I went right out and I had two girls helping me walk back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And as I was walking back with the two girls, I was putting my heel down into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and I was hopping that way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">But being that the <span class="DLF">pavement</span> was always full of mud...there was no dry pavement. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">We were always in mud up in to our ankles. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">All of a sudden, I heard the brakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">And I looked behind, and there is the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> with Dr. Mengele and two guards right next to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">He always had two guards, just in case somebody wants to kill him I presume. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">So he had two guards with their rifles; and he had a sho...a revolver in his waist. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">So the um driver stopped, and he started screaming at me in German--how dare I jump...how dare I walk with my heel on...on...with my bad foot in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mud</span> when my bandage has just been changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">He said, "What do you think we do here, exchange bandages for you so that you can make them muddy? </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Jump on one leg, or else!," </span><span class="sentence" id="498">he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Well, I started jumping on that one foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And if it wouldn't have been for those two girls who were holding me, I would have collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">And I thought any moment he was going to shoot me or tell me to get on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="502">I thought he was going to put...take me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And how I walked into that <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , I'll never know. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">We were all three of us exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">He followed me and trailed slowly behind me; to make sure that I was going into the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> for one, and also that I jumped on one leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And that's how I...he took off, I know it. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And that's how I escaped his death claws. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I'll never forget that, with this Dr. Mengele. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">And finally it healed up. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">I still have a scar in my leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And um every day was um a struggle to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">Every day, I woke up and I would find one or two people who wanted to end their lives and couldn't take it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">They would throw themselves to the electric wires and make a end of it, because the electric wires would electrocute them. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And every once in a blue moon, I wouldn't...I couldn't take it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I would try to sneak out of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> at late at night, when we were not supposed to be; because we could have been shot right there if a German would see us at night out in out of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="516">But I would sneak behind the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and I would go all the way in the back. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And I would try and look at the <span class="DLF">sky</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And I would see the <span class="DLF">sky</span> ... would see the stars. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">And I would talk to myself; and I would say, "I can't believe that these stars are looking down at us in this <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> , in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and the same stars are shining at the outside of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And other people are looking at the same stars, and they are free. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And they are free to do what they want to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And they are living a good life. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">And we are here in <span class="NPIP">Hell</span> --human beings worse than animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">And nobody is doing anything about it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="525">And I couldn't believe it, and I would say...and I would... As young as I was, I...I was asking myself these questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And I would say, "Where is the world? </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Why isn't the world doing anything about this?" </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And then I would question God; and I would say, "Where is God? </span><span class="sentence" id="529">How can he let us being killed like that?" </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Naturally, I had no answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">And after I cried myself out real good, I would go back to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">And face the morning, and stay in "Appell" for hours again in the cold, and then go to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="533">Finally, one day, one morning, I heard that <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Somehow, somehow--I don't know how it came, um maybe from the underground--but the news came to me that <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">And I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="536">And I was so happy; and I had such terrible mixed emotions, because I was happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I said, "My aunt is liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">My Aunt Sarah did not get caught.” </span><span class="sentence" id="539">It never dawned on me that she could have been caught and gone into another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I never...never even thought of that. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">But in my mind, she was liberated; and in another way, I was so sad that I was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I was still here. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And then one morning again, world...word came to us that we were going to evacuate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">Why were we evacuating <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="544">It is because the Russians were coming close by. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">And so we...we all walked out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and we started walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And we started walking, we walked for days. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">I'll never forget it. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">I don't know how many days we walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">We walked, and then we took <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , and then we walked again. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">And as we walked, we heard gunshots. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And they told us to keep on marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">We heard gunshots; and they were shooting people in the back who couldn't keep up with the walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">It ended up being called the "death march," because the ravines and the...and the gutters, they were all red from blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">From people...

and...and people were...got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">People got diphtheria, the runs; and it was terrible catching. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And um finally, the little girl got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I...you would go and stay in front of <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> , hoping that somebody would see me that knew me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I was hoping would give me something. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">And finally, um twice some people gave me--one time a little bit of coffee and one time a little bit of soup--that I ran back to Christiane to give it to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">And Christiane died in my arms while I was feeding her a little bit of the coffee. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">I wanted her to have a little bit of hot um coffee, and she died in my arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">But before she died, she had gotten delirious from the fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Afterwards, I found out it was typhus that she had. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And she got delirious. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">It was the middle of the night, and she saw her family in her fever. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So she started...she got up, and she wanted to run to her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">She cried in French, "Mama!" </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And she wanted to go to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">And, naturally, she was stepping on the sleeping people, and she made a commotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">So I tried to calm her, and lay her down. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And while I was trying to calm her, the Blockalteste--which is the woman in charge of the um <span class="BUILDING">barrack--</span> came down on me with a stick. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And she started beating me. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">She beat me so much, until the the stick broke. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And I laid there for two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I couldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I was so bruised and broken up. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And it was right after that that Christiane died.</span></p>

QUESTION:  We're on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">ANSWER:  So Christiane died in my arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">When Christiane died, I did not let know...I didn't tell the Blockalteste that she was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I pretended she was asleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I put her down and covered her up. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And I pretended she was asleep, because I received her ration of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And I took that ration and soup, and ate it for two days. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And then after that, I was afraid that she would start smelling, and that they would discover and they would hurt me again. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So I said to the woman, the Blockalteste, that she had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">When Christiane...when they found out that she was dead, they took Christiane. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And they took her out, and they threw her on top of a pile of dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I said, I compared the two differences of the two different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="640"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , they took away the dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">They gassed them and they burned them; and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> we didn't see any dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">We only saw the um people being hit or being dragged away, but we never saw any dead people laying around. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , was just the opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="644"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> was nothing but dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Skeletons. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">Skin and bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">They piled them up as they died. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">Every day, five people would be dead from...from one <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">And they just piled them up, like a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in front of the um <span class="DLF">door</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">And the piles got as high--I would say um six, seven feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Because I remember when they... First, in the beginning, I couldn't look at her. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I was afraid to look at Christiane on top of that pile. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I knew where she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And I knew what she had on. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Christiane had a skirt--a little skirt, a thin little skirt--and a navy blue jacket. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And finally my guilt couldn't take it any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I said I had to go and look at Christiane. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">So I went out, and I looked at Christiane. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And one thing puzzled me...and I didn't understand what was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Christiane's skirt was taken away, and she was bare from the waist down. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">Nothing but bones and skeleton. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Just like you see in the...in the pictures, or in the movies they show. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And she had a white jacket on. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I says, "Why is her jacket white? </span><span class="sentence" id="665">Why would somebody take off the blue jacket, and put a white jacket?" </span><span class="sentence" id="666">So I went closer by of the pile...to the um skeletons, the dead people. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And I looked up; and underneath that white, I saw the navy blue. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And the outside of the white was lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Big white lice, like the size of black ants that you see sometimes, the black ant crawling in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">dirt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">That's as big as those lice were. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And they covered that navy blue little jacket; and it made the jacket look white or grayish. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And it shocked me so that I almost fell on the... under the dead cadavers. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And I ran away and I never looked at Christiane again anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">I was so...it...1t...1t just took everything out of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I couldn't take it. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">They were eating Christiane up, this... From...from...from the terrible--the lice, the decay, the filth. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And this is how she ended up, a young fifteen year old girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And after that, I was so disillusioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I had nothing to fight anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">My morale was so down. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">And I think I came down with the typhus what Christiane had. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And I couldn't work anymore, and I couldn't get up anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And I laid there; and one day I had to go to the um <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And I had to go at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And they...and I fell; and coming back from the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , somebody pushed me and bruised me on my leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And from the bad nutrition and the bruise developed into a terrible big bruise. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And I don't know what happened to my leg, but it was like on fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And no medication, and no um um medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">It...1t was like um um a fire was on my leg, and a bump; and um I would not let nobody touch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And I was very weak with the typhus, and I couldn't walk anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And I laid there like a Skeleton. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">And this is how I was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">When I was liberated, I couldn't um lift my head up. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Finally, after two days, I asked two inmates to pick me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">And I could look out the <span class="DLF">window</span> and see what a soldier looked like. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And then they laid me down again. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And then I found out, after the um... probably days, told the um...the um army... They took all these sick people, the ones that were the worst off for um give them immediate help. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">So one um Red Cross came, and they said they were going to take me away the next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">And so they took off all my clothes that I had on; and they wrapped me in an army blanket, and they took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">And they um took and put me in um a <span class="BUILDING">bathing house</span> ; and they took the Germans who were the Nazis, they made them put on white uniforms and they took care of our...of the inmates who were very bad off. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And they washed me and shampooed me, and um then they put me in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">In the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , they made um...they set up an <span class="BUILDING">emergency hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , I remember an Englishman...I could see in his face that my leg was bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And I had a translator tell me that he was going to do the best to save my leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">And um he operated on me; and um I understand that gangrene had set in the leg from um the um pus, and had reached the bone. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Anyhow, I was two months in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> fighting for my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">And then, they um...finally after two months and I got some of my strength back, they took me back with the Belgian Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I remember, one day I saw some soldiers going from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">And on the lapel, I...1 recognized the Belgian flag. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I star...I started talking French to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And they were very excited to find a Belgian girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And um they made all the inquiries about me, and they um called the Belgian Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And sure enough, all the information I had given them was correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">So they sent me back to <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">Because a lot of inmates after their liberation, they all wanted to get out and wanted to go back to um <span class="REGION">neutral zones</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">They didn't want to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">So um they had to check it real closely; and when all the information was correct, they sent me back. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">Finally, the Belgian Red Cross took me back to um <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> by um <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">Ao I traveled back with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army airplane</span> ; and I was one of the very very few who were very very injured and weak, and couldn't travel, that was sent back by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="720">And when I came back into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , the Belgian um Red Cross asked me where I should go, where...who they could notify. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And I didn't know where my aunt was, so I told...I gave the address of the people where I was in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">The Belgian people who took care of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">And they came right away and got me. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And I stayed there two days, when word came to my aunt from that lady who had saw my name that um...that I was there.</span></p>

and I loved her very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">And she wanted very much for me to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , because her dream as a child was always to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="808">And I said, "I don't want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I want to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="810">And she convinced me. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">She says, "You don't know <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="812">You don't know <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="813">What difference does it make where you start your life? </span><span class="sentence" id="814">Go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for me, and help me and bring me down to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> when you will be able.” </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And so I felt so bad, I...I said, "OK.” </span><span class="sentence" id="816">And that's how I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> to be with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And it's funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">There um was a play last winter called "Shayne Maydel.” </span><span class="sentence" id="819">And I found out about that play. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">I went to see it; and it's almost like my life, that um play. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And I went and I spoke for the people who were in the play, and for the...and the audience, one night; because it was parallel just like my story. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">And um except that the sister who was in that play--and I have um a half-sister here from... from my father and my step-mother, who...she was very very young and didn't understand what I was all about--while this sister in the play wanted to help the new um sister who was the survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And with me, it was just opposite. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">And um my step-mother didn't help me at all when I was young and...and came here, in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">But anyhow, I was just one year with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And met...um married um my husband after I met him for three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And thank God, it's already...yesterday was 42 years that we are married together. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And we have three wonderful sons, and three beautiful grandchildren and a fourth coming on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And they know. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Um we've talked to them many times, my children, about the Holocaust and what we have gone through. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">And um I think they understand what makes us tick and what makes us different people, because of what we went through in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">We tried to be as normal as we can be. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And I think we are normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">But inside of us, we will never be the same as any other person who has never been in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="835">It isn't possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">Because of what we went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Because there's not a day that does not go by that we don't think of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or of death. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">And of what we had to go through in life, which was then. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">It was just terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">How we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">It was so inhuman. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">Animals were taken care... better...had better love and care as...than we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">I remember when we...when I came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , it...it...1t was such a <span class="NPIP">Hell place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And when it rained, and...and the ashes flew down from the <span class="BUILDING">crematoire</span> on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">We were living with death all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And the smell, and the odor. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">It was 1m...impossible to describe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">And I cannot believe to think that the people in the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , who lived around there, who claimed that they didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I cannot believe that they say they didn't know what went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Because they must. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">If we smelled it, they smelled it;
