ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  And if you would now give us your names. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">The name you had a birth, the name you took on during the war, and the name -- and your married name.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  First I have to start with a joke. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My late parents called my Manya. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">First -- in the first grade I learned my name is Amalie when my teacher called out Amalie Petrenka to give me my report card. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">So this is the first time I learned that my name 1s Amalie, on -- and not Manya. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">When I started as a Christian Pole -- masquerading as a Christian Pole, I chose actually, my fictitious name, Felitsia Mewashefsky. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I took Felitsia from Latin, Felitsia Felitsitakislak. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">Mewashefsky ma -- was my beloved writer, I liked her booked. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">So I dec -- and also, I had a German French r. When I was masquerading, I had to blend -- almost hundred percent the local population, to the Slavic r. So naturally, I tried to eliminate r from any possible word that I can -- that I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Otherwise, probably, I would have remained Petrenka, because Petrenka is not a Jewish name. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But, I have chosen Mewashefsky. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I stayed with minash -- Mewashefsky till I got married to Norman s -- actually Naftali Salishitz at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">So I became Amalie Salishitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">When we came to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , he changed his name Salishitz to Salsitz, because his oldest brother, who was here for 20 years, at -- before m-my husband -- after my husband was born. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So he wanted to have the same family name so he beca -- I became Amalie Salsitz.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">QUESTION:  Let me ask you this, before we then go onto the duration. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">Who was Amalie Petrenka? </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Who was she as a girl, as a young person, and who was Felitsia Mewashefsky as a person? </span><span class="sentence" id="19">How did you feel about the change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Fala -- ama -- Amalie Petrenka was a very happy go lucky type, with shiny eyes that I didn’t know, but they were pointed out to me constantly, even during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">I couldn’t carry for a long time, a grudge, or hatred. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I loved people, but Amalie Salsitz was also fighter, because she was the middle child, so she fought for her rights, because my older sister was only year and a half older than I, and the younger, one year younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And my parents wanted always to keep me with my younger sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So I learned to fight for my rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And, little mischievous, rebellious, this was Amalie Petrenka. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">As matter of fact, I have done things to big displeasure of my parents, because sometimes I questioned their judgment. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">For example, I come from middle or above class, and I got -- we -- private schooling, very expensive. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So, when my parents complained about it, and they said for this money they could have traveled in Europe, I dared to tell them I didn’t ask to be born. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">This is not something in Europe, that parents appreciate. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Felitsia Mewashefsky became a very cautious person that -- full of fear, and she played th -- la -- a -- helhole lak reeda payatso. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Laughing during the day with people, the pillow all wet during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And afraid to face people, still she was exposed every time to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Many times I walked with downcast eyes, although as a child I was told, supposedly, I have very beautiful eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I used to have very big one, and dark -- the eyelight -- eye white were even blue with the fair complexion and the fair hair, I guess 1t was outstanding, and the shiny eyes, like somebody who drinks. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Here, I was downcast because I was afraid that people will recognize me. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So, predominant factor in me was cautiousness, afraid, fearful, and in a way, also I decided I will fight Hitler with [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I will prove to him that it is all really nothing, that it’s not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I will excel so much, even as a Christian Pole, and be admired, to prove how false his theory was, which I succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Many cases later -- maybe I will tell it 1-1f you want, later. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So this was the Amalie. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Still, this Felitsia Mewashefsky, if she could -- she c -- just couldn’t forget about the cultural life. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Actually it was taboo to -- for Poles -- Christians, to go to <span class="BUILDING">movie houses</span> , to go to <span class="BUILDING">resort</span> , but Felitsia Mewashefsky was able to g -- venture to <span class="BUILDING">movie houses</span> , no feedeutsch, no -- because I thought I’Il be less caught there. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And I went -- for example, I have done things, like I went to the copanna, which was forbidden for Poles, just to prove my point. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">I felt also, I play with fire later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">If so, let me be caught to -- not only because I w -- am Jewish, but I have done things that even the Poles were not permitted, the Christians.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  We will speak later about all three of you, but especially who Amalie Salsitz became in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but for the time being, let’s talk -- let’s go back a -- or stay with the time just before liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">What was your state of mind, and what were the events that followed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  Just few months before the liberation, were this first German evacuation. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Was a very trying time for me because one part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was liberated half year before I was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">I was tempted to run over to the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> , or the Russian -- o-or the la -- Jeshuf townoof, and to shorten my time of expectation, meantime I could have been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">But then I decided it’s very risky, even to run to the Russian tine, so I will endure, and take my chances to legal -- to be liberated here, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , where I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And also, I was offered, and requested, by my two companies, the first company vi -- m -- batonin -- isen bentongbal by Wilhelm Langert from Swekow saxon, to evacuate with him and his company. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">I refused on the grounds that I don’t want to leave my <span class="REGION">motherland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And the same thing, first I was also requested to evacuate with the second company, Myrader and Krauss, the Viennese company, to evacute -- or evacuate with them to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and also I refused on the grounds that I don’t want to leave my <span class="REGION">motherland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I felt, why to endanger on my life now, towards the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I didn’t expect the terrible anti-Semitism which was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So I decided not to take any chances, but to stay put in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">But nights, I always was contemplating if -- what should I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="59">What is the right thing to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">To run to the Russian oc -- and now conquered, <span class="REGION">liberated territories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">And one thing, I don’t know if it’s important. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Well, I -- I learned that I’m a little psychic. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">My dreams towards the end of the war were that I meet friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Some friends embraced me, kissed me, were very happy to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">My dearest friend, my childhood swee -- Julia Logbel, she pushed me away from her all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I couldn’t understand this, this was in my dreams. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">After the war, I found out that the people who pushed me away, like Alec Lamenstor, for example, my boyfriend who wanted -- we became fiancé, he pushed me away, they were all killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">People that didn’t survive pushed me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And people who survived, even that there was not so closed, and I didn’t think about them, survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And I met them after the war, and then I told them, “I knew you were alive, because you aka -- embraced me, you greeted me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So, this was the situation, and --
QUESTION:  Did you -- did you feel at the time when you dreamt it, did you interpret it then as a rejection, or did you interpret it as --
ANSWER:  No, at first rejection. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I cried, I -- I felt very badly, and I used to say, “I didn’t do anything wrong, why do you push me away?” </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Like my best friend -- no, I didn’t rationalize, only later, when I met, then I understood that this was the reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So this is just before the liberation, and naturally I had to be double cautious. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">One way it was easier for me, because according to my assumed things, and false papers, because I was born supposedly in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> , I was safer, because if I was caught na -- in -- in this period, first thing they checked with the parish and police. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">The parish was already in the Russian hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And, on the police, I had a legitimate cancarte made out on the fa -- a-assumed name, but they didn’t know it, and the s -- false baptismal paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So I was safer in this respect, but still I had to be very, very careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I had many incidents. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Like after Myrader and hama -- this beton [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I -- after they evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So I was referred to organization Torte, which built the -- you know, [inaudible] th -- they built -- to protect, you know, <span class="DLF">ditches</span> , <span class="DLF">ditches</span> , to protect the armies, and to slow down the onslaught of the approaching enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And my boss wanted me to evacuate with them, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I refused. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">But there was one employee, an a-accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He himself looked Jewish too, German, ricedeutsch. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And he said to me, “Fraulein Felitsia, what do you celebrate, Sabbat?” </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I knew he recognized me, naturally I play dumb. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Was still very dangerous period for me, very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I -- another one -- when -- in the new company, a Ukrainian, who worked in the bookkeeping department, turned to another white Russian, and he said to him, “You know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I suspect that Felitsia Mewashefsky is a Jewess.” </span><span class="sentence" id="93">And he spoke it in front of the women with whom I lived, who was the daughter -- daughter-in-law of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where the company was located. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And the yow -- white Russian said, “Why do you go for her life? </span><span class="sentence" id="95">What did she do to you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="96">So there were some decent people, but still was very dangerous to the last moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  And then, in a very unexpected way, you met your husband to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">What -- what happened that -- that day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  You see, when I was the secretary of the company, Myrader am-and Krauss, my boss, Klammenchitch, who happens be -- was a -- a Yugoslavian German, married to the daughter of the owner of the Myrader Krauss do -- Myrader’s daughter, and he -- when they were supposed to evacuate and I didn’t -- I refused to join them, he came over to me, and he said, “Listen, those are the keys from the safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">We will be back about two thr -- three months. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Meanti -- you will manage the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and you’ll pay out the checks.” </span><span class="sentence" id="102">He gave me the checks. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Then he told me, “You will get some very important telephone call, and cooperate.” </span><span class="sentence" id="104">But didn’t explain what will be the phone call, from whom. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Just after I think two or three days, I’m not exact -- so sure now, I got a phone call from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ’s commandanten, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow military camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And he ha -- just identify if this is the company Myrader and Krauss. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">I said yavolt. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And the command came, “Springen sie de zoilen.” </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Now, the -- I didn’t know anything about zoilen. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">I know -- knew only that my co- the company built <span class="INT_SPACE">bunkers</span> a-around big <span class="BUILDING">office building</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">German office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">And I didn’t know -- I saw the pyramids like form on the main <span class="DLF">thoroughfares</span> , but I was not -- I-I-I -- informed, and I didn’t know that this is the company our built, and those are the zoilen, but I connected immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Now, I had to think very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Had I been a German, I would have told them that they must do it themselves because my company evacuated. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And then I said, “I can save this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> being ruined.” </span><span class="sentence" id="115">A-And -- not that -- a-after all, itis a historic sto -- <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , but not that all -- all in the Poles, that they helped me to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">But still, it is the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where I lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And I was thinking also for -- I analyzed the danger what will be for me, not to tell them to do themselves, and being I was not the only one left in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">There was -- still was the lady Lydia Lu-Lublevska, the daughter-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">There was -- still was maintenance men, two chambermaids, and hi -- they didn’t ask me who was speaking, so I thought I am not endangering my life, because I can always deny receiving the phone call.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  I just want to say for our listeners that the Swengsvi zoilen, the translation is dynamite the columns.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">ANSWER:  Detonate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Detonate the columns.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  And so, after a few days, three man came, three knocked ma -- ma -- m --at the gate of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where ma -- [indecipherable] where the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was, and I told to the m- maintenance man, I told him, “Listen, now be a terrible, unstable situation, very dangerous, because this is now a German section, <span class="BUILDING">German building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">People may want to come to plunder. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">They wouldn’t know to kill, but definitely to plunder. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Don’t open the <span class="DLF">iron gate</span> till I will let you know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="127">So when the three officers came, we -- I saw them through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , I told him not to open. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And they knocked -- then they came again. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">When they came again, among them was one officer who looked like a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">So I said from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">quarter</span> cannot be any danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">So I will find out what they want, and I will explain what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So I told the man to open the <span class="DLF">gate</span> , he let them in, they came to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and among them was my present husband Norman Salsitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Norman was in -- wi -- in a leather coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Norman looks very Slavic. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And after they checked who we are, they dwelt on me, they stop with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And my husband started, a very nasty in -- interrogation. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Finally, I got very mad. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Who I am, I show the ID, it’s impossible that I am Felitsia Mewashefsky, a Pole, to be a such sensitive job, that I’m lying. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So I said, “If -- so take me to your superiors.” </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So he told me, “I am the superior.” </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And thr-threatened me, and to frighten me, he a -- opened his coat where the -- his gun was there, a revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And I said, “For God sake, it’s towards the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I don’t have to take anything from such a anti-Semite.” </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I got annoyed, and I called the officer who looked Jewish to the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that I want to talk to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">In the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> when we came, he se -- asked me, “Well, who are you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I said, “I’m Jewish, I am the same that you are.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="147">How do you know?” </span><span class="sentence" id="148">I said, “Look at your face.” </span><span class="sentence" id="149">You know, this the saying in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So, “From where are you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I said, “From Saint Swabof, from where are you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="152">He said, “I am from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I said, “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , we had many refugees during the Russian occupation, and one of them I befriended was in my <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gimnasium</span> , by the name Oskar Margolies.” </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Lo and behold, this Oskar Margolies was his first cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">From all the people in the world, what an accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Ver -- very emotion from Miskey. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Naturally, he ask about his fate, and then we went in. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">He came over to Norman, and told him to leave me alone, that I’m okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And he whispered that I am Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Norman didn’t believe till he started interrogo-gated me -- interrogating me again, because he knew this Yamen Miskey to be a womanizer, he thought, God knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And he -- he sta -- th-then somehow, in back of his mind, he said maybe, maybe she 1s Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And it was very danger -- the situation was not stable to reveal that I am Jewish, because in case the Russians retreat, the Germans come, then they -- I’m exposed as a Jew, and they kill me. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Oo -- iha -- 1t happened many times. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So this is one, he decided to be more careful. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">He ask if I s -- speak other languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I said yes. “</span><span class="sentence" id="167">What?” </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I said, “Russian, German,” and I couldn’t say Hebrew, because I was afraid they will understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So he switch to his broken English, as little as he knew, what nationality I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I said I am Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">He didn’t believe, so he started again about Jewish religion, and -- and custom, and then he asked me [inaudible] about the very sacred day in our Jewish life, Yom Kippur, the big atonement day that every Jew knows, and he asked me what we say on Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">When he asked me this question, only a Jew kn- knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Then I knew that he is Jewish, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I answered immediately Yom Kippur, then, with tears from my eyes I said, “You too? </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You too Jewish?” </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And this is how we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">So then we -- but, because we [indecipherable] he sa -- I told him I speak Hebrew too, and I called him names in Hebrew, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">So he thought being I’m young, that the Germans taught me Hebrew in order I should spy on Jews and give them out -- not that I am Jewish, because they have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">So they taught me Hebrew so perfect 1n order to fish out the poor Jews who were masquerading as Gentile. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So then we switched to Polish, and then he stated the reason why he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And s -- th -- I said, “Why didn’t you tell me right away? </span><span class="sentence" id="182">Why did I have to go through such interrogation, and you know it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="183">I was so aggravated. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And so I took him to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> across, because the -- those were the <span class="INT_SPACE">living quarters</span> , I took him to -- across the <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and I gave him the plans of the <span class="DLF">pyramids</span> , of the columns that were erected, because there was a master plan, so they didn’t -- they could deton -- detonate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And this 1s how I met Norman. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Started with hate. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">He actually came to kill me, and as matter of fact, they were discussing who is the one who will kill me, because they were afraid after I give the plans I can get in touch with the ca -- m-military commandant, and tell them already that they have the plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">A-And even my husband felt badly because it came upon him to kill, and he felt he never killed a woman, even if she’s German, even all his sisters were killed by the Germans, all his gra- nieces and nephews, but still he couldn’t bring himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So this is the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">From hatred, for wanted to

<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  One way, again, I decided I have to survive, to bear witness, in spite of Hitler’s theory, but when I found myself liberated, and you couldn’t stop and question, where are my loved ones? </span><span class="sentence" id="252">You couldn’t accept it. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Why I? </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Why not my sister, the lovely Celia, 17 ye -- years co -- killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Why not my beautiful mother, 41 years old? </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Why not my father, 45 years old? </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Not speaking about my cousins, uncles, and not speaking of my dear friends, my childhood friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">So it -- it was a mixed feeling, one laced with like guilt, why I -- why was I chosen? </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And then, naturally, relief, that finally it’s over, and I can be a free person, and I can do, and -- and not -- threat of death, the Damocles sword over my head, that was for me since ’4] till ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">But it was not the real joy, not like that you would accomplished something very big, because the price you pay for it.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  My only stand -- I mentioned was the knowledge that I still have family in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">So naturally, the choice was I have to be reunited with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">But, when it was proven, when we escaped from -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and because of the policy of Great Britain, was not permitted to immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , I didn’t want to risk again, and to be caught - sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Cyprus</span> , a-and God knows for how long, and then to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So I felt all <span class="DLF">roads</span> are leading to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">Doesn’t matter which I take. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Being that Jews had an opportunity to - under joint certific -- group certificate to immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , I decided to take what comes first, and then I will go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">What I have done. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Now, to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> is a story I must tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">We know we cannot stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Each face I scrutinized, I couldn’t look -- and it was a terrible emotional -- terrible emotional for me, because everyone I looked, is this the killer? </span><span class="sentence" id="272">Is this the killer of my parents, my family, my sister, my beloved ones? </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Oh, we knew we cannot stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">We tried to make it as brief as possible, but in order to immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , we needed papers to get visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Ironically, the Germans who applied had all the papers, they didn’t have any difficulties, and they were processed very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">We survivors, who didn’t have any papers, or the one who survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Or like I, who had to leave everything, any scrap of paper which will identify me, and be under assumed, I didn’t, so we couldn’t be processed, we couldn’t be -- get -- obtain a visa. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So finally, my husband and I, we decided to approach the general council, explain the situation, what it 1s, and that something must be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Some Jews bribed the secretary -- again, who was the secretary?

had never been -- and, like I said, I never thought after liberation that I will be in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So we stayed with him for a

</span><span class="sentence" id="358">With broken English he asked us who are we, and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And we told him that we are survivors, refugees, and we are looking

<p><span class="sentence" id="611">ANSWER:  No comparison. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Here I am among mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I am not a minority. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">Do you n -- I -- no one who didn’t go through it doesn’t understand the feeling to be a minority, and be picked, always sacrificial lamb for anything goes wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">Here I among -- I’m e-equal to others. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">And this such a wonderful feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">I -- and so proud, and especially I was privileged to watch the development of this <span class="REGION">county</span> since ’49. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">At least every two years we were there, from the very hard times, economically how the <span class="REGION">county</span> built up, and physically from the desert how <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> flourished and built up. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And how people really, also, were able to live differently, and the culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">One thing is always very nice, high standard, how people were informed, well-read, and in the pleasure to discuss with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">And there’s a pride, pride to be among people equal -- intellectual people, very bright people. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">Even they are algart. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">But this is the thing, the characteristic of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And -- and pushy, because otherwise they wouldn’t survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">But you accept it, but you are proud what you see, what they achieved. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">And anybody tries to downtrod, even when the state was proclaimed, you know, the American wanted to actually is -- dissolve it, and to say <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> stop, you know, to exist, you know, because of the Arabs. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">And oil, do -- we surrounded with Arabs, always the danger. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">They wanted to throw, and still want to throw it to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">So there is a feeling -- I feel responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I remember when the Six Day War was, how I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">I wanted to bring all the children, because of security. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">I was afraid, so many armies, what will happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="633">They will squash, they will kill. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">So I had wanted to save the children at least, but thank God, it was very successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Then the Yom Kippur War, I lived through it, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I share the fate of the Israelis. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Every election, every news. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">It’s very important to me, the security of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">QUESTION:  How do you feel then, and that is the last question, but 1t’s an important [indecipherable] how do you feel then about right now the situation, what with the peace negotiations, they -- the direction taken?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  Iam not happy because I don’t trust. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">I believe what Arafat said, what he says to the Arabs. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">It’s a piecemeal. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">He wants part, whatever he can get it, without the war, then he will be strong, and he feels he -- he wants really, to erase this -- the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="644">He will do a favor, he will permit some Jews to stay, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And this scares me, very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">And the pressure from the world, in order to appease this oil, the Arab oil, the Saudi oil, the pressure they put on <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to make concessions, when they know that the concessions endanger the security of the <span class="REGION">land</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I am very unhappy about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">QUESTION:  Let’s go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> then, and let me ask you this. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">Do you remember -- not the moment, of course, but -- but sort of the time when you began to feel comfortable with your identity as Americans, and what did that mean to you, to be American?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="650">ANSWER:  Who doesn’t like to have a rich father, who doesn’t like to be from something very successful like <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And not always I’m so proud, because I am still critical. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I lo -- don’t like the bully. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">I am very unhappy now with the situation with <span class="COUNTRY">Kosovo</span> , not that [indecipherable] had to be stopped, but definitely not by bombs, not by breaking sovanti of a <span class="REGION">county</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I don’t like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And I’m afraid it may backfire, because now this is the biggest, strongest bully in the world, and if the Russians are pushed too hard -- they don’t have the means now, but they still have atom -- nuclear, and if they are pushed too much, and knowing the Russians, they will never forgive it -- <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , how it was treated. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">Now, with NATO, and entering s -- <span class="COUNTRY">Yugoslavia</span> , Serbs, and everything, I am afraid that may backfire. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">I learned history repeats himse -- itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Look the Roman empire, Hellenistic empire, <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , the big ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">They reach the peak, and then it goes down. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I will not live to see, and I hope my children and grandchildren will not live, but unfortunately, this is how history is. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">And we shouldn’t pay for the mistakes we making. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Hurts me that we Americans are not to like around the world, because we bully everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">This hurts me, because really, it’s the only democracy, not the best, but is the best comparing to others, and the opportunities and the freedom, it gives everybody, according to abilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">The only thing really what a newcomer cannot be is a president. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">But take Kissinger, take others. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">If you’re just capable -- take us. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">After all, with no help from anybody, we are very comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">All the <span class="DLF">doors</span> -- I must say almost all the <span class="DLF">doors</span> were open to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Okay, my was Jewish education, my husband was self-employed. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">No <span class="DLF">doors</span> closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I see my son-in-law, brilliant, he was accepted to <span

class="sentence" id="673">She could have been the biggest one if she wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> are open, according to your ability. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">It’s -- now they start little bit a quota, but it wasn’t a quo -- when I came was still the quota, Norman’s nephew was a quota, because then, when he wanted to go, I remember, he was accepted to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> , and there was a quota, but no more. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Now they start little bit, but it’s very high position, I am very proud again, how many Jews achieved very high positions now. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">They couldn’t before. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And so I am proud that -- watching the progress. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I’m proud that I am a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> which is not controlled by the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , and this why I wi -- we selected to come here, not to <span class="REGION">Latin America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Why I mentioned la -- <span class="REGION">South America</span> , because argen- <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> was my bro -- father’s brother, who immigrated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanislawow</span> in ’28, and he was quite well off, established. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Unfortunately, when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , a year later he died, age 45 on cancer of stomach. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">But he wanted to bring us over to <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> , and I said, “Nevermore I go to a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , especially a Catholic country, and controlled by the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And thank God, here is the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , if I don’t like I can speak up. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And if anybody tells me -- like, I had the neighbor here, German descendent, Mr. Spiegel, Charlie. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">And once our dogs had fight when I had the dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">He said, “You Jew, you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And I said, “You German, go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="688">So everybody came from someplace, doesn’t matter if you was born here. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">The only really Americans are the Indians, so it’s a wonderful feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">You’re not afraid to speak up. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">And if somebody insults you, you’re just free to fight back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">QUESTION:  I have a few other questions, but it seems to be the moment to ask you -- we had talked about Amalie Petrenka in the beginning, who she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">We had talked about Felitsia Mewashefsky. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">Now we are talking who is Amalie Salsitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Is that who you are then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">The only question I have to know, Amalie Salsitz, now presently a old woman, who retired, who lives just to -- for pleasant things, to -- as much as she can take out of life, or the Amalie who came, because of there’s a big difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">The one who arrived had to est -- had to establish herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Without no help from anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">So she had to be ageressive. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">She felt satify -- satisfied, accomplished, because in her profession she was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">As a mother having a daughter, a good daughter, the relationship was nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">There was some, like daughter mother missed, but straight in the time of the drugs, my daughter was not. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">She was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , age 17, she graduated earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">She became a lawyer. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">I’m happy, successful, and there’s respect. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I am not a very active person. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">I love -- ?</span><span class="sentence" id="709">ma very private person, luckily, because Norman has to be at every organization, at every meeting, but not only to be a member -- a member, a paid member I am also. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">B’Nai Brith, Hadassah, Sisterhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">But I don’t -- I come very seldom, unless it’s something very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">Otherwise I prefer my privacy, my book I enjoy immensely, I lose myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">I like the privacy, also maybe -- maybe there’s the reaction to the war time, when I didn’t have a private corner where I could be myself, and I realized this is why I’m such need of privacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">Like so many, especially women, like to dine in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> , and this is the biggest thing, go away for a weekend. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I like my meals when I cook, not that I am such a good cook, and not that I love to cook. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">But I have my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Because during the war again, I only had eat with the ration card, masquerading as a Gentile. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">In the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , bring the potato in the <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> , and I longed for a cook -- home-cooked meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">I remember when my landlady was making her soup, the aroma, the fragrance, and I ask, my goodness, will it be time when I will be able to make my own soup, my own tea? </span><span class="sentence" id="720">This probably shaped me. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">So till now, like I said, I like the privacy. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I like people very much, but I’m as happy when I’m by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">It’s not that I have to be beneath. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Again, like Norman functions the best, he’s a ham when there’s a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">When he doesn’t have a big group, at least four people listeners, he likes to sulk little bit, and sul -- and really y-you wouldn’t believe the joker, the storyteller than can be so quiet, that <span class="BUILDING">home</span> you have to pry out from him a sentence. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">But most comedians are that way, I heard from other women too, that they’re so good when they entertain, but <span class="BUILDING">home</span> they don’t open their mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">So -- and -- but I am content. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I love to be with my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Naturally, with my daughter means the whole world to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">My grandsons. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And even I have relationship from the beginning with my cousin Petrenka. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">He 1s now 70, and he’s a year and a half older than Iam. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">As much as we can, we spend holidays together -- together. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">It’s harder to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">And also with my friends still from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I’m still in touch, whoever is alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">They moved now, many of them to <span class="REGION">Florida</span> , because they’re old. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Some are older. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">One -- one is 89, wa -- or 80. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I have only my friend, to -- two that are my age. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">Mostly they were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , they were married. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">But we in touch, and again, it’s like family. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And on the phone, I -- I don’t like to call too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I told -- I think I mentioned to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">I don’t have the patience to talk too much on the phone, but I will call to check how they are doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I like celebrations. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">You know, at to -- attend when sp -- especially from family. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">It means a lot to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Like se -- Thanksgiving, on my daughter, or my cousin Leo Petrenka’s daughter, she makes it, Joyce, in her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , means a lot to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I don’t like big gatherings when the people are strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Like my daughter ha -- Norman likes a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And when we go there for Passover, she has at least 32 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">So it means -- we are only by seven family, the rest are friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">I don’t mind close friends, 15 people, but the friends bring -- but she invites with their parents, total strangers. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">And I feel a celebration of holiday, I want with close people. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">So I stopped going, and I gave a ultimatum. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">All you make for family. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">I’d rather go to Joyce here in <span class="REGION">Long Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I don’t want to come holiday and meet a lot of strange people. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And this is how to celebrate. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">But remarkably, and astonishly, I read in the Jewlson Post that the survivors as in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , was an article complain about the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">When they go to celebrate family with family, there is no family, because so many, and they are not too com -- not comfortable, but not so happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">They want the warmth. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">We are missing, lacking the warmth, family warmth. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">And --

<p><span class="sentence" id="883">ANSWER:  Yeah, I wanted to elaborate. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">Like I mentioned before, we Jews remember our benefactors, and remember our killers. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Now we -- ma -- Norman was in touch with a Polish woman, Stashka, who was helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">She didn’t save him -- his life, but she was helpful, and in the way -- some ways, endangered her life, because for harboring a Jew, or helping a Jew -- not helping, but harboring a Jew, she could be -- have been killed together with the -- Norman. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">And the other woman, who took me in, my f-father’s partner’s wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">I search for her, but I had the wrong address, I couldn’t find her. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">Till finally, 11 years ago, a friend of Norman, a Pole, located her. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">So we sent invitation -- at that time she was already 76 years old, and we invited both of them to <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> as our guests. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">They were here for three weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">They were honored, they got -- we live in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span> , they got, from the <span class="BUILDING">city hall</span> ,

whitesafe, they ga -- they were invited to ADL. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">They -- we spoke there. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">The <span class="BUILDING">Polish consulate</span> was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">We have even the tapes from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And naturally we took them sightseeing, and they met my daughter, and nis -- to old -- Mrs. Eezhaniecekov, the older one who helped me, said to me, “You stayed in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> three weeks, I stayed in you, now we even.” </span><span class="sentence" id="898">I said, “No, we are not even. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">You harboring me endangered your life, and the life of your whole family by keeping me. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">I invite you, normal times, materially it didn’t matter, I have the facilities, and um -- I just hosted you as a friend, without any fear of repercussion. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">So we are not even. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I still am in debt to you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And then, also a -- I would like to tell that after the war, when we met and we got married, we got married under our real name, but not officially. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">We had the reception, people we didn’t know -- the only one that we knew, it was my boyfriend -- my late boyfriend’s sister Sasha. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">The rest we didn’t know the people, big officials, and big -- 1n our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="906">So Norman and I, we promised ourselves, if we will live to age to be able to celebrate the 50" anniversary, we may -- will make it like a wedding, and thank God we able to fulfill our dream, our wish, and four years ago, I made -- we made a big -- for 120 people, a reception. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Like a wedding, except that the -- we didn’t exchange the vows, the -- and my sister came from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , Babka. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">My cousin, first cousin from <span class="COUNTRY">Argentina</span> came with her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">My cousin from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Toronto</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> came. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">My family from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dallas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="911">Not -- not only my daughter from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , from all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">This meant so much for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">The warmth, the firs time. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And the speeches were just beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">Again, I missed my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">My parents I understood, they wouldn’t have lived, normally, to be able to participate in our party. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">But my sister was only 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">She would have been 72 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">She probably would have been a grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And I missed her, and her family that she never had. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">But it was a very big affair, and I was -- it -- and also the survivor’s friends, came, who ard. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">So at least there was a celebration. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">But like any other celebration -- on my daughter’s wedding, too, was a- being she’s a only child, it was done in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Short Hills</span> , which 1-1s here in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , exquisite <span class="NPIP">place</span> , beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">But when I walked to the <span class="DLF">aisle</span> with my husband, I didn’t have tears from joy, only missing my parents, who couldn’t be at the wedding. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">So, on every happy occasion, there’s this sadness, that lo -- that -- the loss of the dear ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Naturally, also, my sister came from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> with her late husband, but still, the other sister wasn’t -- the -- that she could have been -- at that time my parents could be still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">So no celebration ha -- is -- it sure is supposed to be a hundred percent happy, it’s never. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Also, because outwardly, we live a normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I can’t complain. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">We were quite successful in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> in many respects. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Acknowledged, respected in our community, in our <span class="BUILDING">Temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="933">We publish a lot, we known people. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Say as much as we can, we quite charitable, we known. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">But during the night, where we cannot control our thoughts, the dreams are still terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">We are still chased, are still killed, and we caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">And this is when one awakes the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">One spouse -- or my husband e -- or I -- my husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Because we screaming still. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">But I guess this will be till the day till we die. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">People thought we -- we thought that with time there wouldn’t be bleeding so much, but it’s not true. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">It was with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">So we will ask, can we ever forgive, and forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And I tell, I cannot forget. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">I don’t have any right to forgive, because the victims are not there to forgive. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">I’m still alive, but they are not there, so I don’t have the right to forgive. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">People ask me if I’m religious, if I believe in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I say, I observe, I’m not so religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">Iv -- but I believe in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">I cannot prove that there is not a God. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">In moments of distress, I will still turn to God. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">But I cannot say that I love Him. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">I cannot say that I hate Him, but I don’t love Him. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I still questioning, where was He, that He permitted such atrocities. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">If I found peace, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">I cannot. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">Not because nor -- I -- I can sed -- I can generalize, in <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , we didn’t get any help how to cope. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">First we were immersed in life, to establish us, as we are busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">So the days were easier. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">But in -- older we get, and now when we -- I am retired, my husband’s semi- retired, it’s still so fresh, and so painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">And we try to reason, doesn’t work. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">And also by association. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">We traveled extensively, except I must -- I shouldn’t brag, except <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> , we were all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">When I saw in <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> children led by teacher, I didn’t see Jewish children led by teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">I saw that the children left to the <span class="DLF">Umshlaktplatz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Dr. Kolchuk’s children. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">There were times in the beginning, not now any more, when I was in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> with a lot of people, especially when there was commemoration of the Holocaust, few thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">I was always afraid to -- that there will be --a bomb will be thrown in, or fire, because I remember some of my friend’s family were put in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and let -- and burned to -- the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , bur - and burn in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="969">I was afraid of gatherings. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">And many times when I see -- when I saw a dogcatcher, I associated it with the chasings, and catching the Jews, hunting for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">I remember my neighbor had a lot of cats, so the see -- SPS called her, told her to put cages. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And when I saw it, I started to cry, I said, “Open it, I cannot see it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Because when I -- me -- I -- we -- we caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Till now, when I see <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , picture [indecipherable] how my dear one were caught in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">See my mother was not sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , nor my father, we didn’t have any in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stanislawow</span> , when we were under -- because we were under the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">The Germans had excuse for the war that we are all Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And they just killed us in <span class="DLF">ditches</span> , the -- dug in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , on <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> , we saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">One different excuse, different, supposedly reason, every time. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">So you see, this -- you cannot erase something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">It stays with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And the same thing with food, when I give, till now I cannot face food, because I remember the times we starved, and moi -- my poor daughter said -- she was quite chubby one ch-child, because she said, “You always reminded me how we -- you starved, and the children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> starved, and you always make me eat,” which is true. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">I cannot, because -- so there are many things that shaped me, remained with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">Again, Imelda has a lot of shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">I stuff too. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Not as many as she has, and clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">In case I cannot buy because I didn’t have, and the same with food. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">And my daughter with food also. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">She’ll buy a lot she doesn’t eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">God forbid that something should happen, her children shouldn’t

<p><span class="sentence" id="992">ANSWER:  I always like Passover, Easter, always. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">High holidays I celebrate, but it’s hard for me, because there’s a lot of prayers for dead, for killing, and very hard, but I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">But then again I recall how it was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , how I used to come to my mother, because we girls didn’t attend <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> like it -- Christians, or an American girls go. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">We used to bring just perfume, because we used to feast -- no fast, not feast, not to eat, so naturally, salts, and [indecipherable] to revive. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">I -- so I remember it vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">So it’s hard, it’s hard.</span></p>
