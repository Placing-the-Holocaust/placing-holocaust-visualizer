<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  And we -- there -- there were massive records in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Offenbach</span> , which was about eight kilometers from -- from the heart of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">My first <span class="BUILDING">office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> was in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">Reichsbank branch</span> , which is like the <span class="BUILDING">Federal Reserve bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="483">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> that <span class="BUILDING">building</span> is still there, and of course the great luxury that I acquired and from which I didn’t want to part was a -- was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rocking chair</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">After -- after a couple of years of army service in a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> in other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rocking chair</span> was something special anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">But that is what we did for several months, and that was also during the period when the Soviets, as you know, would not let the American forces into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Although officially, according to the Alta agreement, we were supposed to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> practically from the beginning, the Soviets needed a couple of months to -- to loot, rape and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And -- and so I wer -- I worked out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> until the beginning of January, by which time already the military governor of -- was -- our military governor was -- was already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">His name was General Lucius Clay. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And all the other military governors were sitting there, and there was, at that time still that instrument which was supposed to be the coordinating instrument, using the Russian term kommandatura, spelled with a K, and that had to be -- that was part of our of-official vocabulary, and -- and I was then directed to move from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and I moved there in January of 1946. </span><span class="sentence" id="490"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was in a shambles, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">It was a very cold winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">The U.S. army did some lovely things for the civilian population. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">Had <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> on <span class="DLF">crossings</span> and little islands with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army potbelly stoves</span> that were going all the time so people could go in and warm their hands, which I thought was -- was proper humane thing to do and -- and -- and we did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">In any event, I was then assigned to the Intelligence division of the finance department, and my first assignment involved the writing of a report on the largest of the <span class="BUILDING">German banks</span> , which was called the Deutsche bank. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">The Germans had three major <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">They were called the gross bank and the giant <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> , that was the official German terminology. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">And that was the <span class="BUILDING">Deutsche bank</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Dresdner bank</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">Commerce bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Deutsche is deutsche in German and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresdner</span> is based on the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dresden</span> , and Commerce is commerce. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">And they were in -- in that order in the size, and of course once we -- we got into their -- their records and -- and we interrogated a lot of people, and the picture was very clear, they -- they -- the first step was the -- the [indecipherable] of the banking system, ri -- right after January 30, 1933 when Hitler came to power, started the removal of -- of Jews from leading positions in the banking system, both in the -- in the board of directors, which was called the [indecipherable] and the board of management, which 1s called the Vorstand. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">In this way, by the way, is -- 1s with a V, written as a V and pronounced as a V.

They removed the Jews, there were -- there were prominent Jews as bankers, and prominent Jews on -- on the boards of directors and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">That was the first step of elimination. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Then the <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> proceeded to Aryanize, to take over control of -- of many of the <span class="BUILDING">private banks</span> which were Jewish owned. </span><span class="sentence" id="503"><span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> had a -- a -- a whole series, starting with the Rothschild banks of course, but over the years <span class="BUILDING">private banks</span> quite well known, Mendelssohn and -- and Aufweiser and etcetera, etcetera, and Oppenheimer and so on.

<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  -- <span class="BUILDING">Czech bank</span> and so on, very systematic, very orderly. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And there was even a sort of a -- became almost like a little rhyme, it -- 1t rhymes in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">Zuerst kommen die tanken, first come the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , and then kommen die banken, and then come the <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="512">That rhymes in German, obviously, the tanken and banken rhyme. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">But it was like [indecipherable] the same thing applied to <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="514">When they moved into <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> they took the control of the major <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> , they di -- took control in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">And so the first report was the report on the activities of the <span class="BUILDING">Deutsche bank</span> , and simultaneously the <span class="BUILDING">Dresdner bank</span> w -- very -- it was a -- where they -- a special unit, and I was part of it, and somewhere along the way I -- I was given more responsibility and -- and in some of the subsequent investigations, I was the chief investigator of it and so on, and in any event, the objective of these reports was that th-the -- the military government had to establish a policy on what is -- what kind of a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> is this [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">One thing was very clear, that A, we will not allow a -- a intermingling of banking and industrial corporations, because the German system, particular the -- the Nazi period is that the major <span class="BUILDING">banks</span> ended up being the -- providing the chairmanships of the main major industrial companies. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">It was a real intertwining of interlocking directorates, it 1s called in the decartelization world. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And in addition to that, we came with a tradition of decentralized banking in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="519">In the state of New York at that time, believe it or not, <span class="BUILDING">Chase Manhattan</span> had no right to have a <span class="BUILDING">branch</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  The state of New York was divided into <span class="REGION">banking districts</span> , and if a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> and in the Manhattan district of banking, it could not be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buffalo</span> and it could not be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Syracuse</span> in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">So the whole idea of -- of extreme decentralization of banking, very important [indecipherable] anyways, but in this case it was important not to allow the reconstitution of -- of the instruments which were important instruments in the whole Nazi program of -- of -- of -- of control and -- and -- and centralization of economic power.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="554">ANSWER:  Although the State Department had a senior political officer, there was General Clay, and there was a senior State Department official as the political officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">But General Clay was here. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">And -- and then negotiations were going on for property restitution, the -- there was an organization that had to be -- the Jewish organizations properly advanced this whole issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And the major battle, and that was -- that was one of the great, basic, historic developments, which was historic in the whole international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">In the normal, civilized life, if I die tomorrow in the state of New York without heirs, the state of New York inherits me. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">You can go back to the [indecipherable] of 2,000 years plus, and you will find the principle intended for normal, civilized societies. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">The Jewish organizations came to the U.S. government and said, that is not acceptable after the extermination of six million Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">The successor -- the successor state of the Third Reich cannot become the beneficiary of the efficiency of their extermination program. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">I mean, you can go back to the -- to the old Biblical expression, you cannot mur-murder and inherit. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">And -- but that was a difficult battle, because the battle had to be th-the battle with international lawyers who said, too bad, this is ironclad concept and it cannot be a-any other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">And reparations -- remember historically, if you go back to World War I and so on, it was always an issue between states. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">The -- the victorious state could exact reparations from the -- from that state wa -- which was defeated, but it was always interstate dealings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="566">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="567">ANSWER:  Here obviously we were coming with -- the organizations were coming with demands for restitution programs to individuals, regardless of what their nationality may be at the -- at the moment that [indecipherable] had to be done, but most importantly with respect to the heir list, and unclaimed Jewish property, and to the property of Jewish communities and organizations that were obliterated by the Nazi regime, that -- that it -- 1t could not [indecipherable] is the legal expression is to this -- to the state in which the property was located. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">That took a long time and a long fight, but the Jewish organizations prevailed, and the U.S. government agreed, and the first property restitution law was enacted as a United States military government law number 59, in November of 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And in that law there is a provision which says, unclaimed property of victims of Nazi persecution as defined in the beginning of the law, shall accrue to a successor organization, which shall use the proceeds for the benefit of the class of persecutees.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">QUESTION:  Hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="571">ANSWER:  And this was a genuine revolutionary concept and development in international law. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">And it is to the everlasting credit, as far as I’m concerned, of the United States government, that stood up all by itself, because I’Il tell you in a moment for how long it stood up all by itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">The British and the French did not go along initially with this concept, and enacted this as valid for the Americans [indecipherable] of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="574">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="575">ANSWER:  There was no central government in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> until the fall of 1949. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Between °45 and ’49 there was no central government. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Every military governor was the absolute ruler of his zone of occupation and this sector of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And there were municipal governments, and there eventually were state governments, you know, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> and Hassen and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">But there was no central government until four -- for over four years. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And in November of 1947, this law was enacted in the American zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">American zone of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to give you an idea in present day -- day <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and -- and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kassel</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> as a <span class="DLF">port</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> and etcetera, I mean it -- it was sort of the center of the -- the British had th-the -- the industrial heart of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , the whole -- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cologne</span> and the <span class="DLF">coal mines</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">steel mills</span> and so on, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="582">And the French had the most <span class="REGION">western part</span> , bordering on <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alsace</span> , and -- on Alsatia and Alsace and -- and then -- and on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake area</span> and so on, and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> , the Schwarzweld and so on, they had -- they had nice <span class="REGION">countryside</span> , but that -- they, of course, were the smallest of the -- of the <span class="REGION">zones</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">When that was enacted, General Clay wanted the British and the French, his counterparts to enact a similar law -- laws for their <span class="REGION">zones</span> so there would be a single property restitution law in <span class="REGION">West Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">The Soviets you could forget about, they were not interested in private property, they were not interested in the whole concept of compensation and restitution and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">There was nothing to talk about with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">The British and the French would not go along. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">Th-This was not in their -- the military governors obviously ca -- don’t make these decisions, the decisions go back to the governments. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">And in the case of the governments, it of course goes to the <span class="BUILDING">foreign office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and to the [indecipherable] in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">The international lawyers over there said, no how. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">So General Clay went in and -- and promulgated it in the <span class="REGION">American zone</span> , and the Jewish organizations established in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> the first si -- Jewish successor organization called the Jewish Restitution Success Organization, or JRSO for short.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="591">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="592">ANSWER:  That was created almost at the same time when the law was enacted, it was in the last November of °47, but it didn’t come into real operation until the late spring of ’48 because -- and that is very difficult for us imag -- to imagine today -- you could not create from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> any kind of an operation in the occupied parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> unless you were somehow hooked up to military government. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">You couldn’t get <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> , you couldn’t get access to food, you couldn't -- you -- you could not function, ordinarily. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">So the -- the Jewish organizations, primarily the Joint Distribution Committee, which was -- had a massive operation in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> because they were running the Jewish Displaced Persons camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">My s -- first contacts with the Joint were in the spring of 1946 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , because within a month or so when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , I discovered that there was a Jewish Displaced Persons camp in the American sector of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zehlendorf</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So of course I ber -- I marched myself over to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zehlendorf</span> and I br -- and I met my JDC friends from that point on. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">And I would go to the <span class="BUILDING">army post exchange</span> and buy cartons of cigarettes at a dollar -- Camels at a dollar apiece, 10 cents a pack, and schlep it to the -- to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> because that was the currency, the reichsmark didn’t --

QUESTION:  May I call you Saul?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="631">ANSWER:  By all means.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  When -- when we were talking in between the tapes, you started to talk about the fact that you thought you were talking too much about Saul Kagan, about yourself, and not about the issue that was most important to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">So tell me what you think is the really important issue here, with respect to this interview.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="634">ANSWER:  As I see it, and it -- and you can say eventually it is subjective because of -- of my own immersion in this -- in this whole <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="635">But as I -- as I keep thinking over the years that there is one <span class="REGION">area</span> which in my judgment is that had been fully and properly researched and -- and examined, and that is what were the particular forces and elements in the -- in the lil -- late 1930’s and the early 1940’s that -- that made it possible for organized world Jewry, and I use -- I say organized because unless -- unless something is organized, unless there 1s some sort of an instrumentality, then it is a lot of conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Maybe conversation 1s important, yo-you -- you may not come to the -- to the action before -- be-before you -- before you -- you -- you contemplate the problem, but nonetheless, for the first time -- and I’m not a professional historian, so I say it with all these caveats and reservations, but I think it’s the first time where the organized Jewish community in this global sense has -- has decided, in response to -- to 1n- incredible tragedy that has befallen the Jewish people, to -- to confront the perpetrators or -- or their successors. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Because if I go back, at least to the extent which -- and I have spent obviously, time going back to -- to periods of -- of disaster and catastrophe in Jewish life, there was an event, or events of -- of persecution and of -- and of physical damaging injury and -- and murder with the survivors ultimately going into some kind of exile or into some -- away from wherever it is, leaving behind all their worldly goods, basically, and building a new life and a new existence and new communities in hope that -- that it will not be destroyed or damaged again. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And you see rip -- that repeatedly but frequently enough, whether you go back to the destructions of the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , the -- the <span class="BUILDING">temples</span> of the -- of the Babylonian period or -- or s -- or subsequently in the -- in the Middle Ages, the pogroms and the Crusaders and the period about -- which Barbara Tuchman described in -- in -- in some of her books and so on, what you saw was, the Jews picked themselves up from the <span class="REGION">area</span> where the Crusaders and so on persecuted them. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Fortunately the kings of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> wanted -- needed craftsmen, and that in -- created an open <span class="DLF">door</span> , and the Jews were moved from the <span class="REGION">Rhine area</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , etcetera and a new chapter in Jewish history opened up [indecipherable] Jewish community in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And -- and -- and then subsequently came all kinds of -- forms of persecution, some of them -- obviously 1492 in <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> , and again the Jews ran and left everything behind and build new lives and -- and those who were caught by the Inquisition of course, perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And -- and then came the whole si -- middle -- middle of 17" century with the [indecipherable] pogroms. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Again the same -- the same phenomenon. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Persecution, murder, exile, escape, flight, whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I am obviously not going into the intricacies, but [indecipherable] that -- that’s the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And -- and even as late as -- as the beginning of the 20" century, with the pogroms of [indecipherable] and what was the response there? </span><span class="sentence" id="646">The massive migration out of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to -- to -- to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">The roots of the vast majority of American Jews today are the -- the gr-grand -- the grand or gr -- or great-grandparents of those who ran from the pogroms of -- of -- of <span class="REGION">Tsarist Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">No- Nobody dug in their heels and said, we were -- we were driven out, we were hurt, we were damaged, we were persecuted. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">S-S -- this -- this government, or this successor government cannot get away with this. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Now you can say that -- that -- that the [indecipherable] and that Hitler and -- and -- and the Third Reich and the industrialized, massive, incredible industrialized persecution and -- and -- and annihilation of -- of six million people in -- in five years was so earth-shaking and [indecipherable] earth-shaking. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">Sometimes I ask myself -- I don’t know, 1s it -- was it for the days of the [indecipherable] pogroms for -- for the Jews at that time as great a horror as -- as -- as Kristallnacht? </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I-I don’t know, I can’t -- I can’t judge it. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">Or -- or -- or the [indecipherable] of a whole people out of the <span class="REGION">Iberian peninsula</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="654">I mean, that certainly was not a - a local -- a small local event of -- of some people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of [indecipherable] getting cr- crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Now, the other possibility is -- is, of course, maybe by the 1930’s, there were things around us at the world at large that -- that established some kind of precedence, in other words of- of some forms of collective response to something. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">I -- I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">The one thing that comes to mind for instance was the -- was the Armenian -- the persecution of the Armenians by the Turks in 1915, the World War I. I haven’t researched that for myself well enough to know whether there was, first of all on the part of the Armenians outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , some organized effort to attempt to confront the Turkish government with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">I’m not sure, at least I’m not aware that it was of such open and -- and strong [indecipherable] fashion as I think happened finally in- in the early 1940’s with respect to -- to -- to the human and material consequences o-of the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And that -- and that -- I mean, I share a result of -- of a layman’s perception of a feeling that something extra historically, certainly, in my opinion, in Jewish history, historically something extraordinary happened, and then so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">And even -- and e -- and it, to me it would be that even be necessarily confined to Jewish history alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">The question of a -- of a persecuted group which is not represented by a state, that does not have an army, that does not have the -- the -- the basic indices of -- of -- of power, has somehow developed first -- first -- first agreed or begin to -- to -- to find this -- this whole approach, and then -- and then ended up building, if you will, the infrastructure to -- to -- to -- to -- to carry it forward and to -- and to turn it into something tangible, for the benefit of the victims, for [indecipherable] th-the victims themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And -- and -- and that -- that has to be analyzed. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">One has to analyze the elements of American Jewish history 1-1n -- in the -- in the 19 -- in the 1930’s, in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , in -- in -- in -- in how -- in how the German Jewish community reacted. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">In what it ca -- what it carried with it when -- when it began en masse to -- to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">What is connected with it, of course, I mean I -- I’m drifting, but Pll get back on the main track, is also where were the fi -- where were the -- the failings? </span><span class="sentence" id="666">The failings being did the organized Jewish world after 1933 sufficiently analyze where the Third Reich and -- and the Nazis and Hitler were leading? </span><span class="sentence" id="667">After all, of the 600,000 German Jews, 300,000 remain in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="668">Now, again, I make a statement like that and it sounds again like an exaggeration an-and unqualified. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I realize that among the 300,000 that stayed may have been tens of thousands who would have been -- who wanted to get out and the world wouldn’t take them in, including this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="670">But nonetheless, there were large numbers of people, some of whom I’ve known among -- among German Jewry and subsequently Austrian Jewry and so on, who thought, you know, this is a passing business, and now we’re -- and now we’re -- good Germans will -- will take care of this upstart over there because in other words, where th -- I f -- I forget about the world, but where -- where did the Jewish leadership? </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And I am not trying to be ac-accusatory, I’m trying to -- to save what -- what did we f -- when I say we, I’m talking in the broad, historical [indecipherable] sense, failed to see as to where it was going. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">Now you can make the argument I ca -- I talk to myself, you know, I -- yo-you -- you can make the argument on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> to say there was no precedent for this type of -- of -- of organized massacres, although there were massacres in history. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">What follows from it? </span><span class="sentence" id="674">Had we -- had we really, collectively, deeply analyzed where this was going? </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Maybe we could have done more than we -- than we did to get people out. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">To protect, to save, to -- to -- to d -- I don’t know to do what. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So to- to me, as I -- you know, being -- being immersed into this -- I don’t know, up to the -- the tip of my head or whatever it is, or beyond it. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I -- I say to myself, this -- this has to be more profoundly examined. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I don’t know how else to [indecipherable] sometimes I am at a loss for words. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">But -- and -- and I think this is -- this is subjects for philosophers, this is subjects for ethicists, this is subjects for historians. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">The Jews -- the Jews would not be -- were not alone in this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">As a matter of fact the Jews were -- were more intertwined with the world than maybe any other people because they were -- because they were scattered and because they had to survive always as minorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">So -- so --

<p><span class="sentence" id="865">ANSWER:  Because that book is exclusively devoted to the negotiations. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">And so the -- the first formal approach by the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was to the four occupying go -- powers. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">The Soviets ignored it. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">For the British and the French it was -- but the Americans by that time said, you got to talk to Konrad Adenauer, you got to talk to the government.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="870">ANSWER:  And again to the credit of the U.S. -- at that time Clay was already gone, it was no longer a military governor, it was a United States high commissioner. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">And then -- and this terminology is- has real significance, because it was past the stage of a military government occupying, it was the follow-up of a military occupation to the -- to a representative of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> respectively negotiating with the first central West German government for the removal of all -- of all elements of occupation from the new <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="872">It was a gradual process and it found its full expression in something that was called contractual agreements. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Periodically, step by step, the western powers would negotiate with the Adenauer government. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">These prerogatives of the allies are gone, these prerogatives are gone, and we were in the middle of it, insisting and the -- and the federal government -- German federal government took it over - had to take it over, by they way I -- in all fairness to them, I don’t think they necessarily resisted it, or it has to be checked because I’m quite sure it -- that the principles of the allied -- of the American military government restitution law became German federal law.</span></p>

QUESTION:  [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  -- [indecipherable] people, there was a m -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> itself, this became a -- the most explosive issue that if -- that the Ben Gurion government, which was the first government of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> faced. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Menachem Begin led the opposition to the Ben Gurion government on all kinds of issues, and this became one of the major issues in his battle with Ben Gurion. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">The argument was when we should take th -- we should not take any blood money, and -- and the -- it -- it took the form of demonstrations, it took the form of -- of such serious demonstrations that I think for the first time in the history of the state of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , the Kenesit had to be surrounded by police, maybe by army too, but when Ben Gurion went in January of 1952 to the Kenesit to rec -- to receive a majority vote for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> entering into negotiations with <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="962">So that controversy was partially philosophical, or partially moral if you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">I mean, there were people who -- who really, out of genuine inner convictions, and there were people who -- who mixed the opposition with -- with direct political -- this was a -- a -- a very strong issue, you have to think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Th -- by that time there were several hundred thousand survivors already in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and it was a-- av --a very controversial issue, and it -- it took the form of -- as I say of -- of -- of very major demonstrations in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="965">In the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , we had one really serious episode. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">And that is, we had one day a meeting, after the original meeting in the <span class="BUILDING">Waldorf</span> , in another <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and a group of a young -- there was a youth o-organization of the -- of Begin’s party, and -- and they -- that organization was called Betar. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">This is -- today it would be the youth movement of the Likud in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , the -- the -- the -- the logical political extension of that movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">And they came into the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> where we had the meeting, and they had a -- a sit down strike. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">They sat down in the <span class="INT_SPACE">hallway</span> blocking the access -- exit and the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to my meetings, and we had to get -- after, when the meetings were over, we wanted to get Nahum Goldmann and other of the people out because you never know if you get, particularly that this was -- Betar is a- was a pretty militant group anyway, but in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> they were -- I mean, outside of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> there were f -- people ideologically, philosophically, there are people today who say they’re not going to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to visit, or I will not buy a German product and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">I mean, even today, to this day, but certainly in -- in -- in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">And it was -- it went so far, for instance, that there was one group of -- of Holocaust survivors who organized themselves generally, and those were the people who came out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , of the Bergen-Belsen camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And although the -- the chairman of their group, a man called Joseph Rosensaft was actually helpful in connection with the negotiations, his organization and these people would -- would -- they would not want -- they did not want to become members of the Claims Conference because they couldn’t bring themselves to negotiate with the Germans, regardless of who the Germans were who were negotiating partners. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">Anyway, by January of ’52, Ben Gurion got his approval of the majority of the Kenesit, the Claims Conference was ready to go, and we had internal discussions between the Claims Conference and Mr. Sharett in preparation for the negotiations. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">But that -- we were -- one thing at that time was clear, none of us would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for negotiations. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">So this -- the -- the government of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> had to find a neutral <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that was willing to host us. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And that was not so simple because it required security. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">We never knew whether neo-Nazi elements or any other elements were going to -- to cause problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">The Dutch government agreed and made available to us, a chateau. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">A <span class="BUILDING">medieval castle</span> with a <span class="DLF">moat</span> and a <span class="DLF">drawbridge</span> , literally. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">You can still see it, it’s now a <span class="BUILDING">conference center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="981">And the German delegation, headed by 20 Nazis and the Claims Conference delegation and the Israel delegation were all housed in the same chateau, in different wings and so on, in the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="982">And the negotiations were, as a rule, in the morning between the Germans and the Israelis, and in the afternoon between the Germans and the Claims Conference, and in the evenings and in between, of course, the Claims Conference, and the Israeli delegates were together, obviously together [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And there were, of course, crises, and periods when we had to interrupt the negotiations and go over there to f -- had to fly from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bonn</span> to negotiate with Adenauer on the contentious issues and to find some kind of compromise. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">This happened several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">I personally had to shuttle more frequently, because as the executive director of the Claims Conference, our negotiations policy committee was sitting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , of the top lay leadership of the Claims Conference, and I would -- and first of all the Claims Conference as an organization had to function. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">So I would sh -- spend a couple of weeks in -- in negotiations and fly back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and -- and we -- the organization go back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">But we also had periods when the negotiations were suspended because there were serious differences of opinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">The negotiations lasted from the 22" of March -- as a matter of fact, a day after tomorrow will be -- 207 -- 52 -- 55 years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="989">QUESTION:  Really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="990">ANSWER:  Exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">I ca -- didn’t think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">55 years since we landed in a separate <span class="DLF">runway</span> in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="993">We were flown in because Dutch security didn’t want us to c -- to come in with the regular business. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">So -- so they landed us on a -- on a secluded -- and packed us into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , and brought us to the Kasteel oud Wassenaar, the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> of old Wassenaar. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Had one great vir -- virtue as far as I was concerned. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">Was withi -- within the walking distance of a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> which has a fantastic Rembrandt, and that is called the <span class="BUILDING">Mauritshuis House</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a man called Mauritshuis. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">And there is “The Anatomy Lesson” by Rembrandt which 1s as big as this <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And after 12 - 14 hours, I would run a -- run away from the <span class="BUILDING">chateau</span> with a Dutch security guard who hated <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> passionately. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">Probably as a kid he must have been dragged by his hair to a <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> and I would say to him, you can sit <span class="NPIP">outside</span> and smoke your lousy cigarettes, and I'll give you a piece of paper if anything happens to me inside of the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> , it’s my responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And that -- that then, after awhile I thought that these characters from the -- from the painting will start talking to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I mean it -- this 1s a fantastic painting, it’s still there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">Anyway, and we were there with intervals for -- until the third week of August, more or less.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1003">QUESTION:  Really? </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">So long?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1005">ANSWER:  I mean, but there were intervals.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1006">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1007">ANSWER:  Sub [indecipherable] delegation had to go back and we’d come back and -- and they were very complicated issues, they were issues of -- that overlapped, because we negotiated compensation agreements which affected all victims of Nazi persecution, whether they were Israeli citizens, or American citizens, or Australian ci -- or [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">And -- and there were overlaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">The German delegation, by the way, was headed initially by two anti-Nazis, one a Professor Burn, a professor of civil law from <span class="BUILDING">Frankfurt University</span> , who I believe was -- was towards the end of the war in a <span class="BUILDING">Gestapo jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And a man called Dr. Otto Kirsten, who was a leading Protestant pol-politician o-opposing the Hitler regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">He was a lawyer in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> , and- and there was a t -- an issue a-and they were our negotiating partners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">Of course, they would receive instructions from the Adenauer government, and at times there were issues where -- where we knew that -- that they were communicating to us positions that they personally were not necessarily in favor of. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">And this was the time that we instinctually would call time out and get ahold of -- of Nahum Goldmann in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and tell him to -- and ask him to fly to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bonn</span> to negotiate with Adenauer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">And -- and Goldmann was fantastic in that respect, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">This 1 -- this was a man with a broad intellectual horizon, a broad western intellect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">Although he was born in -- in -- 1n a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in -- in what would be <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , I think, today, but his parents early went to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and he was a product of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> and I don’t know what other <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">And during World War I, believe it or not, as a very young academic, I think he worked for the -- for the Kaiser’s foreign ministry on some -- you know, routine job over there, it is -- was -- the reason I mention all this is -- is because his -- his cultural roots -- I’m talking -- I’m not talking about the Jewish cultural roots, I’m talking his general roots. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">His academic roots were, to a very great extent, similar to the -- to the people -- the policy makers of the new -- of the new German - of the new post-war <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I mean, he and Adenauer would -- would -- he would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to -- to -- to spend hours and hours with Adenauer on issues that had nothing to do with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">Va-Vacation issues, the -- whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And -- but this was a man with a -- with a very broad political, international, diplomatic talents, and a man from whom I learned a great deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">He was old enough to be my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">He was born in ’95, and I was born in ’22.</span></p>

ANSWER:  [indecipherable] put it this way first. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">Pll be very precise on this point, because I wrestled with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">There were individuals who had an inner moral, ethical, personal inability to face anything or anybody which reminded them of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Then there were politicians, who -- about whom I was not always sure where the political consideration, that this 1s a hot issue under which I can -- I can undercut my opponent, or whether there was -- this was a pure moral issue. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">So I -- I -- I di - I do -- I don’t tend to pass judgment on it, but my view is completely different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1033">QUESTION:  And what was your view?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1034">ANSWER:  My view was and 1s and always will be, we were there demanding what is rightfully ours, and we were demanding it from those who were -- who had responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">In many cases who even controlled the assets and -- and overall who had the moral, legal, historic responsibility to make amends for what their predecessor government had done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">The f-first post-war German government said very clearly and unequivocally, it is the succe -- for better or for worse, it is the successor state of the Third Reich. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">He didn’t play games like cur -- like [indecipherable]

QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1044">ANSWER:  -- exercise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">We collectively felt that A, there had to be an acknowledgement of responsibility, whether it was Konrad Adenauer’s statement, or whether it was at the time when -- when it -- the year 2000 we signed the agreement on the slave labor business, the president of the Federal Republic of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in the year 2000, on the day when we signed the agreement establishing the slave labor fund, delivered a clear, unequivocal statement acknowledging responsibility, even- he went even emotionally asking for forgiveness, etcetera, and he certainly was an anti-Nazi or whatever it is, but he was the head of the successor state of the Third Reich, and they were dealing with the consequences of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">Don’t get me wrong, I don’t say that everything that -- that was already accomplished 1s all that should have been accomplished, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">There will never be what the Germans call [speaks German here]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">The term [speaks German] means to make whole.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1055">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Well, let me ask you about the Israeli government at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">As -- and I don’t know whether you see it differently than the Claims Conference as a group of people, but the Israeli economy was in horrible shape at that time, and they had already accepted -- what were there, 300,000 or 500,000 survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">So they were in a very difficult position financially.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1059">ANSWER:  [indecipherable] know that the whole basis of the negotiations were -- they had -- there was a clear distinction of the foundation of the negotiations between the government of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and the Claims Conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">The government of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> requested or sought 1.5 billion dollars on the basis of the cost of absorption of 500,000 Jewish victims of Nazi persecution, first in the [indecipherable], first in the <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and subsequently in the -- 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And it was this one billion 500 million dollars which was the basis of the negotiation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">The settlement was then -- a portion of it was roughly half of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">But -- but that was the basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">The Claims Conference basis was compensation for depravation of liberty, for loss of provider, for damage to health, for interrupted --

ANSWER:  Yeah, I wanted to go back to, because you asked me earlier about who -- who were the people involved in -- in this whole process and -- and I think I -- I -- I didn’t answer it as fully as I th- think I -- I want to and I should. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">But as I say, whatever has been accomplished 1-initially and since and now and I’m sure going forward, is a product and the result of a collective effort of a group of individuals who are involved in a professional lay capacity that depends upon which individual and what phase and at what stage o-of -- of the various processes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">When I -- when we spoke earlier about the a-antecedents of all of these programs in the immediate postwar period, and th-the -- the main issues had to be negotiated with the U.S. government as the most powerful of the -- of the allied victorious powers, there were essentially four Jewish organizations that worked together in that effort, and that was the American Jewish Committee, the American Joint Distribution Committee, the Jewish Agency for Palestine at that time, and the World Jewish Congress. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">And -- and these were essentially, as far as the -- the Jewish agency for -- the Jewish Agency for Palestine were the American representatives, and of course Nahum Goldmann, who lived in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> at that time and was the chairman of the -- executive of the Jewish agency in addition to being the chairman of the -- executive of the World Jewish Congress and so on and I -- I may be off by a year or two [indecipherable] the titles, but in those two organizations they played a leading role already at th -- at the -- at the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">And -- and of the two American organizations, of course, they were domiciled in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and -- and th- their -- particularly the American Jewish committee had a -- a legal council in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , a man wh-who was also at times with the State Department, his name was Seymour Ruben. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">And -- and the American Je -- th-the Jewish agency on these issues was represented by their American council, a man called Maurice Bookstein, who was sitting -- who was living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> as an American Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">And -- a -- a -- and then of the -- the World Jewish Congress, there were two brothers, Jacob and Nehemiah Robinson. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">They both came from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">Jacob was already an international lawyer of some standing in the -- in the 1930’s in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , and Nehemiah was a outstanding scholar and he headed up the World Jewish Congress, created an institute of Jewish affairs it was called, it’s official title. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">It was a -- a <span class="BUILDING">research facility</span> , a research organization which Nehemiah led and directed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">And in many, many ways he was -- he was the co-conceptualizer of -- of a lot of -- of what we developed subsequently as our specific programs for demands, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">In addition to that, and of course in the -- in the -- in the Joint Distribution Committee, they had the co-council in Europe as well, a man called Jerome Jacobsen and -- and people in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> -- oh, for God sakes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">Come to me 1n a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">Eli Rock. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">E-]-i R-o-c-k.

<p><span class="sentence" id="1118">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1119">ANSWER:  Every year when we would elect officers in the g -- in the j -- JRSO, one year the chairman was a g -- a JDC designee, and the next year was a Jewish agency designee and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">So by the time the Claims Conference came into being, there was already a -- a group of -- of experts, professionals plus laypeople in these respective organizations, who were involved in the subject matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">And the delegation was expanded in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> because we brought in people from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">First of all 1t was important, remember, we had to make sure that the principle, western powers were -- were there, and it was important also to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">So a -- a man who was a member of parliament, whose name was Alec Easterman, who was member of our delegation, at least that he -- he didn’t sit all the time in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , he had to be an -- an MP in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , too, but -- and what was important, the German refugee organization called the Council of Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was headquartered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And Rabbi Leo Baeck, after whom the <span class="BUILDING">Baeck Institute</span> was named subsequently, was, so to say the -- the spiritual and the -- and the -- a-and the sort of leader of -- of this whole movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">So we -- we brought in -- in -- into the delegation the then executive head of their organization, a man called Goldschmidt, first name will come to me in a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And he was also, of course [indecipherable] familiar with German law. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">Remember, we had to negotiate ultimately, German legal commitments, etcetera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">And th-this was -- this was the professional team, together with Jerry Jacobsen, who was council of the JDC sitting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">And then of course, the Claims Conference leadership itself, the -- wh-which was supervising the negotiating, laying out the policies, because we couldn’t have 24 organizations being in permanent session, whereas Jacob Blaustein, who was -- obviously Nahum Goldmann as the president, Jacob Blaustein as the senior vice president, he was the head of the American Jewish Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">A -- by today’s standards he would be one of the billionaires. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">In those days he was a multi-millionaire [indecipherable] Baltimore 011 company. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">Amoco, American Oil Company, that was the Blaustein family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">And then Israel Goldstein, the head of the American Jewish Congress, Rabbi Israel Goldstein, a leading conservative rabbi with a large congregation on the west side of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and a leading member of the Jewish agency executive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">I mean, these are people [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">And Moses Leavitt who was the -- today would probably be the executive vice president of the American Joint Distribution Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">And as I told you, became the chairman of our delegation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">And Bookstein [indecipherable] and a man called Adolph Held, a president of the Jewish Labor Committee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">In those days, a much more str -- a stronger organization than the Jewish Labor Committee is today, they are still an organization covering a segment of Jewish life, but you have to know, particular for our negotiations, during the Nazi period, the Jewish Labor Committee in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> brought some of the German social democrats, some of the German trade unionists, even if they were in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and in exile, they would raise money and support them financially. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">They had a close, ongoing personal relationship with the second largest political party in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war, the Social Democratic party. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">And Adolph Held himself, came from the trade union movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">He was a senior official of the International Ladies Garment Worker’s Union.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1143">ANSWER:  Of Mr. Dubinsky’s union, if that means anything to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">And so it was Adolph Held, Jacob Blaustein, Israel Goldstein, Nahum Goldmann, Frank Goldmann, who was the president of B’nai B’rith, which was very important to us at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">And then from <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> was Sir Barnett Janner, who was the chairman of the board of deputies of British Jews, who is the oldest Jewish communal organization in <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , I think going back to -- to the end of the 18™ century or something, anyway, or maybe -- or maybe the beginning of the 19" century, anyway, one of the - I think the oldest central organization still exists, still a member organization of the -- of the Claims Conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">They all are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">Different leadership and so on, but the -- so --

Nehemiah Robinson and -- and then -- and myself and Ben Ferencz and I for -- I shou -- I mean I -- I took it for granted that Ben Ferencz was part of it, although Ben Ferencz would shuttle between fur -- between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Nuremberg</span> and -- and- and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , because he -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the WJ -- the JRSO had to continue to --

<p><span class="sentence" id="1153">ANSWER:  I mean, first of all, I was the executive director of the Claims Conference, which means I was the chief operating officer of the organization per se, because in addition to everything else, it had to be a functional organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">It had to have meetings, and it had committees and it had the board. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">And the moment we got money we had to haul out our location apparatus. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">We -- we were allocating 10 million dollars a year, which in today’s purchasing power we -- was at least a hundred million plus.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1158">ANSWER:  Somewhere between a hundred and 150 million dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">So we had to build another machinery for the allocation of funds and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And then I continued to be the executive director of the WJ -- of the JRSO, parallel function and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">And a-as I say, it was -- the negotiations themselves were of course a time limited operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">After we signed the agreements, this group dispersed.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1269">ANSWER:  That’s correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">Particularly in the area of -- of personal suffering and personal injuries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">How can one put a dollar number on psychological, emotional, and on -- and also physical consequences? </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">We always say, and I’m not alone in that, that what -- what we succeeded to some extent is to provide a measure of compensation, some degree, combined with what I said to you before, which is not tangible, but wh-what -- but to me extremely important, and that is the basic acknowledgment on the part of either the government or the entity or the agency that provides compensation, that it had responsibility, legal, moral, but responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">And on the other hand, among the hundreds of thousands of survivors, not everybody was able to make the kind of economic to build a new existence for oneself, economically, professional, business-wise or otherwise that -- that the compensation that they obtained for that -- for many it has genuine economic significance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">For people for whom -- who as I said to you before, whether it 1s in the depth of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> or -- or in the -- or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">resettlement towns</span> of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , or -- or in <span class="REGION">eastern Europe</span> , or wherever it is, when the compensation coming as a result of our negotiations and so on, may equal and exceed old age assistance or Social Security, or whatever it is, and it makes a difference between marginal existence in a late stage of people’s lives, and a sense of -- of some acceptable minimum with a -- with a minimum of -- of -- of dignity and of -- and of self respect in a sense that an individual can have, that is of great importance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">And -- and particularly in this stage where the vast majority of the survivors are 80 and over, remember anybody who was born in, let’s say who was 10 years old when World War II broke out in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">Born in 1929. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">That individual today 1s 78, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">This is a child survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">There are organizations of child survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">Kindertransport people, okay? </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">This is the young end of the -- of this population. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">And particularly in the <span class="REGION">western world</span> , with progress of -- of medical care and so on, people live longer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">I say people exist longer, you know, to me there 1s a great distinction between those two words. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">But people are there longer, in mo -- requiring much more care and attention for their medical needs and so on, with a greater strain and s -- on -- on their financial resources. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">So in a -- in a strange way, some of the compensation benefits today for the people who ended up retiring on a -- on a very modest basis and in some parts of the world on a below modest basis, or in a non-existent basis, th-this compensation 1s -- is truly meaningful, and is of great importance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">We negotiate periodically cost of living adjustments on the pensions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">One of -- I think one of the brilliant things that we did in the -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , is we wrote in a clause that the pensions, that the compensation pensions will be adjusted on a cost of living basis as the pensions of civil servants of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because we knew that the civil servants of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> have a powerful organization and they will fight for cost of living adjustments. </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">And we got the Germans to agree that the compensation -- we knew it is the compensation pensions will be adjusted cost of living- wise in the same percentage as those. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">So I say that to illustrate that the -- the economic impact for certain categories of survivors was and is important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">And as I say in some -- in some strange way, becoming more important now for those who were to retire in a -- on a -- on a very limited basis.</span></p>
