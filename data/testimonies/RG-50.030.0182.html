<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Could you tell me your name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name 1s David Pollack.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  And where and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prince Albert</span> , <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span> , in 1922.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  Tell me something about your parents and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in which you grew up please.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  My father came to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> in 1913 from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">He was an indentured worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Someone paid his fare across and he worked off this fee and then had a few hundred dollars and asked the man who had brought him over to find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> where with $300 he could buy a <span class="BUILDING">business building</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> overhead where he could live and enough money left: over to bring in his fiancée. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">They only place in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> where that would qualify was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kenistino</span> (ph), <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of 400 people then and I think 400 people now, where there happened to be a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> with a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> overhead and the whole thing including my mother's air fare, air fare - sea fare, was less than $300. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">So my brother and sister and I were born and brought up in this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hamlet</span> in <span class="REGION">northern Saskatchewan</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">QUESTION:  What was it like growing up in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">ANSWER:  It was very healthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">It was a simple childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">You, you were concerned with the weather and wheat and trying to, my father trying to sell the merchandise that in his little tiny <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Most of it wasn't actually sold. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Most of it was bartered because money was rare in the 30's when I remember the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">The farmers would bring in butter and eggs and cheese and furs and and roots so they would dig up herbs. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">I remember one called seneca root (ph) which you could make into some kind of over-the counter drug, and my father would look at these things and say they're worth such and so and then that person would take the groceries and my father would send these things then on to Prince Albert which was then a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> we would call it of five thousand, and so the family survived and my brother and I were sent to <span class="BUILDING">University of Saskatchewan</span> and my sister when she graduated from grade 12 was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to my mother's sister so that she could marry a nice Jewish boy, of which there were none in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kenistino</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We were the only Jewish family there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  What was it like to be the only Jewish family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Since I didn't, since I didn't know anything else it seemed perfectly normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Everybody was the only family there the only Ukrainian, the only Slavic, the only whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">People had to get along. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">There was no fire system. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">There was no police system. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">There was a municipal doctor, which meant he had an enormous <span class="REGION">territory</span> to travel so it wasn't wise to have, to revive old world animosities of religion, race, color or creed. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">People of course couldn't eliminate their prejudices, but everyone tried to get along, and so while my father would tell me you are Jewish and you must behave and not do things that will not be right, I didn't really know what that meant until I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kenistino</span> at age 17 to go to the <span class="BUILDING">University of Saskatchewan</span> , which was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saskatoon</span> , and I really have not encountered anti- Semitism in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">I can't say I've never because it's impossible not to encounter, but it's been minimal, perhaps because I don't think in those terms. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">I guess because of my childhood, so I knew I was Jewish but I didn’t really know what that meant and it didn't trouble me. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And certainly doesn't trouble me today. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">01:04
QUESTION:  You went to <span class="BUILDING">University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Was that: a radical change for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">It was a big change because this little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kenistino</span> , had minimal infrastructure. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">It had no running water. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It had outdoor <span class="BUILDING">outhouses</span> and in twenty below and thirty below and forty below, the typical prairie winters, something that I I'm glad I don't have to do to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Electricity came into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kenistino</span> when I was in <span class="BUILDING">junior high</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Before that we studied with coal oil lamps and we, with little felt wicks, and there were no such a thing as television of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">The radios were poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">We had no newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So <span class="BUILDING">University</span> was an amazing change as the studies let alone the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saskatoon</span> was a major change for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So I spent two years there and then I enlisted at age 19, just going on 20, because everybody was doing that and it was, as we now would call it, 1t was a good war and of course Hitler was something that the the Jewish people would talk about a lot in the prairies. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I might just say a word about the Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Since <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span> is a very large <span class="REGION">province</span> , peopled, dotted with tiny hamlets and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , the Jewish people would meet once a year for the high holidays in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> or another, by some pre-arranged system and hold the services without a rabbi but with a local cantor. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And they would pray and then they'd meet in the one Jewish woman's house and they'd eat and the men would talk politics and talk about Zionism and play cards and go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So although each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> had one or perhaps two Jewish families, they retained a sense of being Jewish without having Cheders or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I was bar mitzvahed but it was rather odd. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">My father sent me to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> twenty-five miles away every Friday night to memorize my bar mitzvah ceremony. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I didn't know what I was saying but I said it. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">My dad and mother cried copiously and everybody was happy and so there there was a sense of Jewishness but it was an arms-length sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">You enlisted in the army when? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">In what year?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  I enlisted in the Air Force in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I was then 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I enlisted when I was 19 but I didn't actually enter until I was 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And I spent the first year and a half in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I enlisted in Air Crew but I washed out because I wore glasses and my coordination with a helmet on wasn't good, and at that time in the early 40's, if you enlisted in Air Crew and then couldn't make it for reasons of of such a nature, you were given the first option to enter this new and secret world of radar. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">The reason was that you could advance more rapidly and it was a little bit more exciting than being ground crew and just repairing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">air planes</span> and doing ground duties. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">So I was allowed, I was offered the course in basic radar and I liked it very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">My mind works along lines of mathematics and I was commissioned after my eight months of of study and sent to an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> off the west coast of <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> at the southern point of the Queen Charlottes. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">There's there's an <span class="ENV_FEATURES">island</span> about the size of a <span class="DLF">city block</span> on which the Canadian's authority, military authorities, had put a <span class="BUILDING">radar station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="62">From <span class="REGION">Alaska</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baca</span> (ph), <span class="REGION">California</span> , the Canadians and Americans had interlocking circles such that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Japanese ships</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> , and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> , 1f they came towards the <span class="DLF">coast</span> , would be spotted by this radar system. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">And the one I was sent to was part of this interlocking grid of radar networks. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">And I was the junior of two officers. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">I was what is called a pilot officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">It's equivalent in the Army to 2nd Lieutenant, and the commanding officer who was a flying officer of Ist Lieutenant's rank, and I were, constructed and put into operation this radar system. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">We had 40 young Canadians absolutely isolated from civilization in a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rock</span> in the middle of the <span class="REGION">Pacific Ocean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">No women, no movies, no liquor, no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">Just a <span class="BUILDING">radar station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It wasn't, 1t wasn't exactly what I thought a war would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Nothing every happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">The Japanese didn't come so it was boring and yet we we were supposed to keep these 40 young men up to operational efficiency at all times, when their thoughts were on other things -wine, women and song - I know because I had to, I had to what is the word - read their mail to make sure that they didn't pass on any secrets, but they didn't talk about radar. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">They talked about other more basic things. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Anyhow, after six months I thought you know this is ridiculous and I volunteered to go overseas and so I arrived overseas and spent about a year in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> before D Day. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">My work in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> was mostly on radar-controlled anti-aircraft. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">We were trying to shoot down the buzz bombs or the V-I bombs by radar and also of course when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German bombers</span> would come over. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And also I spent six months in the North 01:10 Sea out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yarmouth</span> on what were called HSL's - high speed launches. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">The RAF and the American Air Force, the Canadians were always part of the RAF or attached to the RAF, would go out to bomb in the morning and afternoon and come back and there would be these fights over the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> and when one of our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">air craft</span> was shot down, if someone in our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bomber</span> could get a fix, a coordinational fix back to the <span class="BUILDING">intelligence headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , that person would look on a big map and see where we were anchored in our launches, and then send a a message by radio - there's an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> down or going down in your quadrant. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">try and find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And if it was daylight the skipper with his binoculars would would go towards where he thought the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bomber</span> might be. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">If it became dusk and we were getting close then it would be my job to turn on the radar which had a very high frequency low scan so that we could we could see into the water's edge and the job was to find these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> and pick up the pilots which were very rare vintage because they were very rare commodity. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">They were being shot down so quickly by the Luftwaffe (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So for about a year I was in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> doing these things on the <span class="REGION">land</span> with buzz bombs, shooting down buzz bombs, or on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> trying to find <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> and and pilots in their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lifeboats</span> with my radar. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And that was my job until D Day when - dates are a little fuzzy now in my mind - but I would say perhaps a week or ten days after D Day, I was asked, or not asked, I was told to go across the <span class="DLF">channel</span> with a mobile radar unit to set up a <span class="BUILDING">mobile transmitting station</span> as close as possible to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">The reasoning was as follows. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Radar was very primitive 45 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Instead of having chips and the little tiny things we have today, they had huge what used to call them bottles, big tubes, glass tubes, and great big power packs. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I mean you'd need a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> this size to power the transmitters in those days because they were so primitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So inefficient. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">That being the case the closer the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radar unit</span> was to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> that they were sending their impulses to the more accurate they'd be. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I guess I should just explain that word impulse.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  That's OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I mean here we ...
ANSWER:  Well but it might explain what I was doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">The Americans were bombing <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> by daylight with a bombsight called Norden (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="95">You actually looked down and the bombardier controlled the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> in the run in over the target. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">You looked at the target and twiddled knobs and you controlled the projectory of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So the Americans would bomb <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in daytime. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">The British and the Canadian and the Polish attached and the 01:14: Australians and the New Zeelanders attached to the RAF bombed at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And the way they could see see in quote marks the target was as follows. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">The heavy bombers the Blenheims (ph) and the Wellingtons the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> carrying the bombs would go out in units of I think it was ten or twenty. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And in between waves of the heavy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> would one or two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> that were called mosquitoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They were made out of plywood and they flew at thirty thousand feet at three hundred miles an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They had no bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">They had a radar set that you could see and hear and from the ground we would control that navigator in the mosquito such that when he came Over for example the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , we'd press a button, knowing~ where he was on our screen on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">He could hear and see what the signals we were, the impulses we were sending to him, and the bomb was dropped - not a bomb - a thermite (ph) bomb was dropped from the mosquito on a parachute, and that~ thermite bomb was brilliant, would, would stop "x" thousand feet above the ground and remain suspended in the <span class="DLF">air</span> and then five minutes later this wave of ten or twenty <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> would come over and bomb the thermite flare. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So you had had what was called twenty-four hour service. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The Americans bombing in day, the British bombing at night, and the radar controlling the British night bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And the farther you were from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircraft</span> that you were sending the impulses to, the weaker were the impulses and the more likely you'd get distortions on the screen or in the headset. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So that's why they sent our mobile teams across the <span class="DLF">channel</span> after D-Day to get closer and closer to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> so that we could guide the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">night bombers</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> while the Russians were coming in from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So I was sent with this mobile radar unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I think we were twenty or thirty or forty people, with the with the radar equipment, and we set course towards <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> - I don't remember the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Aachen</span> - A - A- C- H- E- N. [remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dueren</span> (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> and I certainly remember <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mons</span> (ph) in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> where we bivouacked. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And we were on our way to I don't know where, when an American came towards us on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motor cycle</span> , an MP I 10 guess, and I was in the lead <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> with my flight sergeant. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I was all of 23 then. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And I guess my sergeant was the same age, and this American comes up side and he said you guys ever seen a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">I had heard the phrase, but I thought being rather ideologically simplistic - I was from the prairies. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I had had two years at <span class="BUILDING">University</span> and then I was in the service, so I really hadn't thought about such things. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I'd read whatever newspapers I was given, but I thought that they were our propaganda system and their propaganda system, and we had stories about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and tortures and so forth, but I hadn't really given much thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I said to the sergeant, let's see what he means by this phrase. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And the American said its "x" kilometers down the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">It's called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And that's how I came to enter <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> I think a day or half, a day or two days after it was liberated by, if my memory's correct, the American 3rd Army, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">But that's how I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Tell me your impressions as you walked through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="127">What did you see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Well, there were inmates milling around. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">There were some soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">The inmates, there was a triage system under way. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Those who clearly were beyond any hope, or those who were dead or those who were clearly beyond any hope, were, were in one part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Those that seemed quite in decent health, in good health, were being sent out as quickly as they could get <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to take them out And in the remainder were, were there with doctors coming in 1:0 to look at them and see what they could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I saw the piles of, of dead bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">They were stacked in the way you stack beer bottles in the in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">You know, you put the head and then the bottom of the bottle, and then the front of the bottle and the rear of the bottle so that you can, they'll sl.ack without rolling over. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">They were stacked with legs spread apart and heads put in so that you could get bodies, a large number of bodies in a pile. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> with one of the <span class="DLF">doors</span> open and the remains of a body in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">There were scaffolding and piles of bones and of course the inmates themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I went into one <span class="BUILDING">building</span> where a number of men were lying on lhe <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> of this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , which was very dirty with excrement. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I was then smoking and I had this sweet capprel (ph) cigarettes which was a British cigarette in hard paper cover with silver foil, and I was smoking cigarette after cigarette because the smell was, the stench was very strong, and one of the inmates who was lying on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> signaled for ;I cigarette and I had three left and I sort of tossed them and I didn't want to get too close because I didn't know about typhus or I, I didn't know about the medical side of things, and they took out the three cigarettes and divided them and then they began to have a little jostling for the silver foil. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I guess 1t represented something of value after years of no value. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">It was a very, very disturbing sight to, to see them wanting this little piece of paper just because 1t seemed to have some value, monetary value Anyhow they would make V signs to us, and they smiled, those who had strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">They, I took photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">I took a number of photographs, which I've given to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> , of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> , of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">scaffolding</span> where they would hang people, of the bones, of the people stacked on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and being carted away in some kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or horse-driven <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">I don't remember which. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">I remember that the men's thighs were so thin that you could almost put~ my hand around it, it was just bone there. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">The flesh had literally melted away. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">You could put your hand around the tops of their arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Their faces were this wax, this yellow waxy face. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">The skin W21S drawn so tightly around the skulls that they almost just: looked like, like skulls with tissue paper around them. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">It was a very shocking sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">particularly my sergeant threw up. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">I didn't throw up. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I guess it was because it came as such an amazing blow you might say. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I, I repeat I was ideologically very simplistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I had never thought about such things happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">They hadn't entered my my mind in <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span> and in the early years of the my war time activity which were very occupied with technical problems and then drinking beer and going out with women. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I didn't I didn't think about ideology and philosophies of government and the racial thesis and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">So it was very, it was like somebody had struck me, but I, I, I wasn't as physically upset as my driver who wasn't Jewish and I guess it wasn't until the next day when the enormity of the thing came to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">I had a little diary that periodically I'd enter things, and I entered a couple of pages, which I think I've also given to the Memorial li...library. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">But clearly it was a very mammoth and, and disturbing event to a young, young kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">A young greenhorn you might say. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">Greenhorn for that kind of, of thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  What did you do in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Well, I, I had to go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I wasn't a flea agent. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I had my orders to be at such and such a point at such and such a time, but I wanted to do something and since I only spoke English I found a prisoner who spoke many languages and I said in the RCAF, Royal Canadian Air Force, attached to the RAF, the British Royal Air Force, officers have the right to send a little blue V mail, air gram letters, and when we sent them they'd go by <span class="DLF">air</span> to where ever. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Enlisted men might go by <span class="DLF">air</span> or might not go by <span class="DLF">air</span> depending upon <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> , so that was a privilege that British officers had. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So I said to this inmate who spoke many languages, look, I can't remain here long, and yet I'd like to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">If you will find some prisoners, some inmates who have friends or relatives around the world, if you will give me the inmate's name and his friend or relative's name and address, I'll send a little one paragraph, two sentence letter saying I have seen your friend or relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">He will soon be at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">displaced persons camp</span> in such and such. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Send him money or passports or food or clothing as soon as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">That inmate lined up a number of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I don't know how many because I did this twice, once at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and once a week later at a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> that I subsequently passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And I would say I wrote between one and two dozen letters -I'm not sure on the number all over the world, to <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> , to what was then <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> , now <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , several to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , one to <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> which I'll mention in a moment, simply saying I have seen your friend or relative names so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Send help to him care of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> - I've forgotten the name of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> where I was told they would go - it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> as quickly as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And then in each case I put, my address is Flying Officer D. H. Pollack, C29272 - that was my number - RCAF overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">You can reach me at that address. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I would be interested in knowing whether you have reached your friend or relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">So the whole letter was one paragraph with a little footnote. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And away those letters went. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And two weeks later some more went from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> that I visited. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Some years later - I kept the names and addresses of some of them, and 25 years later I came across a folder with these, with some of them - oh no, I think, I'm sorry - my mind now is getting clear - some of them replied to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I kept those in a folder. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">That's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And they simply said in varying degrees of, of excitement I received your note. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I did contact my friend or relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">In varying degrees of, of, of enthusiasm and warmth and emotion. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I didn't do any...you know, what would one do. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I, I did what I could and I and I didn't I didn't want to intrude on people's lives, but twenty-five years later I came across 1 :his folder and decided to write to two or three of them to say I've just found your letter to me of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">It's now 1960 whatever, '63, '68. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I'm curious to know whether the person that you told ME you had located is doing all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And I got two or three very fascinating letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">One if you'd like I'll tell you about. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Evidently one of the persons, who couldn't speak English, said I have a relative in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Windsor</span> , <span class="REGION">Ontario</span> , but I don't know his or her address. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">His name was Eisenberg (ph), I now find. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">I wrote to the Chief of Police in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Windsor</span> , <span class="REGION">Ontario</span> , saying I have met a prisoner in whether it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> or the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> I've forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">He or she, he needs help immediately and doesn't know his relative's address. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">Could you try to locate a mister, I think it was Hiam Eisenberg (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="202">The constable or the Mounties, I don't know who, put a little note in the Windsor newspaper and through that newspaper note, they located the relative who got in touch with Mr. Eisenberg in Europe and they wrote to me from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Windsor</span> saying thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">We've, we've seen your letter from the Chief Constable of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Windsor</span> and we have made contact and bless you and, and that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Many years later I decided to write and see whether Mr. Eisenberg was still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Windsor</span> and low and behold, he replied, saying I have never forgotten you because first of all you were an Ally, secondly you were an officer, thirdly you were Jewish, and for me this was, this was momentous. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">And I'm now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Windsor</span> and I opened a little <span class="BUILDING">air conditioning store</span> and I married in Europe and I have three Canadian children and we're doing well and we're very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">When the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> found out about the photographs that I had taken at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , they asked if I had other mementoes additional to the photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And I took out these letters and sent them; including Mr. Eisenberg's and then I thought I should tell him I've done this, because after all 1t was a letter to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">He said of course you can send them to the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Then he wrote me a second letter, which I've also given to the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> saying I must tell you of an odd occurrence in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I was handy with...1 was working in a some kind of <span class="BUILDING">foundry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">My number was, and he mentions his six digit number in the letter, but he said when I forged the new one I put the letter P, capital P, in front of it because I had noticed that prisoners who had a P in front of their number were less likely to be killed than those who didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">He said I wasn't killed, and to this day I think Lt had to do with the letter P which I think meant either political or Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">I received that letter, sent it on to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> , and ten days ago driving from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ottawa</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , my wife and I get these reading tapes - you put them in your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and a book 1s read to you - and this particular book was about a woman who had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and a third <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">And she mentioned the letter P as meaning political or Polish and being sort of a talisman (ph) so what Eisenberg had suspected as a thesis in fact was correct and so his life presumably was changed by this, this quirk of fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I called the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Museum</span> to say I was sending them this fascinating letter and suggested that they write to Mr. Eisenberg to get that little ID with the letter P on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">On such minuscule quirks one's life depends. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">It's really sort of mind boggling. (</span><span class="sentence" id="218">Pause) Well, I have received letters from people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Turkey</span> and in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I have a beautiful letter from someone in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> - two, two letters from what is now <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , one from <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , one from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bronx</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Several from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And I've kept them. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And I think they're now all in the custody of the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> and that was the little contribution that a, that a young kid was able to make to, to this Holocaust.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about the letter from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  I wonder if I could read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I have it here. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">it really is a touching letter. (</span><span class="sentence" id="227">Sure) it goes into much more detail than, than Mr. Eisenberg's about broader issues. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">I, I hope I can locate it. , </span><span class="sentence" id="229">I know I have it here and it is very (pause) it is very graphic. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">Dear Mr. Pollack. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">This is from Hiam Grossman (ph), <span class="DLF">48 Street</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Dear Mr. Pollack. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I thank you very much indeed for your kind letter of July 31, and I hasten to answer it as I was extremely pleased lo hear from you again. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">I had written him in the late 50's. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">My sister-in-law, Mrs. Sarah , was saved from Nazi captivation after she had been thrown into the <span class="DLF">extermination railway</span> whence the American liberators extracted her. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">In September '45 she arrived tn <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and thanks to good medical care and substantial nourishment, she slowly recovered from those terrible impressions. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">By chance I learned of the address of her son and his family whom my sister-in-law met unexpectedly for the first time at the <span class="BUILDING">Palestine Office</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Together they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> where they are now living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">The son is a government official and his nice little daughter Ruth is now seven and goes to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , So Ruth now is 25 years, later, so she's in her mid-30's. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">She 1s the only member of the family upon whom the dreadful past did not leave any trace. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">My sister-in-law, despite her unusual vitality and her strong desire to enjoy life, cannot forget the past and reconcile herself’ to the loss of her dear ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Naturally we try hard to make the last years of her life pleasant and we actually often wonder where these people found the physical and the emotional strength to survive the sufferings they have had to undergo. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">Obviously only the help of people like yourself has encouraged them to go on and to have faith in the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">It is said in the Torah, in quote marks, "Anyone who saves a single soul, has saved the world as a whole." </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And you may be justly proud to be one of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">I am very glad that you have afforded me this opportunity of thanking you from the bottom of my heart in my own name and in the name of my entire family for all you have done to save my sister-in-law's life to whom I am forwarding this letter, your letter, so that she can write to you also. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">I did not get a letter from her. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I was glad to learn that you got married in the meantime and I am wishing you and Mrs. Pollack much luck and happiness. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">It would be extremely nice to meet you both personally. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">You probably know that our small <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> attracts many visitors from all four corners of the globe and perhaps you will also consider once to spend a short leave here. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Wouldn't that have beer interesting? </span><span class="sentence" id="252">It is needless to say we would be only too pleased to offer you hospitality. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">I hope to hear from you again. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">For us the war was not terminated when the 2nd World War ended and my own grandson who was seventeen was among the first victims of the war of liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">But we feel that the sacrifices were not in vain, as after 2000 years of dispersal, we gained our homeland. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">It 1s our hope that our children will be granted a better world than this of today. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Who would have believed in 1945 that today the Germans are again allowed to sit in the family of nations as among equals. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">With the very best wishes and greetings for yourself and Mrs. Pollack, I am very truly yours, Hiam Grossman. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">I mean this is an example of another letter which was if have it here these are copies - that that the originals here all gone to, to your <span class="BUILDING">library</span> , to your <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> but one here - no I don't have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">From, from (pause) Mrs. Cutler 1n, in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but I, I don't have it handy. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Oh, oh here 1s the 1945 letter, August, so that's, that's the first one - that the next on~ was some :20 twenty years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Dear Mr. Pollack. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Words fail] me to thank you for your very kind letter of 17th just recetved. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">In the meantime we have received several letters from my sister-in-law, Mrs. Sarah as well as a cable giving us her address as quote, "<span class="BUILDING">Displaced Persons Center</span> , M , <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> ," dated 19 July '45, but as it was impossible to communicate with her at the above address, we sent her a cable to the quote "Palestine Office" unquote, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So that's, that's their reply to my air gram. (</span><span class="sentence" id="266">Pause) Well, this is an illustration.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">QUESTION:  What happened, this communication obviously this has gone on for all these many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Let us go back a little and ask what happened to Flying Officer Pollack at the end of the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  Well, I came back from the service in 1945 and finished my final work on a Bachelor. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I had, had two years when I enlisted and I took another year and a half and got a bachelor's degree from the <span class="BUILDING">University of Saskatchewan</span> , and then was given a scholarship to study at the <span class="BUILDING">University of Chicago</span> in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> where I took my Master's and all of my Ph.D. excepting the thesis, and then was offered a, a, a job with the <span class="BUILDING">World Bank</span> , the International Bank for Reconstruction Development here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , and worked there for a couple of year; and then joined the <span class="BUILDING">United Nations Secretariat</span> and had a thirty year career in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mexico City</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Santiago</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Chile</span> , and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Geneva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Then I came back thirty years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I married when I got the U.N. job, had three children and on taking early retirement in 1980, returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ottawa</span> , which was my wife's <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and I've been a professor at <span class="BUILDING">Carlton University</span> in the School of International Affairs ever since.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">QUESTION:  What effect has all of this had on you do you think? </span><span class="sentence" id="274">The experience in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , certainly the correspondence afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  Well, the initial effect was very powerful, very raw and very emotional to a young kid, but I think the effect on me, an odd way to put it is sort of been an intellectual one. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I, all my career both in the <span class="COUNTRY">United Nations</span> and teaching has been on how do systems work. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">What are ideologies of political systems and economic systems and how do they, how do you make them work, and the fact that the Nazis were able to design a philosophy and make it work so efficiently, there was based on extermination and torture and hatred and killing and superiority and inferiority of, of, of racial theories, the, the, the intellectual concept has stayed with me - how, how horrible it is and how easy it is to evolve systems that have such a blasphemous ideology and can be so efficiently run. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">This has stayed with me, so remember that my childhood was not that of a Jewish person, that is to say we were the only Jewish family and while I knew I was Jewish I didn't feel it sort of in through my chicken soup that Jewish children in a in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> would feel. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">I knew I was Jewish but I didn't know anything whatnot. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">So that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> had this first effect which was very raw as I say and it upset me. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">It just physically upset me, but afterwards it made me just aware of the horrors of being able to design and implement systems based on, on such a concept of human life and immorality and fear and hatred and finally this, this is what stays with me that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> proved that you can do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Do it well, from that point of view. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">As a matter of fact, not; don't I don't use such emotional words when I'm teaching, but I do tell students in my first class in the sessions when I teach development, the word development has been my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And I say you know I, I do remember one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">When I was a kid your age I say to the students, I'm, I'm fascinated how easy it was even for the Allies to take young people and put them in the same uniform, same haircut, same kind of shoes, same tie, and get them in a disciplined way to destroy, not with these horrible overtones of Nazis, but you can bring young people together to be disciplined to destroy. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">It's not hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">It's not hard to teach people to enjoy cutting down a big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">But how difficult it 1s to get people to join voluntarily to build and to develop it, to plant <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="289">That thought has stayed in my mind all my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Just that the Nazis carried it to a blasphemous and obscene result, but it is so easy to take young people and have them do things together in a tightly organized way, even though they, they want to be different. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">This has always been a big , a big paradox in my mind that it's easy to do to do that, so <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> just made me think very deeply about this paradox of civilization. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">How we can be Dr. Jekeyl's one moment and Mr. Hyde's the next. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I may just on a somewhat lighter note, if you don't mind, I'd like to tell you the story of the camera that took the pictures that that I've been talking about. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">in my childhood in <span class="REGION">Saskatchewan</span> , it was quite common for teenagers to be given a rifle because we shot game, small game We would shoot crows because they would eat wheat, and we’d shoot gophers and bush rabbits because they'd eat wheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So kids had a rifle, and I had a 22, and nobody thought about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">But when I was commissioned and went overseas the British gave officers in Europe, when we went across the <span class="DLF">channel</span> , gave officers side arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">We were gentlemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">We had side arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And enlisted men, men had these big rifles, 303's. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">On our way to as close as we could get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Weimar</span> before coming to this incident with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , we spent a night at one of the many <span class="BUILDING">German guest houses</span> on the edge of the, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Black Forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And there were these little round <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> where people would rest their arms and shoot at I don't know what, game of some kind. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So I asked my Flight Sergeant if after dinner he would come with me and help me regain my use of a of a powerful rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Because I said you know if there are Germans hiding in the which we were told there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">It was the end of the war and many Germans had taken refuge, refuge in this big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , being fed and protected by the civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">If there are Germans there and if for some reason they decide to shoot at us, my little side arm, my little popgun, wouldn't be worth anything at ten yards. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So I'd just like to practice again with a, with your 303, which 1s a big rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I think it was a Lee Enfield (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="308">So he said OK, and after dinner we went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">It was six o'clock or seven o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">It was good light, and I took this big rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">They, they have a recoil so you push them up against your shoulder ad I put my elbow on the little <span class="DLF">window</span> and he said you see that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> down there - I guess it was ten yards or whatever - see if you can hit it. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So I aimed and pressed the trigger twice, and whap, whap this these bullets - I, I hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , and I turned to him you know with great pride saying you know, that just shows you I hadn't forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And out from behind the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> come two German officers, who had been hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">They didn't know we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">We didn't know they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">But they thought that we'd seen them and were shooting at them, and came towards us and one pulls off a dagger or a little short sword and hands it to the Flight Sergeant saying something in German which we assume was don't, here, this is a bribe, and the other takes a little icon camera off his neck and hands it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Then we didn't know what to do with these two guys, so we phoned and an American military policeman came and took them away with great joy and I ended up with a camera. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And I got film and I think it's sort of fitting retribution that the pictures that I took and which are now with your <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> were taken with a liberated German camera although it was humorous tn the, after the event, but this, this was the way I, I got a camera to take the

<p><span class="sentence" id="319">QUESTION:  Is there anything you want to add, anything that comes back to you ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">ANSWER:  No, I don't think so. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I hear in <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> people saying it never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">The Holocaust never happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> never happened and I know they happened, because I was in them albeit only for a few hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I'm coming to the latter stages of my career and life and I have been involved with development I think perhaps as, well come to think of it maybe as a psychological antidote to destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Maybe if you think about these things and you're in very formative years you've spent three or four years destroying things and seeing such things as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , you, you want to build you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">You feel a compulsion to develop things, not to knock them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">The war and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> stay in my mind because I'm an economist and I work on the link between economic growth and social equilibrium and political stability and I wonder whether we can maintain a world in which these kinds of occurrences, the war and the the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwalds</span> , won't happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">So I think that it's admirable that your <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust Memorial Library</span> will be a place where young people and not young people can see and hear and read these things and not, not for not for emotional reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I've tried not to be emotional today. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">I, I haven't used my folders or my letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">As a matter of fact nobody even knew they existed until Hiam Bookbinder found out about them from, from one of the few people who ever saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">So my reason for being so happy to give what I have and tell what I have to the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> is not an emotional reason, to arouse emotions and passions but to have people think about these things so they won't happen again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="333">QUESTION:  Fair enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Before we break I realize there's one question we didn't ask you, and that is can you go back a minute to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> that you were in and do you, will you tell us what you remember about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="335">ANSWER:  It's less clear in my mind than <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , and I think it was briefer. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">What I would suggest is I do believe that Mr. Eisenberg was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> because when he wrote in one letter, he, he refers to me taking out my little book in the, and I think he said in the, in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">So if you have a chance to write to him or interview him, probably he would be better equipped to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I really don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">You know it's 1945 is what - good Lord, 45 years ago, and lots of other thoughts have come into my mind since then. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">But whoever was there it was clearly in reasonably good health, so that the thing wasn't so tragic. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">There wasn't so much pathos as there was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> where the triage system was so stark; in the these three groups of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">QUESTION:  Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">ANSWER:  You're welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">PAUSE - TECHNICNICAL CONVERSATION Well this was one of the <span class="DLF">furnaces</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="345">it was out of course, although I vaguely recollect seeing some embers, but I may be wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">There's a body or bones - more seen in one <span class="NPIP">side</span> than the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">I did all of this very hurriedly so I am afraid I don’t remember more than that. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION Well these piles of bones were in various parts o~ the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">They were also piles of shoes and belts and things. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Someone said they'd seen teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">But I didn't see teeth, but I, I did see this pile of just bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION I don't know how many bodies are underneath what you are seeing there. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I, I assume now that there must be three or four layers and I don't know whether that's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> or s horse 28 pulled <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , but they were just taking the bodies away obviously as quickly as they could so that there wouldn't be gangrene or whatever medical problems would last (ph), but they were just carted away as quickly as, as they could get Something to put them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Just like as I said, piles of beer bottles. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION I don't know who put the wreath up. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">I assume it ~as some one from the U.S. Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Could have been a civilian but I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">The thing that is so horrible is the emaciation of the legs and arms and waists and of course the fact the faces all begin to look exactly alike. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">They just all look like skulls. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">The skin is drawn so tightly there's no fat or flesh anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">They're just, they're just gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">They just evaporated. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">They're just tossed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And you'll see how they're piled on top of each other so as to get the maximum number in a short, in a minimum amount of <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">A really macabre sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">I - and it was all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> too. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Were not just there but all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION Well, it's 45 years ago and as I mentioned I was just 23 years old, but they all looked so pathetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">There were just piles and piles and even the clothing - you see the striped pajamas - that they didn't all have that typical garb. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">They all looked so sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">They were these, you couldn't, they weren't human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">They, they didn't look like people. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">They just looked like stacks of waxy things, and they just were, just rows of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">PAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION I think I had in the photographs somewhere the - I should have mentioned this and I didn't - the lamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">End of Tape #1 Conclusion of Interview </span>
