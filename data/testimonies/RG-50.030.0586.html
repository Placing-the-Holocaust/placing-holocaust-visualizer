<p>ANSWER: None</p>
<p>QUESTION:  It’s really lovely to see you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Lovely to see you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">What was your name — what is your name now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  My name is Ninetta Feldman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  And what was your name at birth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="7">ANSWER:  My name at birth was Ninetta. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">I was actually named after my grandmother, which was the tradition in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , to have the daughter of — the first daughter to be named after the mother of the father. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">So my grandmother’s name was Sarah, so I became Sarah, Serena, Nina, Ninetta. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">So I ended up with Ninetta. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I had many first cousins with name was Nina, they also were named after my grandmother Sarah, but they used the Nina. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">I- It -</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Was her name Nina also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  No, her — my grandmother’s name was Sarah, Sarah, but the — the granddaughters were named either Nina or — Nina, for the most part. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I was an exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  You were Ninetta.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Ninetta. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">September 14, 2010</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And your last name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  My n-—my last name, maiden name is Matza.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">QUESTION:  Now, th — when it’s a male, it’s Matsas, is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Matsas, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">And if it’s a female 1s Matza, which really means you are the daughter of Matsas. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">In — in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , you’re either the daughter of someone, or the wife of someone. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">So it’s the — you — you decline the — the — the name, Matsas, of Matza — of Matsas, which becomes Matsas, the generative — you decline the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And so my name, maiden name is Matza, not Matsas.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Now, wh-wh-when one 1s named after the — your grandmother —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I’m sorry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  Sarah — when you were named after your grandmother —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  — was she still alive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="30">QUESTION:  So this is different than in the Ashkenazi tradition isn’t it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">QUESTION:  That you can be named in the Sephardic tradition with someone who’s alive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">ANSWER:  That’s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I think the Greek Jews adopted this tradition from the Christians because the Christian Greeks also name their children after the grandparents, regardless whether they’re living or not, and so the first son is named after the father of the father, after the September 14, 2010 grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">The father of the father. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">The second son will be named after the father of the mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Oh, I see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">ANSWER:  The — if there’s a daughter, the first daughter will be named after the mother of the father, and the second daughter after the mother of the — the f— the mother, after the mother of the mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So it creates a lot of confusion, because there are so many people with the same first name and surname.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  Right, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And what — when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">ANSWER:  I was born March 21‘, 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  Right, so you were a very young child at the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Very young, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  Now was — y-you have a brother, Michael.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Was he named after —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  After my grandfather Nahoum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  Now, to have a name like Nahoum in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> does not make a child very comfortable, because it’s very unusual. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So he was — he grew up known by that — his nickname, Mykas(ph), his friends called him Mykas(ph), but his official name is Nahoum. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And September 14, 2010 then when he came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , he changed his name further, from — Mykas(ph) became Michael.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="52">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">ANSWER:  But his birth name is Nahoum, after my grandfather.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">QUESTION:  And his — and his middle name now, is Nahoum.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">ANSWER:  Right, right, he retained the name, but became his middle name, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Now, since you were so young at the time, do you think you can distinguish between what your earliest memories are, and what you were told happened, or is that difficult?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  That’s a very, very good question, I often sort of struggle with it, trying to determine whether my recollection is a firsthand experience, or it’s a reconstruction of what I heard from — so many times from my parents and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">There are certain scenes that I know for sure; I’m talking about the earliest recollections, when I was perhaps three years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">There’s certain scenes that I — I know, I remember very vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">And I know these are firsthand recollections.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  So perhaps when we speak, you can make a distinction between what you know, or your f—</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">QUESTION:  — your own memories, and what you’re not sure about —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Do you remember moving to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , or — or you don’t remember that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  It was — it was [indecipherable] there, when my brother, of course was probably 11 years at the time, he was —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Do you remember your brother at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">ANSWER:  Was another early recollection that I have. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">This is — this is in 1941 - 42, when there were tremendous food shortages in — in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , and I remember, you know, my — my parents had to go to the nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , such as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Moustafree(ph</span> ) was one of the — one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Verkini(ph</span> ) was another one, where they would go to buy food supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So my mother would absent herself for long periods of time, and my brother, who was 11 - 12 years old, was very concerned that when — that when I woke up in the morning and I opened my eyes and I realized Mother wasn’t there, I would start to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">So I remember him with his spoonful of fruit preserves, is like st — not strawberry, preserves like some other kinds of fruit, waiting for me to open my eyes and put this teaspoon full of — of jam, so that I wouldn’t cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">I remember that very vividly. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And we have a thing, I remember where my brother was making dolls for me, massive production. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They were very simple little dolls with sticks and you know, painted faces, but he would do that to amuse me, and I remember that, too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  That’s very sweet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  Yeah, he was very sweet, very attentive, and very loving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION:  Well, you — I’m — I’m suspecting that you were told how long you stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">September 14, 2010</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, we — we stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> from the time my father was drafted, which was — he —he was supposed to report to his company April 1‘, 1940 — 1941, until the Italians surrendered, which was the end of April, and we — my father was actually among the last soldiers to return from the front. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">He never saw battle, because as soon as he reached the front, negotiations started, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> came to the aid of <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and negotiations started for a peace treaty. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So he never saw battle, but he was — he was untrained. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">He was — he — this was the second time he was drafted. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The first time was when he was 21 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Now, he was 35 - 37 years old, he was overweight. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">He was not trained the first time, he had an office job. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">And certainly not trained the second time. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">So he didn’t really know how to use a rifle — basic, he never had basic training. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And so he was forever not — he was not able to keep up with the others — Greek soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">He was separated from his company several times. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">He had to deal with a mule that was not very cooperative. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">So, going to the front and returning, he was — was a struggle for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So he was among the last soldiers to return, and so my — I —I heard my mother and brother saying how they would go out to the main <span class="DLF">street</span> every morning, every day, waiting for my father to show up. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">It was a very anxious time for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So, after he returned, we — we, the whole family returned to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">This is — this is the time when German and Italian troops began pouring into the — the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">A-And Germans actually first came to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , but then later on, as we will discuss, later on the — the — the — the occupation zones were determined and the Germans occupied the northern part of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">occupation zones</span> were determined and the Germans occupied the northern part of Greece, and the Bulgarians another section. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">September 14, 2010</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yes, the ri —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Small section —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Small section of the north, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  — in the north, while the rest of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was 1— occupied by the Italians, with the exception of half — half of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Crete</span> and some major <span class="ENV_FEATURES">islands</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Aegean</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So — so we — we returned to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> after my father was discharged.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  But you were born not in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , right? </span><span class="sentence" id="164">You were bo —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I was —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — you were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Arta. </span><span class="sentence" id="166"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span> is a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , because my father was transferred to — he had several transfers. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">First he was transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span> and then — then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Preveza</span> , and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Preveza</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">So when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , I was two years old, but I— I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And I often think of how chance events determined, at that time at least, your — whether you were going to live or die, because had my father not been transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , if he had stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Preveza</span> , the chances of our survival would have been very ni — much diminished.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">ANSWER:  So this — this chance events determine —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  What happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  — what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">September 14, 2010</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Now, he was working in <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  Yes, he was working for the National Bank of Greece, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">He started his career in — in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="176">His father was in the milk and wine business.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="338">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">So we — we didn’t know where to go — coming back to the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And at that time there were two resistance movement in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="341">One was based in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Epirus</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , the outskirts of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">EDES was headed by Napoleon September 14, 2010 Zervas, and they were known as the — but, at that time, the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> was polarized between the — the nationalists, the right wing people, and the leftists. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And so the resistance movements were also polarized. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">You have EDES, headed by Napoleon Zervas in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Epirus</span> , and then EAM-ELAS, much larger, very well organized resistance movement in the countryside of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , but also within the cities of — of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">EAM-ELAS</span> , much larger, very well organized resistance movement in the countryside of Greece, but also within the cities of — of Greece. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And so we had neighbors, friends, who advised us to go to EDES, and other friends who advised us to go to a <span class="REGION">territory</span> controlled by EAM-ELAS. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">So we had some very close family friends, the Bokoros family; there were three brothers and two sisters, actually three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">There was Christos and Thermas(ph) Bokoros, and we knew them, we became fam — we became family friends because their sister Elestair(ph) was married to a man who was a colleague of my father’s in — in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="348">I think we met — they met them either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Preveza</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span> , I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And unfortunately her husband, Elestair’s husband died, and the whole family moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> and they lived — and so she and her children lived with her brothers, Christos and Thermas(ph) and Kostas Bokoros. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">So, we decided to ask them for help, and they were wonderful people, they did everything they could to assure us that we’ll find you a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we’ll get you out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="351">And so after we distributed our belongings to the neighbors, my mother, my brother and I, we — we sent some of the material, clothing and food and household utensils, with a porter to transport these things to the Bokoros’ <span class="BUILDING">house</span> <span class="BUILDING">Bokoros’ house</span> , and then we, the three of us, my mother, my brother and I followed behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">My father went to work that day, he had to — they received September 14, 2010 a very large amount of money, and he was replacing the — the cashier, so he had to go there and to count the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And so we reached the <span class="BUILDING">Bokoro</span> — Bokoros’ <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and a few minutes later — I remember this very vividly, I know this is a firsthand recollection. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I remember a German bursting into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and — and then my mother, you know, she saw this — she saw him, and she quickly pushed him in — pushed me into the adjacent <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and she quickly pulled the covers off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and pretended to calmly make the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , as though she belonged there. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">She’s a very quick thinker, sh — amazing person. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So th-the — the German sort of looked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I don’t — we don’t know what — who he was looking for, and then he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">But 1t was a very frightening experience for — for — for all — for my mother and — and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">I don’t remember where my brother was at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">All I remember was my mother making the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">And she asked Christos, one of the Bokoros brothers to quickly go to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and tell my father to — to drop everything and come to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we had to leave immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">So Christos goes to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , and told my father that — does he have — even though you haven’t finished counting the money, you have to drop everything and leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">An-And certainly the people in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> were very cooperative. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">They signed everything as though they had cou — as the mon — as though the money had been counted and everything, or the transaction was very orderly. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And so my father comes to the <span class="BUILDING">Bokoros house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And then, where there’s another problem they confront is the lack of transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">The Germans had requisitioned all means of transportation; <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> , <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mules</span> , horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">And so the brothers September 14, 2010 couldn’t find a way for us to leave that day, which was October second. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And so we spent the night in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and the following day they came with a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="370">They found a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> that was going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kremasta</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">This was a <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river Acheloos river</span> <span class="RIVER">river Acheloos river</span> , nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Was so-some distance, few kilometers outside <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">And he had — the taxi driver had other passengers to transport to the — the the <span class="BUILDING">Acheloos spa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And so this is we — we got in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tax1</span> with some blankets, and you know, some household ma — equipment, materials that we brought with us, and so we left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">I remember that, I remember how my mother said we should crouch into the — the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> , not to draw attention to ourselves, because people did not use <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxis</span> then to — to — to move around, we didn’t want to — to draw attention to ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And then as soon as we — we came to the outskirts of the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , we had to pass through a <span class="DLF">German checkpoint</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">And the driver, who apparently did this route quite often, he knew how to deal with the German guards there, and he gave them some raisins and cigarettes, and they let us pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And then —</p>

<p>ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Th-There were two sources of — of sa — food supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">One was we — my parents had, as I said earlier, they had stored a lot of food in the — the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And so they send a man with a horse to bring food supplies from — from ours — our supplies in storage in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="578">And the other food supplies were from the villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">There were some that were very affluent and they would — would sell in large quantities. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">And so my parents stuffed a lot of stacks of these food supplies and arranged them up against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , and it formed sort of a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sofa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And so we had a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to sit and we had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> to sleep on. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">But that was all. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">There was no running water, no electricity, no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="584">But my father was a very resource — resourceful person, he — he said just — just let’s pretend we are living 1n primitive times, before electricity was invented, and we just have to — to learn from the villagers how they live, and we’ll do the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="585">QUESTION:  And how — do you know how they found this <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="586">ANSWER:  The — the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> we lived in, you know, when we arrived, and there were villagers that approached to see what was going on, one of them stepped forward and said, oh, I September 14, 2010 have a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and they — and they rented — we rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">The — one thing that my mother had brought, she insisted that we bring to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was soap and sugar, because the — the Greek money had lost its value because of inflation that the Germans had printed a lot of money, and the ger — the Greek drachma had lost its value, so people conducted these transactions with goods, with bartering that was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">So soap and sugar was a very desirable, important commodity, and we had brought a lot of that, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="589">QUESTION:  Interesting that she thought of that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="590">ANSWER:  Yeah, she was a very smart person, very smart.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="593">QUESTION:  Like wa — like a couple of weeks or something, or less than that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">ANSWER:  Well, we stayed in — you see, after we — we — we purchased food, and we also — we got a goat. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Now, I’m not sure whether we got a goat at this point, or later on, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">But I remember that for me, getting a goat was the dream of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">It was a goat of my own, and the — and it was really a — in order for us to have a source of milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And th- the goat spent most of the time with the Tsulamitsu(ph) family, they were very nice, very hospitable, kind, generous people. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">And they spent the time there, they would milk the goat and bring the milk for us to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">But we also, you know, I spent a lot of time with — with the goat, I — I really became very attached to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So after we — we acquired all these food supplies, we felt very comfortable in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">It felt like a vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">I September 14, 2010 was going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , my brother had brought his <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> books, and my father said, you should start studying. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">And my father had brought a book of English method — how — a method to learn English without a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">I remember that book. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">My brother has it — still has it. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">And — and of course my mother didn’t need any — any additional work. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">She really had to work very hard because there was — she had to do the laundry and the cooking and all the washing of the dishes, without — without a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> , without running water. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">It was a real hardship for her. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And so we didn’t felt comfortable at that point, and my father started writing letters to our rel-relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , urging them to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and — and go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And we used friends t-to — to transport these letters from — from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> to a colleague of my father’s, Evyanea(ph) Papadapoulou(ph) I believe was her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">And she would in turn send the letters to her sister or brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , and they would deliver them to our relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">And everything was written in code, and we never used the word Psilovrahos, it was our — it was a code word like, our <span class="NPIP">place</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , or our <span class="NPIP">vacation place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And so we were urging them to leave, and the reply was that everything is fine here. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">We have plenty of food, and they were actually worried about the children catching cold up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , because at that time, the ger — there — there was no indication of anything was going to happen to them now. </span><span class="sentence" id="616"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> at this point is occupied by the Germans, but there was no indication that anything bad was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">So — so we felt very secure in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and we actually began to enjoy our life there, vacation September 14, 2010 spot, until suddenly it was — I believe it was November, the end of November, when Yonas Mionis, this is the same man —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Same guy, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">ANSWER:  — same guy, he comes — he — he — he was — he had been running, he — he — he — he arrived to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and from another — another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called 10s — Agios Vlassis, a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and told my parents that we have to leave and find another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we have to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> immediately, or — or by — by tomorrow morning, and go to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , because the Germans have advanced to — ar-are-are — are in Agios Vlassis, and they are advancing in the direction of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agios Vlassis</span> , a nearby village, and told my parents that we have to leave and find another place, we have to leave the village immediately, or — or by — by tomorrow morning, and go to another place, because the Germans have advanced to — ar-are-are — are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agios Vlassis</span> , and they are advancing in the direction of Psilovrahos. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">By that time there were two more Jewish men who had ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> , they had come from another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , I believe Helkese(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="620">And of course you know we were — my parents, they panicked. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">They — they were advised to go to a higher <span class="NPIP">place</span> up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> <span class="NPIP">higher place</span> up in the mountains. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">And we arranged with a mule driver to come the following morning, to transport us to this <span class="NPIP">higher place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="623">And I remember th-the — oh well, during the night — during the night, was a very frightful night, because we didn’t know whether the Germans were advancing during the night, but there was a big explosion, a distant explosion. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">We didn’t know where it was coming from. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">I should say that when Yonas Mionis came to alert us of the advance of the Germans, there was there — the church bells started to ring alarm, and these young men of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">EPON</span> was calling everybody to his feet, and urging able-bodied men to take their weapons, rifles, whatever they had, and go to Agios Vlassis to stop advance of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">So, September 14, 2010 the following morning, this mule driver arrives and — and now again, I don’t know whether I heard my mother say that, or I heard her say that much later, but 1t impressed me that these — what kind of mules are these? </span><span class="sentence" id="627">These are just a — they look like big — big dogs; they were very small. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">And of course, we were very grateful that there was a means of transportation, so we loaded a few — a few things and along with the other Jewish men, we started climbing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="629">Now, this <span class="NPIP">part</span> I know is firsthand experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">I remember my mother saying — I was getting tired, and my mother kept saying, keep walking, keep walking, you have to — because I was behind everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And I don’t know whether she said the Germans are coming, but all she was urging me to walk faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And so it — it was a — it was a rainy day, and I remember my mother insisted that we all wear extra clothing for warmth, and finally we reached a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , this mule driver took us to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a man called Chiandafelis(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="633">It was a — th-there were no other <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> there, just his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">And of course, he opens the <span class="DLF">door</span> , sees this unlikely group of people, city people at his <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> , he didn’t know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">And — and it was revealed that — that wi — th-the — the mule driver told him who we were and why we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So they probably — he probably told them that we are Jewish, and that the Germans were advancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">I — I don’t know exactly what he told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">But when the man, Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) heard the word Agrinion, he became very excited, because he told us that his daughter Theandafela(ph) was working for a family in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , the family of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Davaroukas(ph</span> ). </span><span class="sentence" id="639">And it so happened that Davaroukas(ph) was a colleague of my September 14, 2010 father’s in the National Bank of Greece. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">So he became very excited, because my father told him, oh I know your daughter, she came to the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> several times, and I know her, she is a very nice girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And you see, a lot of villagers would send their daughters into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> to work as maids in hope that they would learn to grow — to learn — acquire some skills with city people. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">They would take them out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and they would work as maids to bring some income for the family, and also learn to be nice young ladies, the way city people were. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So he welcomed us, you know, from strangers we became friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">He welcomed us and — and offered us a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to — to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">The Greeks are very hospitable people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">QUESTION:  Even — even in danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">ANSWER:  Even in danger, it’s — it’s a — it’s a tradition, and 1-in fact, in danger, they — they sense that there is a common enemy, and we have to help one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And that was from my mother’s memoirs, when she describes her many visits into the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> , this is the feeling that I get, that the people were welcoming. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">The-They saw this woman and her son, because she would go around with my brother, and they’d try to help as much as they can. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">So we make arrangements to — to spend the night in Mr. Chiandafelis’ (ph) <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="651">And then the next morning — or rather it was, perhaps — no, I think it was the same day; it was raining and then when the rain stopped, we stepped <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">And it was at that point that my brother saw a group of men with horses or mules, ascending the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And — and he said, the Germans are coming, the Germans are coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And that, you September 14, 2010 know, created panic, and everybody just dispersed and hid behind rocks, behind <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And then the Chiandafelis(ph) re-realized that we were terrified by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And so at this point they decide that it’s best for us to spend the day in a <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">In Arapo(ph) Kefalas(ph) was the name of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> , and spend the day in — and spend the night in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And that’s what we did.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="666">ANSWER:  Yes, we — we brought some blankets, soap and sugar, in pillowcases, because as I said earlier, my mother used the soap and sugar to barter other items. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">And 1n this case, we didn’t know wh — where we were going, but this was a way of paying the people in whose <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we were gonna stay, soap or sugar.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="668">QUESTION:  But I wa — I was interested to know whether you as a child brought — brought a toy of some kind, would you — would you bring one of the dolls that your brother had made?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">ANSWER:  Oh yes, no, I didn’t have any toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">I do not remember having any toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">I really did not have toys. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And I didn’t miss them because none of the village children had toys.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="673">QUESTION:  Had toys.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="674">ANSWER:  Yes, we — it was always improvising things. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I remember one of the activities I used to engage in was building a clay oven, like the one my — a small one, like the one my father had built, cause I had helped him build the clay oven on the side of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">clay oven</span> on the side of the house.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="676">QUESTION:  This was in a — Agrinion, or —</p>

<p>QUESTION:  In a regular <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">ANSWER:  — in a regular <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with running water, and <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="678">But no, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="679">So my — I remember my father built a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">clay oven</span> and — and I know exactly how to build a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">clay oven</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">If you want me to build one for you, I can do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">QUESTION:  You can do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="684">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">QUESTION:  So you helped him do this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  Yes, all I had to do was I had to gather rocks, and there were plenty of rocks, because this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> is just covered with rocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">And so he made a — a mound of rocks, and then he dug up the soil and extracted some clay, mixed it with hay to reinforce the — the mud, and then — oh we — we piled the rocks on the top of the — a large flagstone. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">You pile the rocks and then you cover the rocks with this mixture of clay and hay. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And so you create a dome, and there’s two o — there are two <span class="DLF">openings</span> , one in front to put the food in, and out, and then one at the top for the smoke to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">And so when the clay is dry, you remove the rocks from <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and you create this hollow space, and you use wood to sh — heat up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> , and this is how you — you bake things, and —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So did your mother bake in there? </span><span class="sentence" id="691">She — she — September 14, 2010</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, yes —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — and she cooked food?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  Yes, there was the only way to cook, to bake something. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">We had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> in — ins — in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and at first she used the — what they call a gastra. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">It’s — it’s a metal dome piece of like — well, the — the cover of a pot, but fairly large, and you light the fire and then you, in the hot ashes and the smoldering charcoal, you can bake something, provided you have this gastra on top of it, because it keeps the heat <span class="NPIP">inside</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  But in a— I believe gastra was something that we borrowed from — from the villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Villagers were very generous, very helpful, the — they realized that we were not equipped for this kind of life, and they were willing to share their tools or — or kitchen materials of — to — to help us manage. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">But for some reason this gastra had to be returned to the villager and so — so my father had to construct this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="699">It was not his invention, it was very common and I’m sure the villagers told him how to construct one. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">But my father was always interested in learning things and experimenting with different devices. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">So — so, going up to the — so really, I did not have any toys, but this is — so I used to build small ovens fol — following that model.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">QUESTION:  Right, right, with other kids.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">ANSWER:  With other kids, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">QUESTION:  And did you do anything with these little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="705">September 14, 2010</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, we — I wanted to light a fire, but of course, you know, my mother, you know, was absolutely against 1t, because it was dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">At some point in my life, in my childhood, I did light a fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I was fascinated by this — by these — this structure of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="708">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="709">ANSWER:  And after the war, I think — I know that I — I lit a fire in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">It’s quite interesting, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="711">QUESTION:  It’s interesting, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">But you didn’t bring any of those little doll — like one doll —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, no —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">You — you — you were not attached to anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="714">ANSWER:  No, not really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="715">QUESTION:  It’s interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="716">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">The thing that I was attached, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , was this goat. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">I— I really was — became very attached to that animal.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  So did you miss the animal when you left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">ANSWER:  Actually, I missed this animal when it had to be killed, because at the later point in our stay in — in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , the — the goat became sick and had to be slaughtered. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">And so they killed the goat and I wa — I was really — I don’t think my parents realized how devastated I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I was a rather quiet child that didn’t share my feelings or talk about things. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I don’t think I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And so when they killed the goat, they — the villagers told us that you have to September 14, 2010 cut it into small pieces, and put it in a barrel with a lot of salt to preserve it for the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And that’s what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">And th — it turned out that the goat was pregnant, so —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Not sick?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="727">ANSWER:  Not sick, or perhaps it was both, and my father threw away the fetus, but one of the — the Jewish men in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , those that had joined us at a la — later point, was told that the fetus was thrown away, and he was starving, literally starving, and he went, picked up the dead fetus, cooked it and — and they ate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="728">QUESTION:  Could you eat this goat?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="729">ANSWER:  The goat? </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Yes —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  You could.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="731">ANSWER:  — it’s regular meat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="732">QUESTION:  No, I mean, given your feelings about it —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="733">QUESTION:  — I was wondering whether you could —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Oh, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">I-I don’t think I refused the meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I was so hungry and by then it was no longer a goat, 1t was just a piece of extremely salty meat, it wasn’t even palatable.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="736">QUESTION:  Let me ask you something, cause you said that you were a quiet child. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Do you think that you became a quiet child because what was going on around you was so difficult, and you thought that maybe you shouldn’t speak what you were feeling? </span><span class="sentence" id="738">September 14, 2010</p>
<p>ANSWER:  I know that my parents many times described situations where I was hungry or very thirsty, and they said, but Ninetta did not complain. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">So I don’t know what was going on through my mind that we were — had all these hardships, and there’s nothing that can be done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="741">ANSWER:  So I —it’s very hard for me to — to know — I don’t think that the — the war experience affected me in the way that made me frightened and made me quiet, because for me, the experience of — of living in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , where I was free, I was really free to go anywhere I wanted as a child, surrounded by this wild beauty of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ; the animals, goats and sheep and donkeys and chickens everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">It was — it was — it was a positive experience, and I think — I have a feeling that this is where I developed my — my love for nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I — I—I just — cause I was so close to <span class="ENV_FEATURES">nature</span> , so close to the animals, to this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wilderness</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">So I don’t think it had a negative impact on me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">QUESTION:  Doesn’t seem like it —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No, cause —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — when one meets you. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">But you don’t — you know, one doesn’t know whether we — when you talked about the fact that you didn’t express your feelings about some things, so they didn’t know what you felt —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">QUESTION:  — that maybe that was a — that was partly a response to how difficult you saw that. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">September 14, 2010</p>
<p>ANSWER:  It is possible that — I don’t know how mature I was for my age —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">ANSWER:  — but maybe that — made that valuation, but I never felt I was hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I didn’t go into hiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">ANSWER:  We were free.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">ANSWER:  And — and — and so, really a designation of a survivor, a survivor, it had never entered my mind until I was identified as a survivor here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="756">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="757">ANSWER:  Because for us in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , survivors were those who returned from the — survived the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="758">QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="759">ANSWER:  Not the ones who survived hiding 1n — 1n the —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="760">ANSWER:  — up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , or even within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="761">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="762">ANSWER:  And I compared notes with other people who had similar experience, and they felt the same way. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">They were not survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">We didn’t have to — we didn’t have to hide, really, during that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">September 14, 2010</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right, right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  Although we were hiding from Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">QUESTION:  Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">But in a different — in a different way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">ANSWER:  Yes, exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And my suspicion is also that even in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , the — the word survivor has taken on different meanings as the decades have gone on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="772">ANSWER:  Oh yes, yes, it has really expanded.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="773">QUESTION:  Expanded much more.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="774">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="775">QUESTION:  So you were going — you — you went from the — the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">QUESTION:  — up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">QUESTION:  — on me — on a mul — you were on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mule</span> that —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  On — on foot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">QUESTION:  On foot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="779">ANSWER:  The — the mules were simply carrying —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Carrying stuff.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">ANSWER:  — our belongings, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="781">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">So now you know you’re going to a <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I mean, did you — did — September 14, 2010</p>
<p>ANSWER:  N-No, we are going to this <span class="BUILDING">man’s house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="784">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="785">ANSWER:  And this is Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right, who had the dau — the daughter who — who — so he was very comfortable with all of you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="786">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">But then there was this incident of my brother seeing this group of men and horses or mules ascending this <span class="DLF">precipice</span> and she panicked and said, oh the Germans are coming, and created a lot of panic among all of us, because in addition to my family, there were now three additional Jewish men; one of them was Yonas Mionis, the resistance leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And we all dispersed behind rocks, behind <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and that 1s when — oh, and then Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) sent his son, Spyros down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> to see who these people were and he discovered just villagers returning to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">But then they recognized that we were terrified of the possibility of being discovered by the Germans, and so they rec — Chiandafelis(ph) recommended that we spend the day in this <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> , called Arapo(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Kefalas(ph), and — and the night at his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="791">And that’s exactly what we did, this Spyros, Mr. Chiandafelis’ son guided us to the — to the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> , and that again, I have a firsthand recollection. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I remember this very vividly as a child going into a <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="793">It was quite an experience, and I was — I was frightened. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I was frightened at first, because it was so dark, especially, you know, before our eyes adjusted to the darkness, it was very dark, and there was all kinds of formations of stalactites and stalagmites. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">And my father September 14, 2010 found a little <span class="DLF">ledge</span> on the side, sort of halfway into the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">It was like an <span class="DLF">alcove</span> <span class="INT_SPACE">alcove</span> , and we spread the blankets, and the four of us huddled together in this dark <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">And — and my father, he — he always tried to calm everybody down, and — and he — this a — he’s a — was a very good storyteller. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">So he would tell us different kinds of stories about his exploits, ab — as a soldier going up to the — to the front, the Albanian — <span class="REGION">Greek Albanian front</span> or — and then Bible stories, lots of Bible stories, which he embellished greatly to entertain us. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And I don’t know whether this is — actually happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">I don’t know he — he — he — whether he explained to m — to us how these structures are formed in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="801">I-I don’t remember whether he explained, but I have a feeling that he did, but I’m not positive. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">And so, it was hours that we had to s — to spend in this <span class="INT_SPACE">alcove</span> , in the dark — semi-darkness. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">We could hear the dripping of the water in the back, as the water mixed with minerals, would drip down into a — a <span class="DLF">pond</span> at the bottom of the — of the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And then suddenly we hear somebody call my father, you know, Mr. Matsas, Mr. Matsas. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And we were frightened because we thought somebody discovered us. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And so we decided not to — to say anything, to keep quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">But the voice persisted, Mr. Matsas, Mr. Matsas, then he said I’m — this is Spyros. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Come out, come out, it’s safe, 1t’s calm, this 1s Spyros, Chiandafelis’(ph) son. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And — and I don’t remember whether we came out, or the people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> came in, I don’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">But later on my father said that he was afraid at first that they were going to throw a grenade, because at first we thought there were Germans, enemies. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">But what we discovered when we — we met the two people that September 14, 2010 Spyros had brought there, these were two other Jewish men who were seeking shelter, like we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">They were in Agios Vlassis and when the Germans advanced, at that point they left and they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> , and then they were told that this Jewish family up —there’s another family up in — hiding up higher in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agios Vlassis</span> and when the Germans advanced, at that point they left and they came to Psilovrahos, and then they were told that this Jewish family up —there’s another family up in — hiding up higher in the mountains. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">So now Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) had several people to feed every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">But we decided that the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> — the — the <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> was not safe either, so my father searched in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> <span class="FOREST">forest</span> for a secluded <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And so we decided to spend the day in this secluded <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and the nights at the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="816">QUESTION:  So was it — was it your father who decided that it was not a safe <span class="NPIP">place</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And why would he decide that, do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">ANSWER:  Because it was a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that was known by the villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">This is not a <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> , a remote <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> that nobody knows about. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">He felt that 1t was known and it’s best for the duration, you know, while the Germans were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> , because they did come —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  They came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="821">They came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">ANSWER:  — they did come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="823">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="824">ANSWER:  It is best for us to be 1n a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that nobody knew, except perhaps Spyros and his father.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="825">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">ANSWER:  And so I ev — again, I remember this secluded <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="827">It was — 1t was underneath a protruding rock, to protect us from the rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And so we — they gathered branches for <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> September 14, 2010 to — to create a camouflage the <span class="DLF">opening</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">And so again we huddled together, the four of US.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">QUESTION:  Was this another <span class="INT_SPACE">cave</span> , or this is actually <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">ANSWER:  It’s <span class="NPIP">outside</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="832">QUESTION:  It’s <span class="NPIP">outside</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="833">ANSWER:  It’s <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , but there’s a rock, a very large rock that protrudes, creating a <span class="DLF">roof</span> , and so we — we Sat underneath and we blocked the <span class="DLF">opening</span> with — with branches of fir <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> <span class="ENV_FEATURES">fir trees</span> and whatever other materials that we’re able to find. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And we stand — we actually stand seven or eight day — days.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">QUESTION:  So you wou — would you go back —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And — at night —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  — at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">At night we go back to Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and Spyros would give us some bread and olives or cheese for the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And at night he would prepare a meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">He acted like a waiter. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">He — his — Mr. Chiandafelis(ph) was very proud of his son, and Spyros sort of rose to the occasion, and he prepared bean soup, lentil soup or chickpea soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">That was the kind of food the villagers would eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">It would have meat perhaps once a week, or once every two weeks, if they could find it. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And then we would spend the night on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="843">There were several people now. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And then during the day, go back to that <span class="BUILDING">shelter</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="845">September 14, 2010</p>
<p>QUESTION:  A-An-And — and where did these men, these ex — th-the two — is it two or three —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yeah, there were — actually at one point there were five.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="846">QUESTION:  So where did they go during the day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="847">ANSWER:  They — two of them decided that it wasn’t safe for them to — to be even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> , maybe another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> is safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">But later on they returned, because the situation was not as good there as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So, eventually there were only three additional Jewish men that stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , plus the wife of one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">Her name was orea — Aureo(ph) Zeelavee(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="851">Now, these people were not ordinary people. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">One of them, Aron(ph) Romano(ph) was a ship owner, very wealthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And the other was an owner of a <span class="BUILDING">private bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And Aron(ph) Romano(ph) always carried a little briefcase, which we thought was probably — contained gold coins, but did not want to use them, didn’t want to reveal that he had gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">So he preferred to starve, because he didn’t have the resources that we had; sugar and soap and oil, to barter for other items to eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">QUESTION:  Did — did your parents barter with the person that — that had this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where you were staying in — in at nights, so they gave them —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, when we — you know, at the end of the eight days when — that was the period that the Germans stayed in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , my parents gave him sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">This is how we paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And he was a very hospitable person, a very, very hard life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="859">QUESTION:  It’s interesting, because everywhere you go, it appears as if people are willing to help.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="860">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">September 14, 2010</p>
<p>QUESTION:  And it — it’s — you’re not turned away by anybody.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="862">ANSWER:  True.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="863">QUESTION:  It’s —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  There is — that is the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">There was one family — actually he happened to be one of the wealthiest people, who were not very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">There was a time when he could have helped us tremendously to avoid experiencing literally starvation during the winter, because there was — well, I think I should tell you this part later in the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="866">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="867">ANSWER:  But — but he was the exception. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">Th-The villagers were very helpful, very helpful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">QUESTION:  So — but you had no idea that the Germans were only going to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> for eight days —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="870">QUESTION:  — clearly, cause they could have stayed for a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">ANSWER:  True, true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="872">QUESTION:  Right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="874">QUESTION:  But after eight days they left. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And who told you that they left, so you could get out? </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="877">ANSWER:  The — the driver of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mules</span> , who actually returned after he dropped us off, he returned to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , he came back to get us. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And so we knew that it was time to come September 14, 2010 back, that th-the — the — the Germans had left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="879">But at the same time, the rumor circulated that — that the Germans, who had actually occupied the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , had looted our <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that — you know, they looted Mr. Matsas’ <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , the Germans did. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">This was the rumor that circulated. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">And so when we returned, soon as we returned, before we even entered the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> — this is the story that I learned later on, the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> came and said, you know, the Germans occupied the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and they looted your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="882">They ate whatever you had, and they took away the remainder. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">And so we entered the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and everything was in disarray and all the food was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">And there was a substantial supply of food, you know, sacks of all sorts of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">And so w-we became — we panicked. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Especially my mother, what is going to happen, because this is the end of November, actually was probably already December and the winter is coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">The harvest is over, there’s no possibility of us buying food from the villagers or elsewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">So — so my father tried to calm her down, saying well, we’ll send a man down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , we have a lot of food in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> — End of Tape Four September 14, 2010 Beginning Tape Five</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Okay, so you come back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="889">QUESTION:  — and you find out that your stuff has been looted, and your mother is very upset.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="890">ANSWER:  Very upset, and winter 1s coming and sources of food are scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And my father tried to calm her down, that we will send a man down in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , in the — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> to get some food from the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="892">And this is something we did, but the man came back with one small ca — one can of oil, that was all he could bring, because he was bringing food supplies for his family, and that was the only additional weight for the mule to carry. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">But I was friends with the — the children of the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and they told me one day, oh — they were boasting, oh, we have so much food now. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">We have rice and beans, we have — we even have candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">We have things that we never had before. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And I — I was very impressed, and I reported this to my parents, you know, I said the — my friends, they told me they have all this good stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And immediately my parents suspected that the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was the one who looted the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and my father confronted him, and he denied that he — he took anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And my father persisted, and he had to accept to — the fact that — he had to admit that he did take a few things. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">He was afraid of my father talking about this to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and that he was going to be embarrassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And so he returned a few items. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">But my parents knew that he probably had a lot more, and was hidden somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">And so my father searched the — the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and other hidden — possible September 14, 2010 places where he could have hidden food, and sure enough they — he found a can of oil. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And oil was a real treasure, because was — this is olive oil, was very hard to find, very valuable, if you were going to use it as a commodity to exchange it for other kinds of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">So my parents were infuriated with this man because he — he really — he created the situation that we — we were trying to avoid, and that is lack of food in the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">So they considered bringing this matter to the <span class="BUILDING">people’s court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="906">There were people’s courts then, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> <span class="BUILDING">people’s courts</span> then, in villages. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">They were not official <span class="BUILDING">courts</span> , but they were — consisted of the elders of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and all sorts of ma — matters of — disputes were brought to the <span class="BUILDING">people’s court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And the <span class="BUILDING">people’s court</span> was actually very severe in punishments that — that they imposed on people. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">So my parents reconsidered that, because they were afraid he would be, who knows, imprisoned, or some very severe punishment; he had a young family, so they decided to drop the matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">And that they also didn’t want to draw attention to ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">So they dropped the matter, and at this point we had to leave that <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and we went to another <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to live in. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">This was very similar to the one we occupied the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">This one had two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">Kafeneio</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">café</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="914">And the other <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> was the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that we occupied, and th — and it had a <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">And so — so that was a big change, it was — we adjusted to it very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">But the main concern now was food. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">There was a family by the name Yovanos(ph) who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , but had come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> for the summer, and they stayed on because of the — the war situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">But they had decided to return to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="919">And they had a lot of wheat with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">So my father, being a <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> September 14, 2010 employee, he conducted a transaction not with checks, but with wheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">He told him, if you give us your wheat that is here, you can collect our wheat, which is stored in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">It was an exchange, and no wheat had to travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> or from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> , but it was a transaction that s-seemed reasonable to him, and he gave us a certain amount of wheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">But he had more wheat, but this other villager that was wealthy, who could have cooperated at this point and — and he could have made the Yovanos(ph) wheat available to us, he decided not to do that, and he kept the wheat for — for himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And that was a very callous thing to do, and he, years later when — after the war, the man recognized that he had done something very, very bad, and he came to my father and my parents and — and asked them for their forgiveness, because by — by not agreeing to make this wheat available to us, he made life absolutely horrible for the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">So — so th-that is the situation now, we are — we have very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">We do have this oil that the villager brings from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and this wheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Then my mother started exchanging sugar for a certain kind of cereal that is called Trachanas. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">It’s a —a coarsely ground wheat mixed with milk that is — that — that 1s in a dry state and when you add some milk, it expands, and it’s a very nutritious food and very filling. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">So — so this is what my mother started doing, exchanging sugar for — for Trachanas or corn meal. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Then some of the villagers would give us some eggs from the chickens, some milk, a piece of cheese. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">It was a very difficult situation and there’s winter approaching, it’s already winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">It 1s cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And so then, my mother, wh-who is a very resourceful person, she decided that — September 14, 2010 that she is going to barter clothing, our personal clothes, for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">And so she became a peddler, and she went with my 13 year old brother from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , exchanging clothing for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Or, she did other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">She knitted for people. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">She was — she had many skills. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">She knew how to make lace. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">An-And one — one thought came to her mind is that the girls in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , they want to prepare their dowry, and I can teach them how to — to knit. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">I di— can teach them how to embroider, how to make lace, and so — and said, there are a lot of girls in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> who would want this, and they would exchange my services for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">And the one family that I mentioned earlier, the Tsulamitsu(ph) family, they had seven daughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">They had prepare seven dowries. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">So she went to — started with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And she’d go there every day and help them, show them how to embroider, how to make lace and so on, in exchange for cheese or bread or whatever they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">So they ha — my parents had to start rationing the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">It was less and less every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And I — I remember it was winter, still winter, and there were some mulberry <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and fig <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mulberry trees</span> and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">fig trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="948">There are a lot of mulberry <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> and fig <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mulberry trees</span> and <span class="ENV_FEATURES">fig trees</span> in Greece. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And my mother said, you know, when these, you know, these fig <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> <span class="ENV_FEATURES">fig trees</span> , when spring and summer come, th-they’ll be full of figs. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And so I remember this game very vividly, you know, walking underneath those <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , waiting for someday to see figs up on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">QUESTION:  And that you remember as your own memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="952">ANSWER:  That yes, I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">In fact, at one point, it was in the summer when figs had formed, there was one fig <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> <span class="ENV_FEATURES">fig tree</span> that was growing on — on the edge of a <span class="DLF">retaining wall</span> , and September 14, 2010 I reached to — to get a fig, and I fell off the <span class="DLF">retaining wall</span> , and I — I remember that, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I didn’t get hurt, but —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Must have been a little scary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="955">ANSWER:  It was, it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">It was scary, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">But —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Do you remember being hungry?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="958">ANSWER:  Yes, I remember being hungry, and to this day, I cannot bear seeing people throw away food. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">You know for me food 1s something very, very valuable, and I’m very conscious — I’m very conscious of the waste that I see around me these days. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">But yes, hunger was pervasive. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">That’s all we could think of was in our em — our stomachs were empty, was — it was — we were very hungry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="962">QUESTION:  Now, were people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> also hungry, or they were less so than you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="963">ANSWER:  The villagers — well, you know, they — they had chickens, so they could get eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">They would slaughter a chicken here and there to get meat. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">They had goats for milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">But we had — didn’t have any of these animals, and they had stored food, as they always do, for the winter, like dry figs and walnuts, especially. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">Lentils and beans, dry beans. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">So poverty and hunger were pervasive, but we were — we were worse off than they were, because we didn’t have these resources that they were used to; the animals that provided them with nutritious food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="969">QUESTION:  And — and your parents didn’t have money either any more, an-and anyway, it was worthless. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">September 14, 2010</p>
<p>ANSWER:  The money was worthless, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">One wonderful thing happened during this period of — of, literally, starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">A group of partisans, or andartes, as they were known, they came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and they camped there, they — they settled there for 20 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">There were 60 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">I don’t know why they settled in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , but my parents recognized there was an opportunity for us to get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And it was either my father or brother who approached the captain of this band, and described our desperate situation and asked them if they could help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">And the captain agreed to give us the equivalent of two portions of a — of food for one partisan, for the four of us to share. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">And so my brother, when the — the bugle was sounded, he could go there with a pot, and they would give him the portion of — of a partisan, which was not very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">It was just corn soup and a piece of corn bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">But for us it was God sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">And he did that twice a day, and we would share the food, and — and that was for 20 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">That was quite a — a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">So that was the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">I don’t know at what point my parents — my mother decided that she should use — not — to sell not only our personal clothing, but also household items. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">I don’t know whether it was in that — in the wintertime or later on in the spring, but just all of a sudden she got this bright idea of — of using the cases — we had brought mattress cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">In <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> — in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> you protect everything you have, like <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> , you have to have a case for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> , to protect it from dust. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">And so we — when we came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , we brought these mattress cases with us, and we stuffed them with hay to make <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattresses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="987">So my mother, out of desperation she had this brilliant idea, said, I have these mattress cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">I September 14, 2010 can — I can use them to make pants for — for boys, or men. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">These — the villagers are dressed in rags. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">And — but these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress cases</span> , usually, they have very bright stripes, red stripes. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">So my father said, nobody is going to wear these ridiculous looking pants, with these bright stripes. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And then he thought further and said well, we — we can dye them, we can dye them brown. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And that was my father’s great opportunity to experiment and he — he said, we’ll gather shells of — walnut shells, and they were plentiful in the — in the — in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , and — and poppies. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">So this must have happened 1n the spring, early spring, and there are lots of poppies in — growing in — in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="995">So he made this concoction, boiled walnut shells with the poppies, creating this brown gooey material, and dipped these mattress cases when they came, and boiled them for a few minutes, and then they turned brown. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">Later on I found out that — that in colonial times they used walnuts to dye wool and — and fabric. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">So — so my mother made pants for — for boys, and then she used sheets, the sheets that we brought, to make shirts for men. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">And so she had all these wares to exchange for food, then she went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> with my brother, doing that. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">And she’d come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with — with cheese or bread or — everything was delicious to us, anything was delicious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1000">QUESTION:  And she did all of this by hand, because —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  — of course, she had nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">September 14, 2010</p>
<p>ANSWER:  — exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">E-Everything by hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">It was — she’d work long hours and in the daytime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">She had to do it in the daytime because one of the things we lost were candles, the candles that we brought. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And so it was winter, the days were short. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">But again my father, he invented something, he experimented with pieces of rubber from the tires, car tires, that the village cobbler was using to repair shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">He would use the material from tires as soles for shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">And so he collected scraps of rubber and burned them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">He — he mounted them with a — an old rusty can by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> and — and it burned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">It gave off light, but a horrible smell. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">The smell was absolutely horrible, but we had light at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">So — so he — he — both of my parents were very resourceful people, and they would always find the solution to — to a problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1013">QUESTION:  Do you think your mother worked more than your father in some respects, that she — she had a harder time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1014">ANSWER:  Yes, definitely, she — she worked very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And my father, he was — he had a sedentary job at the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> , so he wasn’t used to his long walks on rough terrain. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">So there were times he had to cross a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">creek</span> , or a — a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> [indecipherable] that was not — not a very deep <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , but he — he came down with aches on his legs, and then he had the dizzy spells. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">He had a few medical problems that had — had the — they were left unattended, although there were a couple of occasions when my mother and brother, they walked a long distance to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tatarna</span> that had a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for the partisans, and there was a doctor there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">They consulted with him, and the doctor gave them some medicine September 14, 2010 for my father, but somehow the villagers and us had managed to recover whatever ailments we had, on our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">So that was the situation in the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">It was a very desperate situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Then when spring came, there were — things were a little better because they gave us a short — a small plot to cultivate. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And then there were mulberries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">The mulberry <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mulberry trees</span> plentiful, which caused — and we lived on mulberry berries for a number of days until we developed stomach cramps and we realized we had to stop that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">But it was a very difficult period, and my mother, she bore the brunt of it, she really did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">That is the reason why, throughout this period she kept saying that I will go myself down to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and bring a horse-load of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">And — and there were groups of villagers that were going to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And she said, Ill just join one of them and go down into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">And my father and brother always say no, no, absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">And she would say why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">The villagers go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">And — and she — they would say, yeah, but you’re not an ordinary villager, you — you’re Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And she said, well, I have an I.D. card, because they — my parents had acquired I.D. cards issued by — by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">The priests of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> provided them with baptismal papers and so the papers were given to the German authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">The names had — were changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">And there was a picture and my — both my parents had an I.D. card with their picture and signed by German officials. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">But the — the ironic thing 1s that in the I.D., they do not ask for religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">It’s rather bizarre. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">Perhaps they didn’t want to raise suspicions that — because tha-that was one of the reasons why many Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , such as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> did not feel threatened, did not feel that they September 14, 2010 should leave, they should go into hiding, because the Germans were careful not to raise suspicions of what was awaiting them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">And — and in fact, the letters that we were receiving from my relatives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> were — were, you know, why don’t you come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , we have plenty of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">Why should you be starving up there? </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">And the same letter from Evianir(ph) Papadapoulos(ph), our — my father’s colleague, you know, come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , there is plenty of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">And there were many cases of Jews who returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">They had left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and gone to the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">And because nothing was happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , they returned, and they were eventually arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">But my — my father, my brother were — an-and my mother were determined to stay in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">So — but she, every time she saw a group of villagers going down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , she would say, all I have to do is just join them and — and our situation will improve.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1047">QUESTION:  So she became more optimistic at a certain point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1048">ANSWER:  She just was so desperate that she was going to defy any danger that she was going to face. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">And eventually, in March, when the snow melted and the conditions for travel were a little better, she — she joined one of these groups, and went down, started a long trek towards the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">She walked for 12 hours, and on homemade shoes because her — she had a pair of shoes that was threadbare, and then the other pair were — had high heels. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">You can see how — how unprepared we were for this kind of life, she brought shoes with high heels to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">And so she — she went with — with a group of villagers down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">This is very rough terrain, and all on foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">She walked for 12 hours, September 14, 2010 until she reached a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">I believe it was called Frangokisa(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">Frangokisa(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">And she had given — there was a young man, boy, who —to whom my mother had given a slice of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">She had — she brought two slices of bread, one for herself — well, for herself, both of them, but she was so tired, she asked him, would you let me ride the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mule</span> if I gave you a slice of bread? </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">And — and he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">And while they were doing this transaction, all of a sudden she hears her name, you know, Mrs. Matsas, Mrs. Matsas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">And that was — it turned out it was a friend of ours that they knew from Arta, and her husband was the math teacher of my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">What a coincidence, in this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wilderness</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">And her name was Zvolise(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">And she said, Mrs. Matsas, where are you going, why are you here, where you should be far away from here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">And went on to say, haven’t you heard, haven’t you heard what happened to your people? </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">And then she went on to say, you know, the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span> and Preveza and Ioannina have all been arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">The Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arta</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Preveza</span> are now housed in the Papapetrou tobacco warehouses and I don’t know where they took the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> <span class="BUILDING">Papapetrou tobacco warehouses</span> and I don’t know where they took the Jews of Ioannina. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And this 1s the first time that my mother learns of the fate of our relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">It was a very — a very painful, unbelievable news that she heard, 1t was — she was totally devastated, crushed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1070">QUESTION:  Let’s stop the tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">End of Tape Five September 14, 2010 Beginning Tape Six</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Okay, you — you wanted to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tartarna</span> , is that —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tartarna</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tartarna</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1072">QUESTION:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">T-Tartarna</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1073">ANSWER:  That was a very affluent <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and it had this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> for the partisans and then the villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">One of the — the doctors there at one point was Thanos(ph) Papatheodoro(ph), a very fine man, whose family also lived in the vicinity. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">And a — it’s just a si — it was a — quite a coincidence, my mother and brother met them, met the family and the doctor and there were three daughters, Hera, Ephemia(ph) and Irini(ph), or Nini(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">And the middle one, Ephemia(ph) became my best friend after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">We’re friends to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">And there were — they were — played a very important role in the family, in my development. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">They were a very cultured family, and it was through them that I was exposed to classical music and paintings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">Her father was an amateur painter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">A very refined person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">And — and this 1s the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> where my f— my brother was asked by the doctor — I don’t know whether it was Dr. Papatheodoro(ph) or Dr. Panopoulous(ph), the earlier doctor, asked my father to sing the ma — I’m sorry, my brother Mykas(ph), he was known as Mykas(ph) partisan songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">And my — my f — brother loved those partisan songs, they were in the <span class="DLF">air</span> , everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">They were very idealistic, describing a wonderful society that is going to be built after the war, a society that was free of ignorance and poverty and injustice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And all of these wonderful ideas appealed to him as September 14, 2010 a young person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">And so he — he learned all those wonderful songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">He sings them to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">I—I learned a few of them, but he was the one who — who sang them, and he had a beautiful voice, he still does. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">So now I will come back to the — to this encounter of my mother with Mrs. Volis(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">So Mrs. Volis(ph) tells her that you have to leave as soon as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">She talked to her husband, Mr. Volis(ph), and he suggested that — n-now my mother actually, even at this point, she said — she insisted that she go into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , in spite of all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">She said, we’re starving, we — we have to get some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">And so her husband recommended that she go to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamaroula</span> , where he has a kombarro(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">Kombarro(ph) is a godfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">And his name was Christos Zambarros(ph), and he — he was a teacher, and he said, he will help you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">So my mother started walking alone with this horrible knowledge of — of what had happened to our people, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamaroula</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">She recognizes the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where this man lived, knocks on the <span class="DLF">door</span> several time, they do not answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">Eventually they open the <span class="DLF">door</span> very cautiously, they let her in very quickly, and she — she told them who she was and who — who sent her to them, and she said, I’m looking for Christos Zambarros(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">These were the sisters of Christos, and they said — they were — they were frightened because the Germans has searched their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> moments before my mother arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">They took her to the <span class="DLF">window</span> and they said — pointed to the — to the square and said, look down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">You see, the Germans are still there and they’re still searching for people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">They were searching for partisans, because at this point the — the resistance had grown very strong and they September 14, 2010 were sabotaging the German advance and German actions; blowing <span class="DLF">bridges</span> and destroying <span class="DLF">roads</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And so they said, take this ker — they gave her a kerchief quickly, said put it on, and just pretend that you are our aunt from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Don’t say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">They sent for their brother and he came, and my mother explained to him what was ha — what happened, and begged him to — to go — I think — I think what happened — I don’t know — I’m not so sure at this point whether she had to go to their country home where a deaf mute aunt was guarding their <span class="BUILDING">store</span> <span class="BUILDING">country home</span> where a deaf mute aunt was guarding their store — the food supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">I don’t know where this meeting with Christos Zambarros(ph) took place, but he was very, very nice, and understood the situation, and he said, don’t worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">I will go down to — into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and I will do my best to bring a horse-load of — of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">So in the meantime, my mother was waiting in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> <span class="BUILDING">country home</span> with this deaf mute aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">This — <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamaroula</span> was very close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">And a few hours later he returned, but without a horse-load of food, and explained to my mother that the Germans were very watchful now, that they did not allow any food to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">And they had — they had executed resistance fighters already in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , about 200 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">So the situation had really become very hard, very tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">And they said, the only thing that I was able to bring from your friends, your neighbors, were tea, a bottle — a bottle of quinine tablets, and some matches. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">Very useful things, but not what we expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">So — so my mother took this me — these few items and started walking back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> — to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And at one point she — she met Pepola(ph) Hannah(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">He was a re — a Jewish resistance fighter, and he already knew September 14, 2010 what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">So they fell into each other’s arms and they cried and it was a very, very emotional experience for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">But she had to rush —I should tell you that there were a lot of Jewish young men that had joined the resistance up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">They have left their — their families to — to save themselves, and they joined the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">Unfortunately, a number of them, they joined the resistance, the — the andartes, but then they were afraid of reprisals by the Germans against their families, and so they returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">But a number of them stayed in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">So they had to rush to — Christos(ph) and my mother — th-the partisans did not allow anybody to walk after sundown, and it was close to sundown. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">So they climbed a <span class="DLF">hill</span> , and at the top of the <span class="DLF">hill</span> was a little <span class="BUILDING">chapel</span> , a little <span class="BUILDING">church</span> that Christos’ grandfather had built. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And so they spent the night there, and this was <span class="BUILDING">Saint Elias chapel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And then the next day they said goodbye, and there is my mother bearing this horrible news, alone, walking alone from this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamaroula</span> , all the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> , bearing the news alone, and crying all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">So when she came back, at that point my brother, my f— and my father were outdoors working on this plot of <span class="REGION">land</span> that they gave us to cultivate, and when they saw her coming, she was walking very slowly, they started to laugh, and they said, didn’t we tell you not to go? </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">You came back — she came back three days later and she — she was planning to stay for seven or eight days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">We told you not to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">And my mother was in terrible physical shape, bearing the horrible news and she said, don’t laugh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">Come in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and when I tell you what happened, you will cry with bitter September 14, 2010 tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">And so she told us, and we were — we were just devastated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">And I remember this scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">I had never, ever seen my mother in that state. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">Her eyes were — her — her feet were swollen, her face was swollen, her eyes were red, and she was physically exhausted and emotionally just absolutely drained. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">So we were just — just — just shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">It took us — took a long time for — to recover from this shock, and the only thing that sort of brought a ray of hope that sustained us was the possibility that they were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakéw</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , because that was the rumors that circulated when they deported the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> , that they were being relocated to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> to establish their own Jewish community, to be self-governed with their own mayor, to establish <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> , to be self-governed with their own mayor, to establish synagogues wherever they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">So we thought that th — these Jews as well, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , Arta and Preveza, that that was their destination. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">And you know, my parents said, we have to do something, but — but what can we do in — we’re in this remote <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , what can we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">But my father knew that there was a contingent of the British mission in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> in a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , because the British, throughout the war, were there helping the war effort behind the scenes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">Helping the resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">The British were there helping the resistance, even though later on, after the war, the British were instrumental in preventing communism from becoming established in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">But we — my father knew of this British mission, and he said we — we — we have to contact them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">We should write letters and we should send a letter to the — he said, the nations of the world have to know what’s happening, they have to do something to stop it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">We didn’t really know what was — you know, anything about September 14, 2010 the Final Solution or what diabolic plans of the Nazis were at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">So — so my father decided to write a letter addressed to the British government. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">And the letter, that was going to be delivered to my aunt and uncle, who resided in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , and they in turn would give the letter to the Greek government in exile, which was in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">It all sounds so naive now, but at the time it was a way of doing something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">And so sure enough, my father composed these letters and — and my mother and brother again, were to deliver these letters to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priantza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">They didn’t know where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priantza</span> was, they had to — to ask many people to find their way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priantza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">So they finally arrive in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priantza</span> and the — the British officials are willing to meet with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">And my mother, when she came back, she described that they — they walked into a large <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and they sat on two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> , my brother and — and her, and facing these British officers, and they told them what had happened, and they — they begged them to deliver these letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">And the British officers, they accepted the letters, but they didn’t sound very reassuring. </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">In fact, one of them said to my mother, you know — and I don’t know if it was his wife and children or — or some other relative, they — you know, my wife and children died in the bombing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and — and that — I have to bear that loss. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">So my mother was in tears because she felt they were not giving her any encouraging words. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And so they left with my brother and felt that this was a fruitless mission. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">I don’t know whether these letters were ever de-delivered to — to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">But one — one good thing that they discovered while in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priantza</span> , there were a lot of parachute drops that they were — th-they September 14, 2010 were delivering supplies to the British officers in the British mission, and — and so the villagers in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Priantza</span> had a lot of this material. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">So much of it they didn’t know what to do with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">And so when my mother discovered that this material was plentiful, she went from <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to <span class="BUILDING">house</span> asking for some of this parachute material, it’s like a dark, khaki kind of greenish fabric, and rope from the parachutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">And so when they returned <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after their mission, my brother came into the hou — <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with this big bundle of parachute material. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">And that was like gold for us, because my mother finally had fabric to sew dresses, blouses, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">But I — from what I recall, we did not dwell on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">Th- There weren’t many discussions about this between my parents, about the deportation of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">And — and th-the hope that we maintained throughout the war was that they were relocated to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and when the war is over, they will return. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">We were — my parents were primarily concerned with my grandparents, because they were in their late years, and they were very concerned about them, if they would be — they’II be able to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">So then — so my mother started working again, sewing the dresses and blouses and resuming her bartering activities with my brother, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">And that really was very, very helpful, because now it’s summertime, the villagers have more food to exchange for — for dresses, and so the situation, the food situation improved with the — with the weather, you know, spring and summer. </span><span class="sentence"

<p>QUESTION:  Let me ask you something, because was interesting, cause I — I can’t figure this out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">When you talked about your mother coming back and talking about your relatives, you yourself got really upset.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1171">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1172">QUESTION:  And I was trying to figure out whether you were upset because your mother was so distraught, because I-I didn’t know whether you knew these rela — whether you understood how bad the situation was, or whether you were shocked by your own mother, and still are shocked by that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1173">ANSWER:  Yes, it is — it’s really hard to distinguish, because I did have a recollection of my grandmother, as I said earlier, and all these cousins sitting on this —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1174">ANSWER:  — long <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , my grandmother serving rice pudding, rizogalo. </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">And — and — and so 1-it — this is very hard to distinguish, why I-I was very upset. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">Of course now, in retrospect, I was upset by the loss, the enormous loss that we — we suffered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">But at that point, it was my mother, because my mother was, for me, a security blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">And to see her in that state, it was very upsetting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">She was physically, and of course emotionally, a rag.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1180">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1181">ANSWER:  It was — it was a very difficult moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1182">QUESTION:  But there really was no knowledge of the deportations from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> , or you knew the deportations which — but the rumor was that they were relocated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">September 14, 2010</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1184">QUESTION:  Not that they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1185">ANSWER:  Right, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">When my father first learned about the deportations of the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> , which started I believe, in — in March of 1942 — was 40 —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Or maybe earlier?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1187">ANSWER:  — 40 — no, it was °42.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1188">QUESTION:  Was it °42?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1189">ANSWER:  I believe it was ’42. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">He — was 1n April, he asked — this was the time when he asked — went to the — the manager of the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> and asked for a leave absence — he had the permission to use his leave of absence any time it became necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">And my father told us later on the — the manager told him, you don’t really have to worry about anything, you are different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">In other words, the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> are more Jewish than you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">And — and it — and it was true that the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> , they spoke Ladino and they spoke French, but they did not have good grasp of the Greek language, because it was a very large community, with many educational institutions, and they could live isolated from the Greek Christian population. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">They were not assimilated the way the Jews are in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> , who — who are known as the Romaniote Jews, who spoke grew — Greek fluently, and could blend in with the Greek population very easily and just disappear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">So there was that perception that those — you are different from those Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">The fact of the matter is that — September 14, 2010</p>
<p>QUESTION:  It didn’t matter to the Nazis, did it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1197">ANSWER:  Didn’t matter to the Nazis, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">This was — this — the — the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> were descendants of the Jews that had come in 1492, expelled from <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> and they — they retained their language, while the Jews in the rest of there were known as Romaniote. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">They had settled there, some of them even before the Romans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And others came later on and they — they spoke Greek fluently, and —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Did the — do you think that that fact made it easier for you and your parents, your family to survive, because you could blend in wherever you were?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1201">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, wherever we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">For example, the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> , who were not seph — they — they were not Sephardim, strictly speaking, they were — they spoke Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">A number of them hid in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and circulated in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and they could blend in with the population, but the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salonika</span> had this added problem that hindered their —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Well, let me ask you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">The resistance movement must have known what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">But that — but whatever they knew did not get filtered to your family, or to the population, 1s — is that correct? </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">Or did they not know [indecipherable]</p>
<p>ANSWER:  What did they know about the di — I don’t know if they knew about the Final Solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">I know in — years later I— I knew — I learned that the British government and the American government knew as early as November 1942, of the Final Solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">But unfortunately — a-and — and — did not do anything to inform the Jews of what awaited them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">And that is the very painful thought that — that whatever was known by the author — September 14, 2010 American, British authorities was not disseminated on time for the Jews to — so survive, particularly the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , and particularly these Jews that were arrested sort of late in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">The arrests began for the Romaniote Jews in 1944, March 1944, and the war ended in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , October 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1211">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1212">ANSWER:  There was plenty of time for the Jews to be informed of what awaited them, and — and also <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> lended itself to — to the survival of the Jewish — first of all, there was a very strong resistance group, very well organized, in the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">The <span class="REGION">countryside</span> was free, it was called — it was free <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Well organized, and then, they operated within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">So, when we left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , it was October 1943, beginning of October, it was easy for anybody to go in and out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">It was October eighth, a few days after we left, when the Greek press published orders prohibiting the Jews from leaving their place of residence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">And if they were in another <span class="NPIP">location</span> , they were required to return to their place of residence. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">So, it was as late as the beginning of October, 1943, when you could move easily into the <span class="REGION">countryside</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1219">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Well, let’s stop the tape and change it, please. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">End of Tape Six September 14, 2010 Beginning Tape Seven</p>
<p>QUESTION:  D-Do you remember going to the <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> of <span class="BUILDING">krem</span> —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Kremasta.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1222">QUESTION:  Kremasta.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1223">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, I remember that very vividly, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1224">QUESTION:  Why did you go? </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">You went with your mother, 1s that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1226">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, the main reason I went — well, first of all I— I was always very anxious to accompany my mother on these many expeditions that she went with my brother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1227">QUESTION:  Cause you really didn’t like being without her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1228">ANSWER:  I didn’t like to be — she was a pillar of strength for me, and I —I felt lonely — oh, my father tried to entertain me and keep me busy, but I — I — and — and of course, for me it was a mystery, all these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">Cause they would come back with many stories to tell about oh, how a sheep was slaughtered, you know, because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> — it was done, and it was a big event, and the dogs were barking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">There were a lot of adventures that my brother and mother had on these expeditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And so I felt it was just — when my mother suggested that, I — I was thrilled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">I had some sort of a rash between my fingers, and — and my mother was really exhausted from her travels in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , and so she needed to recuperate somehow. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">So — and I was very thin, a-and the villagers had this belief that the <span class="BUILDING">spa</span> can cure anything, anything you had, whether it was a skin problem or orthopedic problem, whatever you had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">The <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kremasta</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">September 14, 2010 And so my mother one day, it was August, it was summer, she told me, you’re coming with me and it will be a nice <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we’ll be by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">And so we walked — we re — you walked to every <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you didn’t take a mule or anything like this, it wasn’t very far. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">And we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kremasta</span> , and this <span class="NPIP">place</span> was just teeming with people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">There were a lot of partisans, ardat — andartes, recuperating andartes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">Many of them were injured, and they were recuperating there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">There were villagers that had orthopedic problems, and they would — would — would come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kremasta</span> for the <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">The <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> were supposed to cure everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And my mother st — I remember her saying how people would come curled up in a basket on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mule</span> , take the <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> and then they would walk straight, you know, without the assistance of a cane or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">I mean, there were miraculous cures. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">So we — we shared a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with another woman and her child, and we started going into these <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> , they were constructed of cement, and they would get filled up with this water that was — smelled of sulfur, like rotten eggs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">And my mother kept saying, well this is very good, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">I couldn’t bear the smell — this is — this is very good for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">And th-the following day my fa — my brother joined us, and it was a sort of a nice, little vacation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">But unfortunately came to an abrupt end when the captain of the unit of the partisans that were stationed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kremasta</span> announced that th-the — first of all, the partisans had to go back to their units, wherever they belonged, and the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> — villagers had to go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because the Germans were advancing towards that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">So, people panicked, they immediately stopped their <span class="INT_SPACE">baths</span> and they started just a huge group of September 14, 2010 people, some on canes or sticks — not canes, but sticks, or — or mules and horses, going back to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And so when we reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> with my mother and brother, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> was in a state of excitement, because this time all of the villagers were going to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">They — with their animals, because the — at this point the Germans had become very aggressive towards the villagers, who at the beginning they were trying to appease, but now the villagers were supporting the resistance by providing them with shelter and food and so these — th-the Germans were carrying out retaliations against the villagers by executing them, or burning the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">So that was known, and so everybody was leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> with their animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">And my father was in the process of baking bread in the —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  In the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1254">ANSWER:  — his famous homemade <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">And there was no time for the bread to — to — to bake completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">This reminds me of the exodus from <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , with Moses. </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">And — and now we, again we pack as many things as we possibly could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">And this time we don’t have any mules to transport things, so we have to travel light, with one blanket and very few food supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">And so everybody is leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and this time we go to another — a <span class="NPIP">place</span> much higher than the earlier place of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chiandafelis</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">This <span class="NPIP">place</span> is called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">And so the entire <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , with their animals, they camp this plateau at the top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , which offered a very good vantage point view of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> below, not only <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> but the other surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">And so there we are, it’s August, the sun September 14, 2010 is burning, there’s no — they — we — we had brought the <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> , a small <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> full of water, but it was very quickly exhausted. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">The villagers knew of a — a spring, which my brother used to fill up the <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> again, but still not enough water. </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">The villagers, because they knew the terrain very well, and they were used to this rough terrain, they were able to discover other sources of water, but — but not us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">So my father actually had to — to go from <span class="BUILDING">villager</span> to <span class="BUILDING">villager</span> begging for a little bit of water to fill the <span class="BUILDING">canteen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">And I remember we were allowed only three gulps of water, you know, no more, because it had to last. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">The other problem was that we didn’t have — we brought only one blanket and it was very cold at night up at the top of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , so my father borrowed a blanket from one of the villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">And we decided — my parents decided that it would be best if we didn’t stay with the rest of the villagers, but went to a secluded <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so in case the Germans came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamaria</span> , they wouldn’t find us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">So again we were separated, we were separated from the rest of the villagers, and we found a secluded <span class="NPIP">place</span> and my mother or father or Mykas(ph) caught a goat, a stray goat, and we milked it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">So we had a little bit of milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">And so we — we stayed in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">Now, my mother was in — she was sick, she had fever, she was in very, very bad shape, because she had gone to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kremasta</span> to recuperate from her ordeals, and now, all of a sudden, she has to go up to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">And I — I remember this — my brother doesn’t remember this, but my — but I do — my mother saying, if the Germans come here, Mykas(ph) will take Ninetta, climb a rock and then a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">And Father should hide somewhere, and I will throw all of our September 14, 2010 belongings off this — on the — off the <span class="DLF">precipice</span> and I will get all — you know, fall off the <span class="DLF">precipice</span> as well, not to leave a trace of our presence there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">And for me, you know my mother, who was a pillar of strength, to say such thing was a very — a very shaky — shook me up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">And probably that’s the reason why I remember it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">So we — from — from this <span class="NPIP">location</span> , we were able to see fires being set on the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> below. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">And it was, you know, one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> after the other being set on fire, systematically. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">And they had reached our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> , and they began to burn those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">And — and it was — it was horrible, because these people were very poor to begin with, and now they’re losing — to lose their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and their <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , it — it was awful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">But then, suddenly, the fire stopped — the sa — fires in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">They had burned a few <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , but then the — the f— the fire stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">And we didn’t know what had happened, but later on — in fact, on my last visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> in 2005, some of the villagers told me what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">One of the villagers, his name was Bulumbashez(ph), a-an old, elderly person, became so infuriated with what was happening, that he defied the danger and he started coming down the m — the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> with his cane and he had binoculars, creating a lot of commotion as the rocks were tumbling down, and the two Germans with the torches that were setting the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on fire, they thought that the andartes were coming down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">An- And so they stopped and left. </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">And — and so this man really saved the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> from — from being burned to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">So it — there’s so many things that I learned afterwards, and at the time — September 14, 2010</p>
<p>QUESTION:  You didn’t know, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1288">ANSWER:  — they were happening, but we didn’t know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">For example, that explosion that we heard the first time that we had to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> at — at — that explosion, we have an explanation now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">We learned af-afterwards that the andartes in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agios Vlassis</span> where they were supposed to stop the advance of the Germans, recognized they didn’t have enough forces and so they set the <span class="BUILDING">ammunition depot</span> on fire, and so they ex — that was the source of the explosion.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1291">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1292">ANSWER:  But at the time, you hear sounds, we don’t where — what the cause of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1293">QUESTION:  Did your hand get better from even your brief time at the —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes, yes —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  They did get better.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1294">ANSWER: — yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">And my mother suffered of an ear infection, and that also got better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">I mean, there’s no doubt that these <span class="ENV_FEATURES">waters</span> had — and — and mud had medicinal —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1297">ANSWER:  — factors, but —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Do you remember having lice in your hair?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1342">ANSWER:  This is — this was done in the spring, so this is before going up to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamaria</span> —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  Uh-huh, okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1343">ANSWER:  — because we started cultivating this piece of <span class="REGION">land</span> in the s — in the spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">And so we had to extract the rocks and my brother had to carry manure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">That was another thing that — the villagers were — were willing to share whatever they had, so they had to share the ma-manure from their animals and my brother would carry it on her — his back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">And then my father didn’t know anything about gardening, but he learned quickly; he had to learn quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">And so we made a <span class="DLF">garden</span> , we planted onions and beans, maybe potatoes as well, I’m not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">So we did — we did get some — some food from the <span class="DLF">garden</span> , not much.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1362">ANSWER:  But my parents reaction was caution. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">They did not want to — to return right away, so they wanted to wait until we were certain that the Germans had retreated from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1364">QUESTION:  And did you notice? </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">I mean, you were six now.</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  Right, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">So when did they become certain, so that you could leave?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1370">ANSWER:  It was in October when the Germans had — news had reached <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> that the Germans had retreated, and there were probably villagers that had gone into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> and they witnessed that the —</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1371">ANSWER:  — Germans indeed had — had left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">And so we didn’t all leave together to return to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">First it was my father and mother that returned, because the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where we September 14, 2010 lived before the war was no longer available because the owner o-occupied the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">And so there was a housing shortage. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">There was always a housing shortage in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> because the people preferred to grow tobacco than build <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">There were always <span class="DLF">tobacco fields</span> everywhere, and it — it was a very big industry for Agrinion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">After the war, the family next door, that was their livelihood, planting and selling tobacco. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">So I know all about the process of growing tobacco, from beginning to end, except for smoking, I never smoked.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1383">ANSWER:  — and I stayed back, and he was supposed to be in charge of me and himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">And apparently we must have eaten something that was stale or spoiled, and we both became ill; very, very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">I-It was — you know, having survived the war, here is a situation where we could have lost our lives, had our parents not returned on time to — to rescue us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">Because I don’t think any of the neighbors knew of our situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">We — he — he — I don’t know what he cooked something that burned the pot, and then I don’t know what kind of food we ate, but we were very, very ill. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">But while my parents were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , they really had a hard time finding a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">And my mother in her memoirs describes their September 14, 2010 first night in — in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">There were — we really did not look like city people any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">My father had a long beard and he looked more like a partisan than a bank employee. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">And my mother was emaciated, and she was really transformed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">And they were in the main square, Letea(ph) Belu(ph) of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , and my mother describes how a friend of ours approached them cautiously, because they looked vaguely familiar, and as he got closer and closer, realized who they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">And he was overjoyed, because he was one of the Agrinion residents that witnessed the incarceration of the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Preveza</span> and Arta in the <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Papapetrou</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">And he probably thought that we also were among them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">So he was overjoyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">It was like he saw people who were resurrected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">And he ba — he asked them where do you plan to spend the night, and then he — he suggested that they spend the night in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of Mr. Zahoropoulos(ph), who was a bus driver, driving a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">And he is the one who, when my mother and my brother were leaving the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to go to the Bokoros house, he was on his way to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and he encountered us on the <span class="DLF">street</span> <span class="BUILDING">Bokoros house</span> , he was on his way to our house, and he encountered us on the street. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">And he said, oh, so Mrs. Matsas, I was just coming to your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to tell you that the Jews of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> have gone into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">See, he was — that was his route. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">He was just returning from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Athens</span> and wanted to inform my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1403">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1404">ANSWER:  So this is where my parents spent their first night back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , and my mother describes how hospitable people were, and they — they tried to do everything they could to make them feel comfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">So they had a hard time finding a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but eventually September 14, 2010 either Mrs. Huropoulos(ph) or someone else suggested to my parents that they go to an agency which was run by — by [indecipherable] who were really at this point sort of in control of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and they sent my parents to this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">And the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had two levels, we were going to occupy the lower level, with a very beautiful <span class="DLF">garden</span> , which we found out later that the Italians had constructed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">And when the landlady found out that we were Jewish, she immediately went to this <span class="BUILDING">agency</span> and said, why did you send me the Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">And the young woman there, the employee said — said, close your mouth, and what difference does it make whether you’re Christian or Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">They’re people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">And — and so she — she had to — to tolerate us.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1425">ANSWER:  And we recovered after a while, and —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  So that was okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1426">ANSWER:  — we were revived, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1427">QUESTION:  And so, did you then go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1428">ANSWER:  Yes, then my — I — I believe they sent my brother first, with — with Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) with a horse loa — load of food, because by then we had — having sold all these little dresses made out of the parachute, my mother had collected a lot of wheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">Because she would sell dresses to people who didn’t have wheat, but with a promise that when September 14, 2010 they harvest, they would — she would be paid at harvest time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">So now we have quite a bit of wheat to transport into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">So — so my brother and — and this Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) and the mule, or horse, I don’t know what it was, they come down into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">I — I- I’m — I’m glad that I— you asked me this question, because I didn’t say anything about Baba(ph) Yoros(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">There was a time, after the first time that — which was in November — when we had to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> and go to Chiandafelis’ <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">There was another time when we had to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">I don’t remember which month it was, but this time my father and Mykas(ph) decided to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , but my mother decided to stay, to guard whatever food we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">So my mother and I stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and we were joined by the wife of Mr. Lavee(ph), her name was [indecipherable], and she spoke German, and at one point she actually spoke with the Germans, and she claims that she protected the upper village of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Psilovrahos</span> from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">I don’t know, this is a story that I’m not very clear on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">But — so my mother and I slept in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and then early next morning we hear a knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">And we woke up, and there was Baba(ph) Yoros(ph), who was a neighbor, he was a retired policeman, and his son was a partisan. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">And Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) said to my mother, what are you doing here with your child? </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">If the Germans were to come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and — and take you and your child, I will never, ever forgive myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1442">And so when my mother heard that, she ha — didn’t have to hear anything more, she packed quickly and — and — and she packed more than — than she could carry, and she — in her memoir she says how she — she didn’t want to leave the September 14, 2010 — the things that she packed, which was food and — and a blanket, but at the same time she realized that she couldn’t carry it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1443">And at that point, Mrs. Tsulamitsu(ph), this — the — the mother of this — of the seven daughters who my mother was tutoring and knitting and crocheting and making lace, she appeared with her mule, and — and she saw my mother in — in this — in distress, and she said, oh don’t worry, I will carry all of your belongings. </span><span class="sentence" id="1444">And so, with her, we reached the upper village, and — and so this is how we stand this time when the — the Germans — that was their second foray into our <span class="REGION">region</span> , but this time they never reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">upper village</span> , and — and so this is how we stand this time when the — the Germans — that was their second foray into our region, but this time they never reached the village, and — and so — and so we all returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="1445">So this is Baba(ph) Yoros(ph) who played a significant part in — in our story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">As I said, th-the people really — they tried to — to help in any way they — they could, including th-the priest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">You know, we — we used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , first of all to — not to show that we were any different than the other villagers, and also to eat some food there, because whenever there was a — a memorial service, they would serve koliva, which is a mixture of boiled wheat and pomegranates, cinnamon and sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">It’s a very nutritious, delicious thing, but we’d go there and — and the relatives of the deceased would give everybody a handful of this and so there was another source of food for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">And the priest, I don’t remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1450">Papa Demetrius(ph), perhaps. </span><span class="sentence" id="1451">I don’t remember his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">He used to come to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> quite often, because he befriended my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">And my mother would always serve him coffee, which was a rare find, a ra — a re — a real treat for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">And he would chat with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">I don’t know what they talked about, but we went to — attended even Easter 100 September 14, 2010 services — Friday, Good Friday services. </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">And this is the ttme when — I learned later on, you know, after the war, I — I used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> with my friends a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">And so as I said earlier, I knew a lot more about the Christian religion than — than the Jewish religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">But on Fridays, when Jesus has been crucified and — and he’s dead, and the priest is supposed to exhort his flock to — to move them, that this wonderful human being sacrificed his — his life t-to save you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">He’s — and so he would — he — he — he would ha — he had to give a sermon to make people cry, especially the old women cry, and so he had to go on and on with the crucifixion and the pain that he suffered on the cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">And so Sunday they celebrated Easter, the resurrection, he came to our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and apologized to my parents for having to give this kind of sermon in front of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">So 1-it was, of course, appreciated by my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">He was a kind man, and he said, what can I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">I’m expected to do that, I’m expected to give this kind of sermon. </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">So now, go back to my brother and Baba(ph) Yoros(ph), they’re returning to the <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">And so my — my brother arrived with — with food, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">And then, after a few days, my parents and I came down into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1467">QUESTION:  What happened to the food in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1533">QUESTION:  No, they — September 14, 2010</p>
<p>ANSWER:  —no, not at all, they were actually very grateful, because my mother, when we returned to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , she — well, a few days after we returned, a trickling of survivors become — began to pass through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Agrinion</span> , and among them cousins who had joined the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">These are cousins that escaped in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Larisa(ph</span> ) and they joined the partisans and this is where they spent the war years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">And they were returning <span class="BUILDING">home</span> not knowing what happened to their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">They had absolutely no idea what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">So my mother, after these cousins returned, she decided to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1538">And at this point, we don’t know what has happened to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">This is early on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">Cause we didn’t find out what happened until — see, this is October 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="1541">We didn’t find out the war ended in the spring of °45, so we didn’t know what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="1542">So my mother decided to travel to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , and this is a heartbreaking experience for her because she goes into the <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> of her sisters, Eftyhia and Annetta(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">Th-They had — they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , they were married there, they had children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">And these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> are occupied by villagers who had — whose <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> had been devastated and they were coming into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">They had been devastated because of the civil war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">And there was nothing wrong with them occupying those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , but for — for — for my mother —</p>
<p>QUESTION:  It was hard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1547">ANSWER:  — it was really horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">She was knocking on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and — and they opened the <span class="DLF">door</span> and these strange faces were there, occupying her sisters’ <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">And my cousin Sam, he was one of the young men who escaped and joined the resistance — Sam 106 September 14, 2010 Meyer(ph) was his name, he was the son of my Aunt Rezina(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">Rezina(ph) was one of my father’s sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">He kept on trying to console my mother, saying, you have me, you have — Aunt Esther — Esthere(ph), you have me now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">I'll take care of you; you have me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">And he himself didn’t know where his family was, where his parents were. </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">Yet for — for my mother it was an absolutely horrible, horrible time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">So when she returned from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , she wanted to occupy herself with whatever she could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">Something that would take her out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">And so she — oh, she says in her memoirs that while she was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , she met a merchant who was smuggling fabrics from <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">And she discovered that the person who was providing him with the fabrics, was none else but her father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">Her father, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delvina(ph</span> ), in al — <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> where he still had his fabric store because wa — he was still a merchant, because the Jews of <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , even though they went into hiding, they were never deported, and so they all survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">And y — in fact, my grandparents never left the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delvina(ph</span> ) and the Germans occupied their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because it was a nice <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">So they were never — never disturbed by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">And there were other European Jews that had come to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> to survive, but so — so the smuggler gave the idea that it’s possible to — to get fabrics from <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">And in fact, she got some fabrics from him and told him, when you go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> , have my father pay you for the fabrics, because we didn’t have any money, either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">My father had not been paid in cash yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">There was no cash to be found, everything was bartering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">So this is how my mother started becoming a merchant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">And for her it was a lifesaving activity 107 September 14, 2010 because it brought her out of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with — had to trans — transactions with the public. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">And I remember, she also smoked at that time, which was not common for women to smoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">It was sort of — people looked down on this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1570">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1571">ANSWER:  But it was her state, psychological state was such that she probably experienced some relief smoking. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">So she found a shoemaker, not far from our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">And she noticed that there were some empty shelves there, and she said, do you mind if I bring some fabric here and I — I sell 1t to the customers? </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">And she said no, it’s okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">So this is where she started going into business, becoming a merchant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">And of course for her, becoming — being a merchant was second nature because she had learned all of this in her father’s <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">This didn’t last very long because the owner of the shoemaker’s store, she was — became angry when she discovered that he — he was subletting the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">And my mother didn’t want to make a fuss, so she removed the fabrics and she opened a small <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in another <span class="NPIP">location</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">But she was very, very successful, because — because of the civil war, these village women were coming from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> that were being devastated, into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">And they were too shy to go to a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> run by a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">They were too shy to talk with a man and transact business with — with — with a man, so they would flock to my mother, who was — then started dyeing less expensive fabrics. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">The fabrics that she brought from <span class="COUNTRY">Albania</span> were silk and really high class fabrics, which the villagers could not afford to buy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">So she started buying less expensive fabrics 108 September 14, 2010 and she started traveling by herself, which was quite daring for a woman at that time, to Patress(ph) another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , to buy supplies and sell them to the villagers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1584">So she was very, very successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1585">QUESTION:  So it was both a psychological move, and — and —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1586">QUESTION:  — a financial move as well, but that wasn’t —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1587">QUESTION:  — the major reason in the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1588">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, but in talking with my mother in later years, she told me how — how important it was for her to — to — to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1589">And my parents did not talk about — you know, throughout this period, until — until the war ended in Europe, we maintained hope that they were going to come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1590">We didn’t know about the camps of extermination, the Final Solution. </span><span class="sentence" id="1591">All of this was totally unknown to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1592">And it was in the spring of 1945 when survivors — survivors of concentration camps —</p>

<p>QUESTION:  Started coming down —</p>
<p>ANSWER:  — started trickling into the — int — in Greece. </span><span class="sentence" id="1593">And among them was my father’s brother, Mikhail(ph) or Michael Matsas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1594">He had lost his wife Rebecca, and his son. </span><span class="sentence" id="1595">And then there were first cousins; my cousin Nina, who still lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , who I saw on my last trip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1596">And then there was my cousin Eftyhia and Sandra. </span><span class="sentence" id="1597">So these were th 109September 14, 2010 — just a handful of people, handful of relatives who — who came back, and they tried to piece their lives together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1598">It was — 1t was a horrible time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1599">QUESTION:  When did you become conscious of what the — what was going on with these people, and what was going on in the world? </span><span class="sentence" id="1600">How — how old were you, do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1601">ANSWER:  I-I think it was when — when these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> survivors returned, I became conscious of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , not through the people themselves, because they never talked about their experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1602">They never talked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1603">Even my cousin Nina, who I saw in 2005, I — I had seen her many, many times before while I was living in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , but never dared ask a question, until on my last visit, two thou — in 2005, and that was the first time that she talked about it to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1604">This is a whole lifetime —</p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1609">QUESTION:  So, is your knowledge of the Holocaust not from personal exper — not from what people have said to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1610">ANSWER:  Exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1611">Not from survivors, relatives or friends who had survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1612">It was from other sources, not from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1613">And when I was visiting Nina, I remember she — I stayed with her f-for a number of days, and every morning she would serve breakfast, and I wanted to ask her — and every morning I’d say no, maybe she — she doesn’t want to talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1614">Until at one point, I don’t remember exactly how it came up, she said to me, you know, I was interviewed by Steven Spielberg’s project. </span><span class="sentence" id="1615">And — and I said, you did? </span><span class="sentence" id="1616">A-And — and — and I — and this was the first time that I realized that she had talked about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1617">This is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> now, there used to be — there used to be two <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1618">One was demolished and the adjacent <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , the Alliance Israélite Universelle was torn down, and they used that <span class="NPIP">spot</span> — land to build an apartment house for the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> who survived either by going up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> for the Jews from Ioannina who survived either by going up in the mountains, or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1619">And they live in that <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> on <span class="DLF">Josef Elijia Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1620">And that is the name of — of a Greek Jewish poet from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> , they named the <span class="DLF">street</span> after him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1621">But the — the horrible thing that I discovered on — after I made a tour of the — of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where my aunt — my cousin pointed out all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> of our relatives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1622">This September 14, 2010 is where Aunt ri— Annetta(ph) and Aunt Eftyhia lived, and where my grandparents lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1623">When I returned to the <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> , I saw this graffiti written in an ungrammatical way, saying, you die at 17 and we bury you at 70. </span><span class="sentence" id="1624">It was obviously an anti-Semitic graffiti on this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> that houses the remnants of that thriving community. </span><span class="sentence" id="1625">This is a community that numbered 2,000 — almost 2,000 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1626">An ancient community that had existed there for many, many centuries. </span><span class="sentence" id="1627">And there are th — a handful of people who live in this <span class="BUILDING">apartment house</span> with painful memories, and they have to — to read this every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1628">So I asked her, why don’t you — why don’t you hire somebody to erase it? </span><span class="sentence" id="1629">And said, we do it, and — and they come back, and they come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1630">I-It was — so my — my knowledge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> was not from our relatives that survived, yes.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1634">ANSWER:  They always talked about our adventure in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , always. </span><span class="sentence" id="1635">And they didn’t put it down on paper until they were in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1636">And it was really, as my father says in his memoirs, always the

awakened very early in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1651">It was an unusually cold day, it was actually snowing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1652">And — and they knocked the <span class="DLF">door</span> very early in the morning, 5:30 in the morning, people were still sleeping, and they told them, you have, you know, 60 minutes to pack and assemble in the sert — in a square by the — by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> , Pamvotis Lake, of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Pamvotis Lake</span> <span class="RIVER">Pamvotis Lake</span> , of Ioannina. </span><span class="sentence" id="1653">And this is what 113September 14, 2010 they did, and — and so my aunt — this 1s all totally unexpected, because up until that point, things were relatively calm in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and so this was an unsuspecting Jewish population that all of a sudden is rounded up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1654">And so my aunt approached the — this German officer, and said, we too? </span><span class="sentence" id="1655">You know, you lived with us, and I served you so many meals, we too? </span><span class="sentence" id="1656">He said, yes, you too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1657">And my uncle was still shaving, and it was a very — a horrible situa —a horrible scene that my mother described. </span><span class="sentence" id="1658">And now in retrospect, when I think — when I think of it, it’s very, very painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1659">Because I can — I can just picture now my grandparents being awakened early in the morning, in their later years 1n their lives; small children, pregnant women, they had to — to pack. </span><span class="sentence" id="1660">What — what could — they didn’t know what to pack, what to bri — they didn’t know where they were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="1661">And when I bring that scene in my mind, I — I can’t — it’s so painful, so painful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1662">And then my grandmother was a very kind person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1663">She was — she had many children and she was a self-trained midwife. </span><span class="sentence" id="1664">And she was a — and — and my grandfather had a lot of transactions with the villagers, because he used to buy milk from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1665">So she would — so they had a lot of people that they knew in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , and whenever a woman was expecting a child, they would always ask my mother — my grandmother to come and help her deliver the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1666">So my grandmother would always go around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> collecting baby clothes and food for — for the — the — the — the mother, the young mother and the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1667">And so she was that kind of person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1668">And why was she taken away”? </span><span class="sentence" id="1669">There was a — a book that someone wrote, I can’t remember her name right now, about the Jewish community of 114 September 14, 2010 Ioannina, and the deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1670">And she interviewed survivors that were brought in in the same — the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> with my grandmother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1671">No, actually the same — they were transported by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Larisa(ph</span> ), and from Larisa(ph) in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcars</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1672">And these women survived the concentration camps and they were interviewed by the author of this book, and they happened to be riding in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and they were interviewed by the author of this book, and they happened to be riding in the same boxcar. </span><span class="sentence" id="1673">And their — a relative of theirs was expecting a baby, and her mother-in-law was frantic, because what are we going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1674">How 1s the — the mother and the baby going to survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="1675">And — and they quoted my grandmother, saying, d-don’t worry, Ill deliver the baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="1676">I know all about babies, I’ll take care of you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1677">So I don’t know whether she delivered — whether she delivered the baby in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boxcar</span> , or when they arrived in the concentration camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="1678">But I do know that they were among the first people to — to go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , because they — they had — they — they took the elderly and the very young to the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1679">And so that was the end of these wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1680">It’s something [indecipherable] my brother and I live with this — this pain all our lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1681">And it’s just — there’s no — there’s just no answer, there’s — there’s no answer, and — and what makes it so painful for — for us 1s that there was a possibility they could have been s — they could have survived, they could have — it was late enough in the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1682">The <span class="REGION">countryside</span> was free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1683">The partisans were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1684">They could ha — <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> is a mountainous country, they could have left, they could have survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1685">And it didn’t happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1686">It — it’s a— we’ll — we’ll just never — we’ll never rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1687">I-It’s a pain we’ll never — always carry with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1688">When I went to 115 September 14, 2010 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> in 2005, I went to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , the only remaining <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> inside the — the <span class="DLF">walls</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> , th-the frourio, as they call it, that’s still standing there, and it was renovated thanks to the generosity of American women o-of that background. </span><span class="sentence" id="1689">And the <span class="DLF">walls</span> are lined with marble plaques on which the names of all the victims, all the people who were deported, on marble plaques with the day of — the date of their birth — the names and the date of their birth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1690">And th-the entire synagogue interior is — 1s covered with these plaques. </span><span class="sentence" id="1691">It was my Uncle Mikhail(ph) that the — a younger brother of my father, wa — he’s a survivor of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , he’s the one who collected all the information; the names, the occupations, date of births of all the people who perished, and then they etched their names in marble an-and — and there is a — it’s a—a good monument, you know, a way to remember them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1692">But it 1s — it is so painful to think — when I was in that <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , I — I had already learned a lot about the history of — of the community, and how rich their lives were, rich in — in long traditions, they — these unchanged traditions for hundreds of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1693">And it all perished overnight, literally overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1694">So with — with my aunt — with my cousin Nina, when we were in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and Mr. Samwheel(ph), who joined the partisans during the war, and this is how he survived, he joined them as a young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1695">Now, when I visited he was an elderly person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1696">But he — he had a beautiful voice, and he knew how to play a musical instrument. </span><span class="sentence" id="1697">And he took it upon himself to — to learn the liturgy, because he’s the one who condu — conducts services in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , only very few times, on like Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="1698">That is 116 September 14, 2010 when relatives and friends from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , they come to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1699">And so — so he — he chants the liturgy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1700">And while we were there, the three of us; my cousin Nina, a survivor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ; he, a partisan; and I, we recited Kaddish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1701">And it was the most memorable moment of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1702">And when I looked at the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , there were the names of our relatives, and — and cousins that were my age when they were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="1703">And I s-sort of —I—I-—TI appreciate life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1704">I’m very conscious that I was — I was just very, very, very lucky to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1705">So I’m — I’m one of the very few — among the very few Greek Jewish survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1706">And — and now I’m — we’re — I’m eternally grateful to whoever ever helped us to survive those terrible years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1707">And there were many people with small acts of — of — just a kind word here and there, or giving us a sip of water up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kamaria</span> , or — or the blanket, 1n spite of the lice, they — they shared everything they had, and I am — we’re the — eternally grateful t-to them an-and to the place of

<p>ANSWER:  No, not at all, 1t was — it is the loss that is so painful, the loss, and — and knowing that — that there’s nothing you can do, and — and it isn’t, you know, th — you know, people think that, you know, da — time will — will — will heal the wound, and that is not so. </span><span class="sentence" id="1717">Not for me.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1719">ANSWER:  Yes, I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1720">And — a-and it’s such an enormous loss. </span><span class="sentence" id="1721">And a-as — as I advance in years, all I can do, I feel, is talk — talk about it so that people will remember them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1722">They will have a memory of their names, at least, they existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1723">They were kind people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1724">So when my Aunt Rebecca, who was my father’s youngest sister, and she and her family survived in <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , see, because they lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> during the war, then after the [indecipherable] took over, and they had to — to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> , they came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1725">Well, she came to visit us about maybe 10 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1726">And she had left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ioannina</span> when she was 17 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1727">She got married to my Uncle Laylee(ph), and then they moved to — to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alexandria</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1728">So she would come back to visit her family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1729">So she retained that period of — of — of the family as though it was encased in amber. </span><span class="sentence" id="1730">I always thought of that, that — that 1t was like time stood still for her for that period. </span><span class="sentence" id="1731">And so she would — she had so many stories to tell about my father’s brothers and sister, about their wives, their — their families, all of their — their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1732">And she was a very articulate person and she loved to talk and I spent a lot of time with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1733">And then one day I realized, she 1s a treasure trove of information. </span><span class="sentence" id="1734">And so I asked her if she would be willing for me to interview her 118 September 14, 2010 using the family album. </span><span class="sentence" id="1735">And even though it was — I know it was painful for her to talk about her brothers and their families and her sister that perished, an-and her parents, she — she let me interview her. </span><span class="sentence" id="1736">I was not a professional interviewer, of course, but I — I really treasure the information that she gave me, because for a brief period of time, she brought these people to life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1737">And they were — they had their own achievements in life, their own disappointments and — and while in life perhaps they were ordinary people, having perished the way they did, they became extraordinary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1738">QUESTION:  Well, I know there’s much more to say, because your — your life went on for many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1739">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
