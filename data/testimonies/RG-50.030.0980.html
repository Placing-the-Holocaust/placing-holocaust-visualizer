<p><span class="sentence" id="5">QUESTION:  How did your parents meet? </span><span class="sentence" id="6">https://collections.ushmm.org August 15, 2018
ANSWER:  My parents met most likely if I can recall it well, in the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gora Kalwaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My mother was a teacher in nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And my father at that time was working in the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My father was a bachelor at that time and he had great ease of communication with people so I am not surprised that they met. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">They married in 1931. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I have beautiful picture showing their wedding and I was born four years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">My father was an accountant. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">He worked in the <span class="BUILDING">bank</span> for some time and also in <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And my mother was <span class="BUILDING">grammar school</span> teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">She was really gifted and praised by many parents for her exceptional human skills and ability to communicate with children and motivate children. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">So my first memories were started with the age about three. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">When my father was assigned a job, temporary job outside of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and I was sent to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and I already at that time had a good sense of humor. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">I was kind of the cracking jokes which I believe were told to me and then I think I remembered, but I’m not sure which 1s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My first major shocking experiences were related to the war because in 1939 at the beginning of September, when Germans were bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish cities</span> and they attacking <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from the west, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was attacked relatively early by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And although there was only 20 miles between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gora Kalwaria</span> , German bombers apparently made mistake and they were looking for military objects. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">They bombed the residential part of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , although there were <span class="BUILDING">military barracks</span> on the other end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">They were all made of bricks, covered with the yellow shingles made of clay. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">And from the <span class="DLF">air</span> they could have looked identical to the big hospital area which was next to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So they made a mistake and they dropped several bombs and one of them landed very near of my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where family of 11 people, escapees from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> were hiding in. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The escapees from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> when they thought, they saved their lives by running from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">However, German bomb dropped on that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> killed all of them, ten of them were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Only one person was saved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Before we get too far into your memories of the war and the beginning of the war, can you tell me more about your family background. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Your father’s family and where they came from as well as your mother’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">https://collections.ushmm.org August 15, 2018
ANSWER:  So starting with my father, my father’s family was -- it’s a long history cause one of my uncles was keeping the history of our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Unfortunately this book which was, hand written book, which was keeping notes was destroyed after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But what I remember was read to me was that Polish kings nominated in 17“ century, one of our ancestors, he was a general, Yosef Orlowski, as a commander of old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> which had the <span class="DLF">medieval walls</span> around it. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And then there was water around, I’m missing terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  The moat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">ANSWER:  The moat. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And this structure survived for several centuries, defending eastern territories of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> against the invasions of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tartars</span> and other armies which were trying to conquer Europe from east.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">QUESTION:  Was it in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gora Kalwaria</span> also? </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Or <span class="NPIP">outside</span> ?</span></p>

QUESTION:  Does your mother’s family have a colorful past just like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Just returning to my father, to my grandfathers. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">They came from an impoverished nobility of medium kind of the level they had their own coat of arms and everything was recorded and my uncle was keeping these records which unfortunately were destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">On my mother’s side. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">My mother came — my mother was raised on a small <span class="DLF">farm</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">She I would call it, she was a mountaineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">I was visiting this <span class="REGION">area</span> many times after the war and I met all her cousins. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Family was rather big and when my father was born he was the oldest. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">He had three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">My mother had one sister and four brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And there were two or three who died because of the illnesses of the time and bad medical care obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">So it was I would say strange combination of the history of these two families and I have to admit that my parents were not the best matched couple, as I see it, especially from the distance of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">However, I loved my both parents and when my father was arrested in 1943 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , he was traveling between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gora Kalwaria</span> often, and trading with different items. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">One of the most important items he was trading was golden coins because those who know life in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , during the occupation they would know that everybody was trading, even children. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">There was either barter or cash. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Everybody knew value of everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">All was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Germans absolutely didn’t allow trading unless it was sanctioned by them, by <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> which they would https://collections.ushmm.org August 15, 2018 approve and you have to be either confident or some other, doing some other functions, useful for Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Or the trades was illegal. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And, but everybody was really smuggling to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Jobs were very scarce. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Food was difficult to obtain. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Even if you had money, you couldn’t enter the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and buy what you wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">So my mother was an early — when my father was traveling between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gora Kalwaria</span> , my mother was very involved in social movements. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">My mother was involved in the trade union, the labor union, teachers labor union. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">She was demonstrating in 1937, 8, I know from her memories. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I was too small to remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">There were demonstrations for higher salaries, for better working conditions and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Partially successful. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">During the war my mother relatively quickly joined underground movement which was led by Polish government in exile in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">It was pro-western, it was called Armia Krajowa [ph] in English. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Actually 1t was AK in English was national army. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about your mother’s occupation as a teacher, what she taught and her role within the community?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Before war, my mother was teaching grades one to five, I believe, four or five. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And she was teaching all basic things. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Usually teachers on that level they didn’t have specialty so she was teaching history, geography, Polish language, less sciences. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">However, during the war, Germans- it was very lucky that in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there were somehow more liberal. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And we had two <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and each was — had classes one to seven. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">However, what I heard at the same time in different parts of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , they were allow, the classes were only from one to four. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">And obviously they would allow teaching history, geography, anything which would enlighten people. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They wanted Poles to just read and write and do the basic calculus. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They didn’t, the all <span class="BUILDING">middle schools</span> , all <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> were all forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">However, there was a lot of underground schooling. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">There were regular classes in people’s <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Some of them denounced, people were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Torture sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">There were all kind of sanctions, but many, many of the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> because of the solidarity between the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Everybody was interested having the children educated in spite of German restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Most of the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> I would say survived and there were all different levels. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Diplomas were given. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Exams were passed. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was just very normal and popular for -- and people were chipping in, in different ways. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">https://collections.ushmm.org August 15, 2018 For example, the parents of this — for example my mother was giving tutorials after the regular <span class="BUILDING">school</span> hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">There were, different kids are coming different days, different hours to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and my mom was teaching them, helping them to catch up to the level which was expected and there were either less talented or they had harder conditions at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Parents which are uneducated and they couldn’t help them with homework. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So my mother was fulfilling that role. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And well she was paid with real goods, usually food. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Like farmers cheese, homemade bread, eggs, carrots, onions, chickens sometime which was already plucked and ready to cook for soup or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So we are relatively, relatively and there were periods of time when there was shortage of food, where there were no tutorials and they depended on detention and what was happening <span class="NPIP">outside</span> where, especially at the beginning of the war and just before the end of war, when they were first uprising in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> and then Warsaw uprising of 1944 which were major upheaval for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and the near surroundings where we lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Kind of the beginning of the war, do you remember hearing about the war, hearing about the tensions between the Germans on the radio or the rise of anti-Semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">ANSWER:  We’re not allowed to have radios.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  Before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Before war, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Oh you’re talking about before war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">QUESTION:  Yeah did you have any sense that a war was coming before September first?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  Yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">There was some talks but most of the population were kept in the belief and that included Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I mean all citizens were kept under belief that 1f Germans attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">It was considered a, such a possibility, French and English are going to attack from the west because there were international agreements signed between the governments who were the western powers declare that if the <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is attacked they are going to attack as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">https://collections.ushmm.org August 15, 2018 However, what we learned later and obviously Hitler and his intelligence services had very good recognition of the mood and plans which French and German had and that’s what I learned was later obviously when I was four, five, six years old I didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But I knew it shortly after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Germans kept 92 percent of their armies in the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> and there were absolutely vulnerable from the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And Poles, Polish army and civilians were defending <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> for several weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="135"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was encircled by German army but there were organized resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">There was some w, ammunition and arms to protect <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> against the German army and it was very harrowing defense. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">However Germans had superiority in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They were bombing and they had superior <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> so in spite of the <span class="DLF">barricades</span> and all these fortifications which were built around the outskirts, on the outskirts of, of center of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , was conquered after several weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">QUESTION:  What was the response from your parents when the war began? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Was there any talk about fleeing the <span class="REGION">area</span> and going elsewhere?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Yes, it’s very good question because what happened here. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">After the first bombs were dropped on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gora Kalwaria</span> , there was real -- start to be just somewhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Germans are attacking them. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">They come here eventually or maybe Polish army would defend them. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Maybe French and Germans would attack from the west. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">The whole resistance was hinging on that promise cause otherwise <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> realized it, its population realized that they didn’t have any chance because the Germans who had huge amount of the very well, well trained, well equipped, quite modern arms, artillery, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">And so what happens here that my parents at the very beginning, after the first bombing, organized a group of families, perhaps was six, seven people in that group, plus the owner of the big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , Mr. Victor Balitzky was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">We packed our belongings within hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Packed our belongings on the top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and we are running towards <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to escape Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">On the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and <span class="DLF">roads</span> were narrow, whole <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">traffic</span> was mostly towards east. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And there were columns and columns. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Sometime <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> which were rarity. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Small <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> also rarity. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Mostly was <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> pulled by horses and people loading their belongings and there were columns as long as you can reach by eyesight. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">What German fire, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> were doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">They were running along, flying along these <span class="DLF">roads</span> and from the machine guns and also small bombs they were dropping on these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">convoys</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">So whatever it would have and we could distinguish between <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Polish aircraft</span> and https://collections.ushmm.org August 15, 2018 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German aircraft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">There was something different. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And my task on the top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was to look to the west and watch and listen for the sounds and I was the one who was bringing attention of the adults and then what people were doing, they running quickly to the left and the right side leaving <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> in the center of the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And they were hiding in between the potato or rye or wheat you know whatever we could — or <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> if it was nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And we’re sitting there waiting until they go away because they came for a couple of minutes and they were gone and then maybe next time, whether it will be the same day or maybe three times next day. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">It was nothing regular or they are not — unpredictable. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">This way we reached <span class="DLF">Russian borders</span> which was Soviet Union at that time but we called it Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And since Russians enter <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> from the east on September 17, we were at that time in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> already, not deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And we are ordered to go back towards west, towards <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> itself which was still <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> but it was already occupied by Russians that <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And not many people know that the <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> took more <span class="REGION">territory</span> in 1939 or September than Germans took before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">However the population density was much higher in the <span class="REGION">western territories</span> which were <span class="REGION">eastern territories</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">Also <span class="REGION">eastern territories</span> had much more minorities and so and <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> started to resettle Poles to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> , or to west, <span class="COUNTRY">Kazakhstan</span> , towards <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="169">They had to, were less organized than German but they had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> which were equipped with pig, with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> adapted to transport pigs. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And they were sent to which they later was called Kulaks, gulags.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  During this evacuation and when you were listening out for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> coming, do you remember being scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I mean weren’t you frightened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  Well scared is understatement. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I had you know my shorts full of almost and — you know I mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Did you comprehend it?</span></p>
