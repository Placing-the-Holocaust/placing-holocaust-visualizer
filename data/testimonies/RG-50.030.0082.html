<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  Well, life was pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Uh both my parents had businesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  What kind of business?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  My mother had a <span class="BUILDING">yard goods store</span> and my father was involved in several businesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">He uh supplied meat to the Russian...to the <span class="BUILDING">Polish garrison</span> at the <span class="DLF">Russian border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Uh I remember he also did some exporting of uh flax and uh oil, uh meat, and apples. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">I remember particularly the apples because he used to rent orchards and would sometimes take me to...when he went to oversee the orchards, take me along and uh one of the impressionable things that I remember is seeing the Russians play their harmonicas and uh dance in the evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  How...how did the Russians treat the Jews of your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  Well, they weren't weren't really Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Uh they were the what they call the White Russians, the Belaruskis. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Uh but my family had a pretty good relationship with them being in business. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Uh we had help in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that were gentiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Uh my brother's governess was a gentile woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I had a Jewish girl as my governess. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Uh there were laundresses that were non-Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I remember there were several help in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">So uh the relationship that my parents had with the community gentiles may have been a little bit different and maybe I had a different impression of it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">Uh I remember visiting with some of their acquaintances in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , and uh I remember some good times like horseback riding and playing with their children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  So life was was pretty good?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  And you had a large Jewish community there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Uh for a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , it was a pretty good sized Jewish community. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">Uh I remember it as being about twenty-five hundred Jewish people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Uh I don't know...some of the things I've read about a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , there were anywhere between four thousand...between twenty-five hundred and four thousand Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">QUESTION:  Did life revolve around uh Jewish observances and Jewish holidays for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Very much so. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Uh I think the whole Jewish community was steeped in Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">The holidays were of big importance. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Uh family gatherings, the shabbat...especially in our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Friday noon started shabbat. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Preparations were ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> was laid and the candlesticks were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and the hallahs were placed near the candlesticks and there was always Friday night dinner and uh shabbat, of course, no cooking was done and uh families gathered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  So you had a very tight-knit Jewish community in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Very much so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  Were you aware then as a young child and when life was still good, were you aware of any hint of anti-Semitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  I really can't recall any of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">If there was some, I guess either I was sheltered from it or just as any other child involved in her own things.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  You had a close relationship, as you said, with some of the the maids that worked in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or one maid in particular...
ANSWER:  Yes...yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  ... who was Catholic?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  I understand that uh that she had taken you to a <span class="BUILDING">Catholic church</span> at one time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I knew all the rituals. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">She used to...actually my parents from what my mother tells me, uh had forbidden her to take us to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , but she wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and uh, you know, in order to uh fulfill her own duties of taking care of us and my brother and I, actually different girl but uh they would steal off to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and take us with with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And I learned the ritual and it probably helped saved my life eventually.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  How how do you mean helped save your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  Well, when you go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and you observe and you know, a child does what everybody else does, so it came naturally to kneel and to cross yourself if if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  You found that you used those later on when you were fighting for survival?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Uh one particular time, one particular time specifically.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">QUESTION:  Can you tell me about that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">ANSWER:  Oh that was almost toward the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">Uh we were caught by the Germans and uh brought to our own <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> and uh after we were all housed in some <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> with no food and children went out to to try to scrounge food and so did I and one of the priests had given the children food including me and uh everybody knelt and thanked him and did the normal observances, and I knew how do to them properly too.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  Uh let me ask you a little bit more about your family life in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Uh tell me a little bit about your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I understand he was very active in the Jewish community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Uh he was active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="77">He was also uh very helpful to some of his uh gentile friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Uh whenever they were in need of money to help them through a period, he did buy from them and uh I guess he must have advanced them money. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">It...it stood us well in in our escaping from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">It probably also cost my brother's life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  How do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Well, my brother was uh left with a family to uh hide him and we are not sure exactly what transpired but uh he was turned over to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">The story we got is that uh this particular gentleman's mother-in-law was mad at him and uh told the Germans that he was hiding a Jewish child. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Whether that was the exact story or not, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">But uh, you know, we remembered the good things much quicker than the bad ones, and along the way when we escaped from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , uh we were helped by gentile friends of my father's.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  Uh how old...how old was your brother's name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">ANSWER:  My brother's name was Shlomo.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">QUESTION:  How old was Shlomo when he was killed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Uh three years younger than I, so in 1942 I guess he was about eight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="90">QUESTION:  Did your family ever find out any of the facts or any of the rumors or or any information involving him being turned over? </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Did he go to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Did you ever find out what actually happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  Oh no. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">None of the people in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">In uh our part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> uh there were no <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">There was no industry. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">There was no need for labor and uh what they basically did is they gathered the Jews and shot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">They eliminated everybody by the bullet and sometimes they'll...some horror stories were they left bodies on top of live people and they just suffocated. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Uh they also...a few people that I know that had managed to crawl out from under these dead bodies at night and get away.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  So the the Nazis would do a round-up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Do a round-up and uh shoot the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  Did your family find out what happened to the family who who sheltered your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="103">ANSWER:  Uh my mother went back after the war but uh (sigh) it's difficult to get the story straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">My brother's governess did go into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> immediately uh to find out what happened to him and the only thing she would tell my mother when she came back is that she was sure he was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">When we escaped from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and uh on the way, we stopped at at her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and uh she hid us...I don't remember for how long, whether it was hours or overnight and she went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to find out what happened to him and uh she told it was not safe for her to keep us because everybody had...knew the connection and she had just come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> inquiring about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">QUESTION:  I know that you were a small child at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">You must have some impressions of what it was like. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Uh how do you think that your mother was able to hear this and still go on in her own fight for survival for herself and for you and for the family? </span><span class="sentence" id="109">How...how did...
ANSWER:  Uh I know from...from my own feelings, the the desire to live and to protect someone is great and I think at that point it was a matter of protecting me and getting me through it that kept her going.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  Did it sharpen the will to live, knowing that that death could be so imminent?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  I think the will to live is something that does not need to be sharpened. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">I think it's there all the time and uh I think what happens is is they...the closer one feels that upon one's self, the the stronger the fight is. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I've watched friends that had cancer and passed away and their will to live was so strong that uh one does not believe that death is around the comer.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  How did it affect you and your own struggle as a little girl at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  I don't even know how to answer that. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">How it affected me? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">You just do the next thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">QUESTION:  So do you think that...of course, looking back because it would be hard to recall exactly what happened, but do you think that you you had to distance yourself or tuck it away in a part of your mind until you could deal with it and and just take the next step?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">ANSWER:  I don't even think one thinks. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">I think or at least I felt that uh when danger is there you try to to stay...stay alive, stay out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I know one particular circumstance where I lost my mother, got separated in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Didn't know where I was, nobody was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">All I could hear was the Germans calling and shooting, and at that point...
QUESTION:  Calling and shooting?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Calling. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Uh they knew people were around there. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We were in the partisans at that time already and they were calling out give yourself up and you will survive, and, of course, spraying bullets over the the <span class="REGION">area</span> , and I remember going out to the <span class="DLF">clearing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I forget...1t's better to get shot than be lost in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and going out to the <span class="REGION">area</span> and watching the bullets hit the dirt in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It sort of makes a little puff when it hits the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">dirt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Then I heard my mother calling me. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">It didn't take me (laughter) a split second to turn away and run, and that I remember very clearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">QUESTION:  When you thought about that decision, uh being lost and alone in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> or giving yourself up to be shot...
ANSWER:  No, not giving myself up. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Sooner be shot than give myself up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  So you were going to willingly walk into...
ANSWER:  Into a bullet...yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  And...and why? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Why...
ANSWER:  Uh you have to understand that at that point we were very much aware of what Germans did to Jews and even though at that point there were no Jews alive that we knew of in any of the surrounding <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , knowing that I'm Jewish and knowing what awaited me, don't you think it's easier to take a bullet at random than to have somebody point a gun between your eyes?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  Your family...you had a father and mother and a brother before the occupation and uh...
ANSWER:  There were uncles and aunts and grandparents...
QUESTION:  An extended family...
ANSWER:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="137">QUESTION:  Let me go back chronologically a little bit in time and talk about how there became an awareness in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> and in your family that the occupation was coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Not everybody believed it, is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="139">ANSWER:  Uh you mean the German occupation? </span><span class="sentence" id="140">Well, once uh the Germans started to fight the Poles, once they declared war on <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , we knew that the Germans would be coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Uh you must understand that we were already occupied by the Russian forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="142"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided and it wasn't a matter of, you know, will they come. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">It was a question of when they will come, how quickly they will come.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  Did your community...the Jews in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> ...you talked about toward the end knowing at that point what they did to Jews, but in the beginning you didn't really know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  Stories filtered down. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Uh stories filtered down about the fact that uh the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> were being taken out of their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Uh Jews from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> had run away uh because the Germans were coming in and occupying. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Uh some of them who came returned back because the conditions under the Russians were so bad too. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Uh my family especially since we were called bourgeois (ph), rich Jews or rich people period, uh we were packed and waiting to be taken to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="150">That's what they did with with the rich people, uh resettling them. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Probably would have been a blessing in disguise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  So you were a community knowing that your fate lay either in the hands of the Germans or the Russians, and at that point, did...was there an awareness of what would be better or what would be worse, what your...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  There was an awareness of oppression under the Germans, but I don't think anybody uh thought of being just shot to death, being eliminated or wiped off the face of the earth. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I don't think...as a child, of course, I didn't think about it, but I don't think the general community was prepared for the type of holocaust that that happened and remember something else...all that did not start until a little later. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> ... mean we had no knowledge of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  But there was a ghettoization (ph) process?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  Ghettoization process was not immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">That was oh several months later. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Uh the Germans came in in I think July and I know it was summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was not organizing...
QUESTION:  What year do you think that was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">That was 1941, and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> did not get established until the wintertime, so there were several months, maybe not...six months maybe, five months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">QUESTION:  In the time between the time the Germans came in and occupied and the actual ghettoization, what was the transformation that took place in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">ANSWER:  Well, everybody became aware of the fact that the Jews were not treated well. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Uh there were incidents of beatings. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Uh the next thing was the edict to wear the the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">No Jew was to uh venture out without the yellow star. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">If you were caught, they would get beaten. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">I don't recall but I think there were even a few instances where people were shot, Jewish people were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">One of the things that stands out in my mind is uh Russian prisoners of war that were driven through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they were in just terrible condition, uh without shoes, without proper clothing, hungry, looking dilapidated and drawn and went begging, of course, for food and water and if somebody attempted to give them...or couldn't hand it to them, throw toward them, uh anything, any food and if they caught it or even if they didn't, the Germans beat them and even shot several people if they lunged toward the crowd to receive some food, they shot them, and that was I think the first awareness of the brutality of those people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  Was there a systematic attempt to set apart and segregate and identify the Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">ANSWER:  Uh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">If a Jew had to wear the yellow star, he was set aside...he was set apart from the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">He was pointed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">To me it means being pointed to someone, there is a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Uh probably there must have been an accounting. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Uh I recall quite early where some of the...of our possessions were taken, uh valuables. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">The Germans uh had...I guess there was some sort of an organization that was uh formed from the Jews or appointed as a leader of the Jews and the the intermediary between the German command and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> where the Jewish community was taxed because I remember having to give up some valuables to help with the war effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  So the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was organized as a community and in that way was uh there was a liaison to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Is that how it worked?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> was always organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> has always had its own organization where if help was needed uh even to the point of sort of like a banking system, gmiluth chesed, where if someone uh found themself in dire need and needed money to to tide him over, he could go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and get some of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">Uh that establishment had existed and uh I don't recall whether the same person was head of the Jewish community when the Germans came in or whether somebody else was appointed, but there was a liaison.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  Do you remember when the edict went out that all Jews had to wear stars?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  I don't remember exactly when but within a short period afterwards, maybe within a month or six weeks.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="187">QUESTION:  Do you remember what it was like wearing the star?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="188">ANSWER:  Very much, because that was my first feeling of uh being singled out and pointed to. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">All of a sudden I was less, you know...living in a family that was quite comfortably uh situated financially and uh feeling...being the upper crust to becoming the the lower crust. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">All of a sudden wearing the Jewish star made me less of a...of an important person than I was before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="191">QUESTION:  Did your fellow villagers react in that manner to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="192">ANSWER:  Uh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">Remember it it wasn't really that small a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="194">There were probably about nine thousand, ten thousand inhabitants total, so if there were one-third of them Jewish, two thirds were not and in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> like that, of course, there are all kinds. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I remember very much being spit at. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I remember having to get off the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> when I walked on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> and a non-Jew was approaching. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">Part of the the prescribed new behavior was that one had to accommodate the non-Jewish person.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="198">QUESTION:  So before this process, you didn't feel anti-Semitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">ANSWER:  Not as such because being within the family and the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , uh you know, if I ventured out into the non-Jewish community, 1t was normally my parents' acquaintances. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">Uh with my parents having businesses and especially my mother had probably the largest <span class="BUILDING">yard goods store</span> in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , there were always non-Jewish people coming and going and the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was uh in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">It was sort of connected.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  And now things were very different, now that you were set apart and identified as a Jew?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="203">ANSWER:  Uh it started actually when the Russians came in, because all of a sudden we were identified as bourgeois. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">The <span class="BUILDING">store</span> was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">Our circumstances were quite different, so it was sort of a degrading of circumstances starting with the Russian occupation, and that proceeded into the German occupation, the conditions constantly getting worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  Let me ask about some of the religious and cultural observances that were common in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and how you kept them under the occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Now your father was a Zionist, correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="208">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="209">QUESTION:  And how did he practice or promote that Zionism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="210">ANSWER:  I know that I was taught Hebrew at an early age. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I know I spoke fluent Hebrew and remembered enough of it that after liberation, uh I met up with Isra...actually when we came across the <span class="DLF">border</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , we met the Hebrew brigade and uh I had no difficulty communicating.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="212">QUESTION:  Were any other ways in which your father observed Zionist teachings and...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">ANSWER:  Well, I think probably he always contributed to the Jewish community and uh to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">I remember the the little box, tzedoka, the discussions about <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Uh some cousins had uh gone to what was called a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , preparing to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , uh kind of getting training, mostly agricultural training and living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">communities</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Uh I remember the hallutz (ph) movement, patriotic songs, uh learning about some of the the heroes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">QUESTION:  And there were also Jewish Socialists.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="218">ANSWER:  I'm sure there were. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I know that I had a cousin who had uh gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> uh in the revolutionary period. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">We never heard from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">All I did was see pictures of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">I never actually knew him, but that was my uh father's sister's son.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="223">QUESTION:  Was it hard to maintain Jewish observances after the Germans came and how did you do that specifically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  Uh much of it...the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> ceased to exist as they did before. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">Uh much of it was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I remember a seder. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I also remember wall to wall <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> and that the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> was Set up and everybody sat on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , because that was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , probably the the last seder in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And uh I remember that it was conducted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">QUESTION:  What do you remember about that seder?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="230">ANSWER:  Probably for the first time in my life, I observed the baking of the matzoh and it was done at night in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">You know, couldn't remember before now that...you kind of jogged my memory to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">I remember the baking of the matzoh at one of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> where they uh...the baking was set up and I remember everything being blacked out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="233">QUESTION:  Now you were in hiding at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">That was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="236">QUESTION:  OK.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="237">ANSWER:  I'm talking about during the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">QUESTION:  You had to hide the fact that you were observing passover?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">ANSWER:  The fact...yes, that matzoh was being baked for passover.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="240">QUESTION:  So it had been...the the observance of Jewish holidays had been outlawed at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I don't know why else it had to be done at night and in hiding.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="243">QUESTION:  And shabbot?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER:  Shabbot was a a normal observance. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Nobody worked on shabbot. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">If any Jew worked on shabbot, he was looked down upon and pointed to by the rest of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">QUESTION:  Were you allowed to observe shabbot or was that also something that had to be done in hiding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="248">ANSWER:  I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I am sure that the Germans took all the people to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">Uh a certain segment of the population from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was taken to work either cleaning or doing whatever the Germans needed done...laundry or uh some of them were shoemakers or uh tailors. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">Those fared a little better because they were needed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">QUESTION:  Going back to that passover seder for a minute, uh do you remember what it meant to you as a child observing how life had changed from one passover to the other? </span><span class="sentence" id="253">How it...what did it mean to you that that Jews were gathered, not enough to eat, in a crowded situation and and trying to maintain that that observance?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">ANSWER:  I'm not quite sure, I'll tell you the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">I just...you know, it's a memory of what the seder was like, a memory of the fact that uh you were not with just family. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Actually not with family, only the people that lived in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">Some were family, some not. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Uh it was more what I remember 1s the fact that 1t was different.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="259">QUESTION:  Would you...do you think that it had special meaning then or only when you look back on it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">ANSWER:  I think at this point only when I look back at it. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">It was...it was so long ago I don't really remember what my feelings were. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Just the fact that they were strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">It wasn't the way it used to be.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  What else did you remember how long a period of time, from the beginning of the ghettoization to to that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  Uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> started in the wintertime and it was summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I know it was after Shavuot and it was around May that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was liquidated, so I would say probably six months.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">So this was a process that took six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">What happened 1n that period of time? </span><span class="sentence" id="270">How was twenty-five thousand people or three thousand people...
ANSWER:  Twenty-five hundred.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  Twenty-five hundred...excuse me...liquidated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  Well, you...we had certain small groups that were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Uh I remember stories that uh people were made to dig their own <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">Uh in front of the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , there was a big <span class="DLF">pit</span> ...I guess a <span class="DLF">sand pit</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I just remember there was a <span class="DLF">pit</span> and from what I heard that is where the majority of the people were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">Uh I know...I remember hearing that some of the people...uh Jews had to to throw dirt or sand or whatever over the bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Uh those people had been at the edge of that <span class="DLF">pit</span> and had come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Uh there were small groups that were killed and then there were what they called uh reducing the numbers, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  What did that...what did that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER:  They had taken away the the the uh the less able and uh the smallest and uh shot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">It sort of was a a process that they went through by eliminating people and making the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> smaller, easier to control.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">QUESTION:  How were Jews identified in the various phases to be executed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="283">ANSWER:  I think it was who was available, who they could get hold of and uh normally the strongest ones were the ones that survived because they could use them. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">The Germans uh needed some people to do their chores and kept up...kept out the the most able. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Uh every time that the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> became aware that uh there was going to be some uh some cleaning out, that they were going to to take some of the people away, whoever could hid and if one was in hiding, if they didn't find them, managed to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Actually we survived because we were in hiding...hiding uh at the time when the final phase of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was liquidated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">QUESTION:  When...approaching the final phase, what was the the mentality? </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Was there an awareness that eventually your number would be up, that eventually in not too long a period of time that that it would be your turn to be eliminated and and was there fear? </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Was there uh...was there an awareness that you had to get out? </span><span class="sentence" id="290">What was the mentality like at the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  Well, of course there was awareness and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Uh a few people did manage to get out and uh the reprisals were very very high and that probably kept other people from from leaving if they could get out, because the first ones that would uh be used in the reprisal would be the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I guess it's very difficult for a person to to save his life knowing that his family is going to to pay for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  Were you scared? </span><span class="sentence" id="295">You were a little girl at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">How much of this were you...did you know and and and how did you deal with it? </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Were you frightened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">ANSWER:  Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Uh it's fear but it's almost an accepted fear at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">You do things because you have to do them. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I remember incidents where...I'd be jumping the gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We escaped from one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we were in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and we knew that there was going to be a reduction again and a cousin had a <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> and the Germans had told him that that night he was to spend at his <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> and he took me along with him and I wasn't allowed to walk with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I had to follow at a distance, and he hid me and uh we went up to the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and watched what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">QUESTION:  What was going on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="306">ANSWER:  Well, we saw the Jews being gathered into one open <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">We watched them being separated, a group here, a group there, examining their papers and some taken away and some returned back to the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  What happened to the ones that were taken away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="309">ANSWER:  They were shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="310">QUESTION:  Did you see this happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I don't know whether he did or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">He survived, by the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  Your cousin?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">He survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">He was an excellent photographer, and the German made...the Germans made full use of his uh talents.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="318">QUESTION:  As people were being reduced or eliminated in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , first of all, did you know some of the people and when did it start to encroach on the people that you knew, your neighbors, the...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="319">ANSWER:  Actually nobody from my family uh was eliminated in in the reduction of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Everybody lived to the final liquidation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION:  Let me ask you about when the decision was made by your family to go into hiding?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  It wasn't a matter of decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was surrounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Word had it that uh something was going to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Nobody ever knew how much of what would happen, and when that was announced uh my family had built a <span class="DLF">double wall</span> in a uh...1t was a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Of course, it was used for <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> at that point. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> somehow was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was around the <span class="DLF">synagogue courtyards</span> because that was the concentration of Jews and along the <span class="DLF">street</span> so that it had some sort of division, <span class="DLF">dividing line</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> on our side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> , all of them had uh enclosed <span class="DLF">courtyards</span> to the <span class="DLF">street</span> , so it was easy to close off that particular <span class="NPIP">part</span> , so in the <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> uh there was a <span class="DLF">double wall</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">QUESTION:  Now when you say a <span class="DLF">double wall</span> , how big a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">ANSWER:  How big a <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> ...probably just a matter of a couple of...I'd say about two and a half, three feet wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">QUESTION:  And your family hid there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="332">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Not just my family...quite a number of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Whoever could get in. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">It wasn't a matter of...when that was announced and when the Germans started to knock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> , it's it's who could make it, and at a certain point, the <span class="DLF">door</span> was closed and that was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="336">QUESTION:  So one day the Germans came and knocked on the <span class="DLF">door</span> and your family...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="337">ANSWER:  Uh one morning, word had it that something was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">I really can't recall whether we went in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Sometimes we would sleep in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">If there was any kind of word that something was going to happen, we would not spend the night in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> but in this <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="341">QUESTION:  How long did you live or hide in this <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  At that particular time, I think it was about a week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="343">QUESTION:  You spent a week.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="346">ANSWER:  I'm aware of my mother and myself and my brother, my grandmother and some other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Just how many other people, I don't know because it seemed like whenever somebody went out, they just didn't return. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">If somebody went out to investigate...uh I know that my grandmother was caught and of course she would not tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">She just said she was the only one and she hid and she would not point out as to where we were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="350">QUESTION:  How do you remember that your grandmother was caught?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">ANSWER:  Uh I remember because that...it was a very traumatic time. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Particularly remember my mother trying to to reach for her and trying to protect us at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  Now your mother was in this <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  And you grandmother went out and and encountered German soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">ANSWER:  My...no. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">What happened was is uh we could hear quite a bit with what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">We couldn't see. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">There was a lot of shooting going on and uh then it became quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">We did not have any more bread or water and how long can you stay in a <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Also we could hear voices and we could hear the discussion of the the gentiles. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">Everybody came to loot and I guess our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in particular. (</span><span class="sentence" id="363">Laughter) And uh I remember at some point I guess it was felt that uh it's time to to get out and and go. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Uh one of the dangers was that...I don't recall exactly what happened but it seemed to me that my mother overheard somebody saying that uh everything is, you know, is...everybody's gone from here and it's time to to occupy the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , to take the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Then it would be very difficult to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And the decision, I guess, was made to try to get out and also there was more than one <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Normally there were several so what we tried to do is get out from that one and get into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">There was another hiding place in a <span class="INT_SPACE">pantry</span> under the ground...under the <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> and we were going there and I don't recall whether my grandmother was first or last but I know...I remember hearing her.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="391">ANSWER:  I don't even remember the circumstances. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">I just know he was...he was not with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="393">QUESTION:  But at one point you became aware that your family...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="394">ANSWER:  Uh the...(sigh)...I don't know how to explain it to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">When something like this happens, in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> you're not really sure of what the circumstances were. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">It's not...it's not a normal occurrence. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">All I know is that the family became smaller. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">At that point frankly it's it's just a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">That particular incident is a nightmare. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">The things that I remember is even when we were running out from the second <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , crawling over bodies, the things that stand out in my mind is that we crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , which was one of the boundaries of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , after crawling over bodies and hiding in the shadows and uh encountering two men with rifles, and my mother had some valuables on her and she said look, I I can make you rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">Put out your hands and I'll give it all to you, and they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">They slung their rifles over their shoulder, and within the period of time that they put away their possess...our possessions I should say, not their possessions, uh we managed to escape so it was known that we were someplace around and I don't know if they recognized my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">They could easily figure out where we were going to, who the friends were and which particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> we would go to. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">I remember hiding uh in a <span class="BUILDING">bathhouse</span> in a nearby <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and I remember a man coming and telling us that every...they know that you're still alive and that you're around here someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">You'd better run. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">You better hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">That was after my mother had left my brother with my father's very good friend to hide him. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">She took me to this particular man's sister, and by the time we got there...remember we can only do it at night, not during the daytime...and don't ask me whether it was the same night or the next night. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">Uh by the time she brought me there, uh this man told my mother that he had just come back and noticed that my father was...my...sorry...my brother was caught by the Germans and that we better run from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> because we're not safe here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">QUESTION:  So at this point, 1t was just you and your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">ANSWER:  It was just my mother and I.
QUESTION:  And where did you run to?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  Well, the next <span class="NPIP">place</span> ...well, we hid. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">I remember hiding in...the wheat grows pretty high in our part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and I remember hiding in the wheat, in the <span class="DLF">field</span> , and I remember gentiles passing, farmers passing and talking about what was happening in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the fact that all the Jews were were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">They really did a clean-up job. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Uh at night we managed to get over to my brother's governess' <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and we must have hid the night someplace nearby because probably the next night we got news that my brother was no longer alive and ventured further.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="416">QUESTION:  So that night before you had seen your brother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">We were all three of us together until my mother left me in this <span class="BUILDING">bath house</span> and took my brother to place him into hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I guess she figured she'll place him and place me someplace safe and then she'll fend for herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  So you were left alone for a time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  I was...yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Actually no...there were two other children that somehow managed to to get out with us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="424">QUESTION:  How old were you then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="425">ANSWER:  It's easy to figure out. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">It was 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">The win...the...not...not quite twelve. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Eleven years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  When your mother left you...
ANSWER:  Wait a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">It was 1943, so I was twelve years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  When you were left alone for that period of time, what was your reaction? </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Were you...did you feel that you were strong? </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Were you especially frightened do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="434">ANSWER:  Just waiting and and hoping my mother comes back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="435">QUESTION:  Were you not sure that that would happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="436">ANSWER:  I don't think I was sure of anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">I think one becomes numb. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">You...you don't feel a thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">You just...you just take it as it comes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="440">QUESTION:  So from there after your mother and you received this news about your brother, where did you go next?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="441">ANSWER:  Next we went to another gentile family. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Again my mother started to choose very, very carefully as to where to go, who she would think would be the the least uh belligerent and we went to this <span class="BUILDING">woman's house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Uh she was a widow and my father had helped her out greatly when her husband passed away and my mother felt that uh that was a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, and uh when we got there uh she wasn't <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Her daughter was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and her daughter must have been just about a couple of years older than I and uh the daughter knew us very well too, and she hid us and uh I remember the the center of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ...most of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> had like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fireplace</span> , an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Everybody had to bake bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It was like an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> and to keep warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">It was built out of bricks and it had sort of like a uh a a level area. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">A lot of the uh farmers would sleep there in the wintertime because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">oven</span> would be heated up, so she put us there and normally there was some sort of a curtain that was drawn across it, so that's where she put us and that's where we stayed and uh the mother came back and as in many <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , the big pastime was to get together and to talk and uh we were up there and this woman crawled up and sat down right in front of the curtain and talked to the people that were sitting on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> and they were discussing about what happened in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  And she didn't know you were in there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  Oh, she knew we were there because when she came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> her daughter had informed her that uh we had come and she put us...where she put us to hide us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="451">QUESTION:  How long did you stay there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="452">ANSWER:  We stayed there probably a couple of nights, until things quieted down because uh this woman had sent a son...she had two sons and a daughter and we actually saw her after the war too. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">Uh we know she left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> because my mother corresponded with her and after a while the letters just came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Uh she was actually of French extraction. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">She married her husband who was Polish and was living there, and she had talked about going back to her people anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">So I suppose she must have gone back, but what she did was is she uh sent us by horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , giv...giving us her clothing, her documents, her daughter's documents, and sent her son with us to take us to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Uh actually she scouted. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">Uh my mother told her who she wanted...where...where the next stop could be for us and she had gotten in touch with those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">She went over there and just spoke and she says yes, it's safe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">QUESTION:  What would have happened to her if it had been found out that she did all that to hide you and save your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="461">ANSWER:  Our lives and hers would have been ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="462">QUESTION:  Why do you think she she did that, that she risked her life...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="463">ANSWER:  She was...she was a righteous person. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">She was a good person. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">That's why I said that thank God that there are some people who did not side with the Germans and who had a conscious and uh who had love of humanity and and wanted to help people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  Were those people...those righteous people...were they extraordinary? </span><span class="sentence" id="467">Were they few? </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Uh how did you know or did you know who would would would put their own lives on the <span class="DLF">line</span> to help you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="469">ANSWER:  You didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">You didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">It was a matter of I guess luck.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  So these were people that you had known before...
ANSWER:  Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  ...but one may turn you in and the other may save your life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="474">ANSWER:  Correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="475">QUESTION:  You said that your mother chose very carefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Do you think she sensed about this one woman that that this would be...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="477">ANSWER:  Well, the circumstances were such that she figured if anybody had any kind of a debt to pay and they were...and they were good, they would do it, if they would turn us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">At that point this particular woman had nothing to gain by turning us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Uh the next family...
QUESTION:  But she had a lot to loose by helping you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="480">ANSWER:  She had a lot to loose. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">It was just that uh I remember her telling my mother that uh my father had come to her aid when she thought that life was over for her and she'll do anything she can to help us out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="482">QUESTION:  There was a big realization of informers. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">There were a lot of informing going on which would help?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">ANSWER:  Quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">The Germans rewarded the informants.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="486">QUESTION:  How did they do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="487">ANSWER:  There was an incentive. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">Well uh one of the things is uh whatever the possessions that remained from the Jews, they would share in those, uh the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">They...the property.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">QUESTION:  So if you turned in a Jewish family, you might stand to gain some of their wealth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="491">ANSWER:  Definitely. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Definitely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">QUESTION:  It was a direct benefit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  Direct benefit.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="495">QUESTION:  Were you surprised that some people took the incentive or or sided with the Germans, people you had known before the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="496">ANSWER:  You know, there is no surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">In the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , the age that I was at, I don't think I knew enough about human nature to really realize any of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">I think I was more aware of what was happening, what it took to survive, than what people would do. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">I think a lot of it...you know, it's the same as here. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">You see people who have very little and yet they go out and help the more needy and you see people who are very well off and they look the other way. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I think it's the same thing with then. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">It...1t was more as to how people perceived themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Uh sometimes the most religious were the ones that uh that probably would would turn on someone quicker and then there were some that uh truly believed in in saving a human life.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="504">QUESTION:  Because you're not necessarily talking about helping somebody in need. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">You're talking about really a tremendous personal sacrifice to to help someone.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="506">ANSWER:  Well, it's risking your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">Anybody...anybody saving a Jew, collaborating with a Jew uh stood to loose his life. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">If not his life at least his health because a good sized beating can leave one maimed, uh or worse.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">QUESTION:  What kind of brutality during those times did you witness, did you observe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="510">ANSWER:  Well, as I told you the the first sense of brutality was when the Russian prisoners of war came through, were driven through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the treatment of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">It was so cruel. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I mean people who were so hungry and thirsty and if someone uh went for for a bit of food or for a cup of water...I mean the Jewish people have always been taught to help, and uh you see people driven through...people ran to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to get especially water and something to drink with, and uh the Germans just turned on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">I don't recall them turning on the ones that were trying to give them the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">I remember them turning against the ones that went for the food, and I think this is probably why it left such a lasting impression on me is that if if a man is hungry and reaches for something, he gets beaten and and in some cases shot.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="515">QUESTION:  What other methods did the Germans have keeping...to keep the Jews in <span class="DLF">line</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="516">ANSWER:  Mostly by retaliation. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">Promising that nothing will happen to the Jews if they cooperate and uh if anybody uh...if they found that something was done against their orders, by retaliation. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I recall a few men who had escaped to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and uh actually the first partisans I guess I would call them. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">Uh when that became known, the first thing they did is gather a certain amount of people, took them out into the the main <span class="REGION">area</span> , the the open <span class="REGION">area</span> was the the <span class="DLF">synagogue courtyards</span> ...all the <span class="BUILDING">synagogues</span> were located around a large <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> , and shoot them or take them away to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Uh what they did is to make sure if... don't recall...I think they took them away to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">They may have shot several in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> itself but the majority of the time they would take more people and then have the...some return to tell the stories, to tell of the...of the manner in which the the others ones died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="522">QUESTION:  Rae, we're going to change tapes now and uh that's only going to take up a couple of minutes, and then we're going to...
ANSWER:  Gosh, has it been that long...
QUESTION:  It's been an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">Tape #2
QUESTION:  Rachel, I want to ask you...going back for a minute, uh under the ghettoization, there were Jewish leaders, there were liaisons to the Germans among the Jewish community and I understand that some of them argued against resistance, against fighting. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Do you recall that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="525">ANSWER:  Probably so, because every time that there was any kind of a stand, uh the Germans would uh inflict some deaths and injuries, so it was a matter of I think conscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I was much closer to that when we were in the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , because at that time my mother had made up her mind that she's going to try to uh get out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and join with the partisans and uh the leader of that particular <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> uh was a a very...I don't know how to put it...uh not really defiant but someone who who had the understanding of what was happening to others and a brother-in-law of his was a physician. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">My mother felt that if she, as a woman coming into a group...who wants a woman...who wants a woman with a child that's a responsibility, but if she brought someone with her who could contribute (cough)...excuse me...who could contribute, that uh she would be more welcome and this particular leader's sons also wanted to get away and uh I remember his answers. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">We used to meet in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he had a daughter my age and he wanted his children very much to survive and I understand one of his sons did survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">However uh would...and possibly the the daughter too, but uh they did want to be in touch with anyone because there were some Jewish people who had hard feelings against their father, but uh...
QUESTION:  Because he had been the liaison to the Germans?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">ANSWER:  Uh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Because in that position I guess there were sometimes when he knew about things and uh it was a matter of uh saving the majority. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">Uh...
QUESTION:  So was that the underlying...the underlying way of thinking...saving...what was good for the greatest number?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="533">ANSWER:  What was good for the greatest number. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Actually, he was taken away before the second <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was uh liquidated. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">He was taken out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with his whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">I don't know what the circumstances were but the two sons defied the Germans and managed to run away from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">I don't know whether the the father would have been taken to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">It ended up that the father was killed and uh the wife...the mother too, but the two sons and a daughter escaped, ran away from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">The older son was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">The younger one and the daughter were not, and they were hiding out in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> for a little bit and all the Jews there were so scared of their own well-being, of their own survival, they were ready to to uh give them back to the Germans, give them away, and the son did escape and uh really became a hero in the in the partisans, but we don't know for sure whether they survived or not, but that was a very good example where what do you do for the good of the community. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Uh...
QUESTION:  The the reason I asked that question is because when we look back at that time in history in retrospect, a question that always comes is why wasn't there more resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">Why didn't the Jews fight? </span><span class="sentence" id="543">What was it at that time that allowed this to happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="544">ANSWER:  Well, there were several things. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">One of them 1s the family unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Uh 1t wasn't every...everybody for himself...maybe more people could have survived if they would have left their families and gone on. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Uh if you try to escape with a family and with children, it becomes much more difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">The men did not want to leave their wives and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">Some of them did. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Some of them figured they'll get out and maybe they'll bring their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Some of them did bring their families. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">But it was a matter of how do you put yourself in the position of perhaps being the cause of somebody else's death. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">How do you live with yourself the rest of the time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="554">QUESTION:  You mentioned that the Jewish community had been very tight-knit, very well-organized and I guess the question also arises, why didn't the Jewish community organize against their oppressors?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="555">ANSWER:  Remember that they were surrounded by people who were not looking to help them but to hinder them. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">There was not really any <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">The partisans did not really get organized very well until probably the fall of '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Uh there were little groups here and there. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">They were hit and miss. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Uh the first partisans, and my mother was very much in touch with them...there were a few of the young men who escaped to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and the way they accumulated a few weapons was by uh staking out some <span class="DLF">roads</span> and finding a lonely...a lone I should say...German soldier who would pass by that they could uh kill and take his weapons, because that was the only way to take the the weapons from a soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Uh (laughter) I don't know whether...at that point I think it was a matter of kill or be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Uh they accumulated a few weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Some of the Russians...Russian prison of wars also had escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">Uh you know, when when people are treated like this, 1t doesn't matter...life or death...uh the <span class="DLF">line</span> between life and death becomes very, very narrow, and uh it's a matter...well, do I get killed and end my suffering or do I escape and have a chance to live and uh then then it's much easier to escape, but when you're the cause of the rest of your family's deaths, I mean it it's very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Also there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> really to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">You lived in a...amongst the population that was ready and willing to hand you over to the Germans again. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">It was only under the threat of fear that those people provided the food to the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">Once the partisans were able to get some weapons and once they had made contact with the uh Russians behind the <span class="DLF">lines</span> , then it became much easier because at that point the Russians had already sent...when the front was organized, uh the Russians had sent uh leadership, ammunitions and some supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Other than that, whatever supplies, whatever fighting supplies there were, were only very primitive or what was uh taken from the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="570">QUESTION:  Was there also in this...in this lack of resistance, a denial that we are, as you say, the upper crust, the the bourgeois?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="685">QUESTION:  What do you mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  Well, you know, it's it's who puts the highest fear into you, and at that point the partisans put the greatest fear into them, that if they ran to the Germans, that they could not return to their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and their families and then again how well would the Germans treat them. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">By then the Germans were feeling pretty much the uh the heat.</span></p>

QUESTION:  .. unified, the partisans...the Jews and...I mean I...
ANSWER:  Not unified them. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">Probably what unified them was the desire to get rid of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">Uh should I say that the Jews were very welcome...I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Uh there was quite a bit of anti-Semitism in the partisans too, but 1t was a matter of who did what. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">There weren't too many Jewish...too many women. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">My mother did the cooking and uh she was needed, so she did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Uh I sometimes peeled potatoes until I couldn't feel my fingers. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">Sometimes I would uh I was taught to to to do some things with the ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I could take apart a rifle and clean it probably faster than (laughter) than a soldier could. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">My little fingers managed to to get into <span class="NPIP">places</span> where big fingers couldn't get in and it was a matter of what was your worth. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">Everybody had to to have a certain worth.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="713">ANSWER:  Uh mother was a child during the Ist World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">She uh she helped with the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">She went into business rather early in life. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">Not only did she run a business but uh she also helped a sister get into business in a neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Uh Mother was a woman who ventured out into the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">She used to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> to buy uh yard goods...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ... <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vilna</span> was the main <span class="NPIP">place</span> , so she wasn't somebody that came from the <span class="REGION">hinterlands</span> and just stayed in the <span class="REGION">hinterlands</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">She had a very good head on her shoulders. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">I can only tell you that the war ended and my mother fell apart.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="721">QUESTION:  Now tell me about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">She had struggled so long for survival, as you said, the one day...from one day to the next just surviving, so what happens when when that is no longer there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="723">ANSWER:  (Sigh) A very sad story, very sad story. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">Uh my mother always had this feeling that because of who she was and what she was that she should have...she should have saved everybody, and to this day uh she she still keeps on talking about what she should have done and what she could have done, but of course if she could have done it she would have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Uh she lives with with this feeling of inadequacy of then, not of now. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">She never really adapted here. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">She was never any longer what she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">She had to struggle to to earn a livelihood. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">I mean since coming to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I'll tell you I've worked...I don't remember ever not working. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ...we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Mother thought that she was going to be able to get a job there and and manage better. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">The language was not as much of a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="734"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> really isn't a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> where somebody without without money and without a profession can can easily survive and she did not want to be dependent on my uncle and aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">Uh we didn't find it that easy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="736">Uh I hated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">As soon as I graduated from <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> ...in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> and my only ability to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> would be with my uncle's help. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I came here to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> and managed to get a very good job and go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at night and uh really liked this environment much better than the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">So Mother came back with me and and she really could never get a uh a decent job here, so it was sort of a matter of just surviving.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="740">QUESTION:  What in those immediate days following the war...now now first of all, let's go back, uh take a step back...you're with the partisan group. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Do you know who led that group that you were with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">ANSWER:  Uh at that point...I mean toward the end, by the time we came into the partisans, they had a pretty much uh uh a command. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">The commanders came from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="744">Uh we were with a special group so there was just one commander over this small group of people, but uh there was a chain of command that uh from from the brigade, and there were several brigades. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">The one that we were with was called Medvedev, but there were several <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">brigades</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="747">ANSWER:  Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">QUESTION:  Were you ever captured?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="749">ANSWER:  Oh we were captured during a <span class="DLF">blockade</span> , but when partisans went out on assignments uh to do their either demolition or uh sabotage, uh many of them were captured. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">I remember one woman was captured. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">She was Jewish too and uh she was returned in a potato sack in pieces and uh that that was the the lesson the Germans were trying to teach is that if you tried to do that to us and we'll show you what we can to do you. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">It never stopped anybody going out again.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="753">QUESTION:  What did...what effect did it have on all of you, on you in particular?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">ANSWER:  I think the effect it had is rather than intimidating, it became a challenge, that I'll go out and I'll do you even worse and I'll get away with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">QUESTION:  So it galvanized you?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="759">ANSWER:  Of course...some horrible death. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Uh towards...closer to liberation in early 1944, uh the Germans tried to rid the forests of the partisans because they were already in retreat and in order to to be able to fight the war, they had to get rid of this monkey on their back, somebody that that was inflicting all kinds of uh disruptions and they had...uh in addition to the Germans there were some Russian groups, actually it was a Ukrainian group in our part of the of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> ...where a whole military unit had turned themselves over to the Germans and they were fighting on the side of the Germans and uh they were doing the dirty work for the Germans, and those people had what they called the blockade. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">They surrounded every <span class="DLF">exit</span> from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">They kept on pushing the partisans into the into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> deeper and uh managed to to capture quite a number of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Uh we were captured together with at that point some partisans and some of the villagers because the villagers ran too. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">They were afraid to stay and also some of the partisans made them go with them because this was a protection, having, you know, blending into into the population and we were brought back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">home town</span> and at that point uh I had uh typhoid fever and I was shaven. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">My head was shaven, so dressed in boy's clothing, I looked very much like a boy and they were separating men and women. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">The Germans had this uh I don't know...phobia I guess, not to keep men and women together, even boys and and and their mothers, and they were going to separate me from my mother and that was my my biggest fear and they were arguing...junge madchen, madchen junge...,boy, girl, boy, girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">Guess what I did? (</span><span class="sentence" id="768">Laughter) I said I was a madchen, a girl, and uh since my mother identified herself as my mother, uh they presumed that she was gentile and she was harboring a Jewish child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="769">QUESTION:  How did they know you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="770">ANSWER:  Because I said the word madchen. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">Where do I know it from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="772">QUESTION:  That's a Yiddish word?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="773">ANSWER:  Well, it's the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">It's very similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">You must realize that most of the gentiles in that part of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> are pretty illiterate and uh did not catch on to German.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">QUESTION:  Oh I see. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">You understood the German...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="778">ANSWER:  I understood the German conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">If I understood the German and when the cards are down, you kind of come up with an inner strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="780">QUESTION:  What effect do you think it had on your mother and yourself to know that the key to your survival meant denying being a Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="781">To vehemently...vehemently deny being a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">In fact, at that moment your survival depended on convincing someone else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="783">ANSWER:  Oh that <span class="NPIP">part</span> was easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">That <span class="NPIP">part</span> was easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Surviving is what mattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">But I'll tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">As much as surviving mattered, we had very little to eat and the only thing available was pork and I would not eat pork and neither would my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">My mother cooked it for the partisans but we never ate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">We'd sooner eat just a potato.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="790">QUESTION:  So in your own ways, you kept your Jewish observances, what you could?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="791">ANSWER:  Uh adhered to the Jewish principles. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I wouldn't say we kept the Jewish observances. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">We adhered to Jewish principles wherever possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Uh if it was a matter of life and death, it's a different story. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Probably if somebody would have told me to eat pork to prove that I wasn't Jewish, I would eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">Maybe I would be sick to my stomach later but I would eat it but when there was a choice, no question.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="797">QUESTION:  Uh let me ask you about what happened when the war ended...and how did you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="798">How did the news reach you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="799">ANSWER:  Well, what happened was 1s that we...eventually we joined the partisans again. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">We had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">We couldn't...now long can you hide amongst a population of non-Jews, especially for my mother where she was known throughout the <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Eventually somebody recognized her and she overheard some women talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">She thinks that nobody knows it. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">There were no Germans around. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">That was the...that was our luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">She says nobody knows that...no...she thinks that that you can fool everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Mother tried to stay out of the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I was...at that point I was the one that had to organize some food and I was the one that that went out and brought news. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">Supposedly she was sick and couldn't move, but nonetheless, you know, you you stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Uh somebody sees you and uh Mother overheard that uh that somebody recognized her and at that point there were some people, of course, that were sympathetic too and uh told us where there were some partisans beginning to organize again, and that's what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">We went and I joined up with them and uh actually had a very long march to to try to to get out of the way of the armies. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">Tried to to join a unit and uh at that point, I mean there was communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">There were radios, because they...the group communicated with the...actually with the Russians behind the <span class="DLF">lines</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="814">QUESTION:  So before that time you survived for that short period of time actually living with Germans...German soldiers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="815">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">Living with the peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">But with the Germans being very close by.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="818">QUESTION:  And you mother was a cook?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="819">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">In the partisans, the Germans...but when I'm...after the blockade when we were caught by the Germans...that's when we lived amongst the villagers, before we rejoined the partisans again. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">But in the...with the partisan group, Mother was a cook.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="822">QUESTION:  Now you're with the partisan group and the Germans are now retreating and somehow's there a sense that the end of the war is coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Is that correct?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="824">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">See by...by the uh latter part of the occupation, uh when the Russians were already advancing, we had communication. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">The partisans had communication with the with the Russian armies.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="827">QUESTION:  So you knew the war...the end of the war was coming?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="828">ANSWER:  We knew that the Russians were coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">We knew where...which direction they were coming from, and we were actually heading in that direction to join up with them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">QUESTION:  OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">So there was one day where the war ended for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">Do you remember that day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="833">ANSWER:  Vaguely. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">Very vaguely. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">All I remember is sleeping...sleeping in a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and not worrying about anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">It was still very unsettled. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">To give you an example, no sooner did the war end when we had to again be very wary because some of the population, when they realized there were some Jews that remained alive, uh tried to eliminate us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="838">QUESTION:  Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="839">Why did they care at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="840">ANSWER:  Anti-Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">Hate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">QUESTION:  Hate that that...
ANSWER:  That Jews...(sigh) I don't know if any of you can possibly understand what it is like to live in a community where there is so much belligerence, where you're so despised, where you're not wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">I mean we read in the papers about the the the uprising in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and so forth, but you also realize that the same people had called on all the Jews to leave the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and that is already during the the affiliation with <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , after the war, many years after the war, twenty years after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">QUESTION:  So the anti-Semitism was fueled by the hardship imposed on the Polish people by the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="845">It was always there, but you didn't feel it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="846">ANSWER:  It...1t...1t was always there. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">It's just that probably as a child in a protective environment, I didn't feel it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="848">QUESTION:  So there was still a threat.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="849">ANSWER:  Of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="850">QUESTION:  I mean what what what constituted safety? </span><span class="sentence" id="851">What what...after the war was over and and you faced yet another threat...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">ANSWER:  After the war was over, it was a matter now of how to get out of where you were. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">Uh my mother particularly wanted to get out from the <span class="REGION">Russian area</span> and uh she was able to uh dig up some valuables that were hidden and uh managed to bribe uh...was_ a work...<span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">working train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="854">You know, the the <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> were pretty much uh destroyed, and uh the only movement of troops was by by railroad and uh restructuring the the <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> and the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> was of primary uh need in order to move towards the <span class="DLF">front lines</span> , so Mother signed on...signed on...bribed somebody to accept us as part of the workforce and we were heading toward <span class="REGION">Central Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Her main objective was to get as close to the <span class="DLF">line</span> ...we knew that the Americans were pushing from the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , so we knew that the Russians and the Americans were eventually to meet, so the idea was to get as close to that <span class="REGION">area</span> as possible and to go over to the <span class="REGION">American side</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="856">QUESTION:  Where did that happen?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">ANSWER:  For us, it didn't happen that easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">It happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , but uh...there was...it was a long way from <span class="REGION">eastern Poland</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Uh our first direction was toward the Baltic Sea actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Uh Mother thought by going straight toward <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ...and that's where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was going, however, when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Prussia</span> , conditions were terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">The Prussians had mined anything and everything that they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">They mined the chandeliers. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">They mined the the equipment in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="864">They mined themselves so when the Russians went to remove the bodies, they they killed themselves and mined themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">They were blown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">Uh it became very dangerous and also my mother ran into a general, a Jewish general, and uh after a conversation, a short conversation, he kind of alluded to it that he was Jewish and he said if you think that the Germans were bad, wait and see what awaits us. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">He advised her to to head south. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">He heard there were some Jews in <span class="REGION">southern Poland</span> , and the next thing was he actually arranged for...brief...we lived in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span> with another Jewish family...for that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">box car</span> to be hooked on to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> heading that direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="869">QUESTION:  What was he alluding to...awaits you where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="870">ANSWER:  The anti-Semitism and the hardships, if we remained in in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="871">QUESTION:  In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="872">And he was...he was a general with the Polish army?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="873">ANSWER:  With the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">No more Polish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">No more Polish army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">QUESTION:  So your mother headed south to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="877">That's...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="878">ANSWER:  Now we headed south. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">We found ourselves in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , which is <span class="REGION">southern Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Uh over...when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , actually the war was still going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Uh we were in <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> by the time we heard that the war was coming to an end and we actually crossed into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> just about...when we came to <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> we found out that uh the war is ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="882">QUESTION:  What was the like for you to receive that news that the war had ended?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">ANSWER:  I remember more coming into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , coming through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="884">Uh the the trip was rather trying. </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Uh we stayed in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> for a while where Poles in general were not very much liked and Jews definitely not but at that point uh the Israelis have already sent uh people to to organize the Jews, to uh to take charge sort of, to make the the trek toward <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and our intentions were not to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Our intentions were to reach <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="887">That was the only haven. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Uh when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> , uh there were already a few Israeli uh people, not necessarily Israeli-born, probably Polish born, but who came to organize the Jews and prepare them for the trek to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and uh from there we went to <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> and then to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and it was all on on the way to uh to get across into the occupied zones other than the Russian occupied zones. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And there are certain incidents that stand out in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">One of the incidents that stands out in mind 1s uh coming to...sort of getting across the <span class="DLF">border</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and hitting upon British troops who sent us back to the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> because we were in the wrong <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="891">And uh at that time we already had the guides uh that were sent by <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and we had to cross the Alp...the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="892">We went through some of the passes in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> and the thing that stands out most in my mind is crossing into <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="893">We were cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">We were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">We were frozen, not just cold, and I saw an Israeli flag, the blue and white flag with the Jewish star and I was sure I was hallucinating and uh, you know, all of us sort of...do you see it? </span><span class="sentence" id="896">What do you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="897">See blue and white flag with with the Jewish star on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">Well, it was the Israeli brigade and I didn't tell you how well we were received, but not only that. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">Of all the people there, everybody...where are you from? </span><span class="sentence" id="900">I come from a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> nobody heard of. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And of all the people to meet, my governess' brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">I couldn't get over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">I ran for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Mother met him. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">Mother remembered him when he left for <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and uh he gave me and I still have it, the soldiers had a little tiny bible. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">It's about that big. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">Probably three by four inches...that he carried and uh he gave it to me, so that I would not forget my studies, and the fact that I had not spoken Hebrew since 19 probably 41, to be able to to communicate, to be able to speak, to be able to get my...my feelings across and to understand what was being said, probably the the most joyous time that I know of. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">I think 1t was more joyous than coming to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="909">QUESTION:  So was your intention at that time to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="910">ANSWER:  Oh yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="911">QUESTION:  So how...what happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="912">ANSWER:  What happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">We stayed with the brigade for about three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">We were put in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was waiting some <span class="NPIP">place</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> , and our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> broke down. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">There were quite a number of Jews that were collected near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bologna</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Italy</span> and uh needless to say when a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> breaks down, you don't go any further. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">We missed that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="918">We missed three <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="919">We even missed the Exodus. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And by then uh things became pretty clear that uh it was difficult to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="921">Somehow my mother got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Mother was very sickly after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Uh I would say more dead than alive and uh she...she developed asthma which was probably psychosomatic. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">At least it was diagnosed psychosomatic asthma here in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but 1t seemed like the slightest...slightest excitement would bring on an attack, and unless I got her a shot of adrenalin, God knows what would happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And uh we were supposed to leave to to meet the Exodus when she had a very bad attack of asthma and she was taken to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I thought the the world came at an end because we were not going to get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">We were not going to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and uh at that point, we managed...somehow Mother had heard about that you could put in an ad into the forwards and she remembered writing the address to my uncle and aunt. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Actually my aunt was my father's sister...that it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington, DC</span> , so somebody saw our name in the paper, happened to alert my uncle to it and uh he wrote to the forwards who could forward the letter to us and we made contact and uh he was willing to...he wrote us not to try to go anywhere and he would try to to get us over. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">He made out papers but the Polish quota was full, so we couldn't come. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">They were letting just a trickle in and I'm sure if we would have waited for the Polish quota, I don't know when we would have gotten to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but because my mother knew, you know that we were so close to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> and convinced the Council that uh she actually was born on the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> , that uh we were able to come on the Russian quota which was open because very few people immigrated from <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> over quite a number of years, and uh so we came in November 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">November 17, 1947 we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="931">QUESTION:  Throughout the war and the hiding and the freezing and the starving, your mother remained strong and was able to go forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">After the war, she became sick.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="933">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="934">QUESTION:  Why is that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="935">ANSWER:  I guess coming to the realization that in the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> the struggle to survive kind of ended and missing everybody and as I've mentioned to you, she kind of felt that uh she was a big business woman and she she could do most anything and the thing that would have mattered to her the most, she wasn't able to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="936">QUESTION:  Which was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="937">ANSWER:  Saving her family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="938">QUESTION:  Do you think it was only then that she allowed herself to experience her loss?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="939">ANSWER:  Probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">You know, we're all strong during bad times, but we fall apart during good ones, and I think that's the time when when it finally hit her. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">I've survived, but...
QUESTION:  What did it mean to you to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="942">ANSWER:  I don't know whether it really meant anything to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="943">It's what what I've experienced in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that became to mean quite a bit to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="944">QUESTION:  And what's that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="945">ANSWER:  Oh...going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , freedom, uh being able to walk the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , being able to hold my head up high, being an equal even though I wasn't an equal. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">I was still living a _nightmare, but nonetheless I had all the opportunity and could take advantage of those opportunities. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">I was an equal in respect with being able to do what I...the goals that I had set for myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="948">QUESTION:  Did you return to religious observances that you weren't able to __ during the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="949">ANSWER:  Oh I'm probably less observant now than I was then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="950">QUESTION:  Why is that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="951">ANSWER:  Uh I think integrating meant an awful lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Going out on a date and having to go to a <span class="BUILDING">kosher restaurant</span> and uh not be able to go out on a Saturday night up until a certain time, not being able to get a job that I needed so badly other than working on Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">My first experience was I went with a friend of mine from <span class="BUILDING">school</span> to to look for for a job, a summer job, and every job I went for I had to work on Saturday. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">I had to ride on Saturday to get to my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">I think it's little by little uh those feelings uh break down. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">You know, you take...you do one thing and then you're allowed to do the next one. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">It's...unless you keep a very strict observance, there's no such thing as just slightly strict.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="958">QUESTION:  Uh the adjustment...there were good...there were many good things about being in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but the adjustment was not easy?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="959">ANSWER:  It really wasn't too difficult for me because when I came to my uncle's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , I became the fourth daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Probably being a little bit resented by the others but uh my uncle was aa very...very smart and good natured man. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">The first example...was very important for young ladies on their sixteenth birthday to get their first fur coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">Well low and behold, his daughter was made to wait to get her first fur coat until I came here and we got identical ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">Needless to say, I can understand now why my cousin resented me a little bit.

QUESTION:  Uh what is your life like today?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="972">ANSWER:  Well, when I survived the war, probably not until I finished <span class="BUILDING">school</span> I should say...even in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> because uh when I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> uh Hebrew was offered and uh I needed a language requirement and that was an easy language requirement. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I could get a lot of...a lot of credits by just taking one semester and taking the regent's examination, but I became very much aware of the fact of of passing on Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Uh amazingly enough, there was a a German woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">She was my counselor, and she was very apprehensive at first when she found out...when I was assigned to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">Ms. Reef (ph) felt like she had to set things straight and probably helped me a great deal in judging people uh on their merits. </span><span class="sentence" id="977">She helped me a great deal get through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and adjust to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and uh accept I guess some of the prejudices, I guess, in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and deal with them and make me aware that I have some...something to pass on too. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">Uh she got me to substitute in <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew class</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="979">If the teacher couldn't make it, there were very few Hebrew uh substitutes, and I guess I was a better substitute than anybody they could get to babysit and that's sort of like passing on. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I remember saying...her saying to me, well you know it and you can impart more than somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">It became a matter of imparting. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Uh...
