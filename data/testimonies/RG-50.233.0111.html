<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  How big is that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">university city</span> , very famous for the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , students. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">It was a very old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , a very prosperous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and we lived in a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">My father had a <span class="BUILDING">linen factory</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  A <span class="BUILDING">linen factory</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Is that like a <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  A <span class="BUILDING">textile factory</span> , which was confiscated by the Nazis already in 1933 because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> was one of the high spots of Nazism, like all the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Heidelberg</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Partabon</span> , all of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">cities</span> with big <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> became the symbol of Nazism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  Is this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> , 1s that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="10">ANSWER:  No <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> is between <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> and in the middle of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">I can show it to you on the map.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Can you tell me, you said you had a brother and a sister, so there were three children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  We were three children at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I had a brother who was born 1915 and a sister who was born 1917.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  Do you remember their birthdays?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="16">ANSWER:  Yes, my brother was born, I will have to look it up, one second. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">My brother was born June 4, 1915 and my sister was born June 16, 1917.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Did your mother help out with the business also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  No, no, my mother was strictly a housewife.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION:  Did <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> have a very sizeable <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER:  It was a very lot of Rosenbergs and Grosenbergs intermarriages. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I would think there were about, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was about 40,000 people when I was a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I imagine there were about 2,000 Jewish people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">All were well off.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Some of the German Jews I talked to said they weren’t very religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="26">ANSWER:  We were not religious at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Not religious.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">QUESTION:  Were there many religious people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="29">ANSWER:  Yes, there were also. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">We had a very beautiful <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> and my father also went to the High Holy days, but I personally was not and I am still non- religious I must say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  Did you attend <span class="BUILDING">private school</span> or <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="32">ANSWER:  No I attended <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> and we had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">We were thrown out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> in 1934. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">The <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> was confiscated and the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> came with SR men and told my father if you are not out by next week, we throw you in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furnace</span> or out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Which they actually did to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">QUESTION:  This is of your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> or of your business?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="37">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">The business was confiscated in 1933 by the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">This was the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> we lived in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="40">QUESTION:  When they confiscated the business, was there a reason given?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  The reason was given that in 1928 and ’29, there was a world depression and like many businesses the business went bad and so the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> said we need the business and the Jews cannot do it anymore so we just take it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And they renamed it from S & R Rosenberg to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen Linen</span> which means the City of Gottingen Linen Factory.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  After that your father was no longer involved in the business at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Well my father was permitted, because he always traveled as a salesman to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and the first three years he could still do a little bit of work, but the companies in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> did not accept a Jewish salesman anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So it died out by itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="46">QUESTION:  Can you describe a little bit when they came and made you leave your <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  I was too small. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">I only know what my father told me that one morning the owner of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> came with three SR men which is like SS people, and put a gun on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and told him, if you Jew are not out within one week we throw you and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> out of the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="49">That’s all I remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">QUESTION:  So a week later they came back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  No, no, then my father told them, look it cannot be done in a week, I have to find a new <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> first, but within four weeks we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> because my mother was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and my father who was a very old German couldn’t believe what was happening said this will pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> was a much better <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , 1t was not such anti-Semitism as it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So we bought a beautiful <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and we moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , and we were hoping, my father was hoping, that this would pass and he would get everything back in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">My father was in the First World War like all other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="55">QUESTION:  He was a veteran’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">ANSWER:  My whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">Many were killed in the First World War.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  Did he get another job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  He couldn’t get a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , but my brother worked and my sister started working and we got some money from a very rich uncle in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hanover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So we could survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I also started working. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I was thrown out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I was an apprentice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  When were you thrown out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  I was thrown out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> when I was 14 years old in 1935.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  And that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">No more Jews could go to <span class="BUILDING">German schools</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  Were there <span class="BUILDING">private Jewish schools</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="70">ANSWER:  Yes, but we didn’t have the money so that I could go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">I became an apprentice in a Jewish export and import company. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">You couldn’t get a job in a gentile business so you had to be in a Jewish business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  What did you do there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  Export and import.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Did you do like clerical work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  Clerical work, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Q? </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Where did your brother and sister work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  My brother and sister worked at two big <span class="BUILDING">Jewish department stores</span> as salespeople. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">One was called Gabruder Robeson and Gabruder Heft, but that’s not important, and my brother, by the way, was taken in 1938 from that particular <span class="BUILDING">store</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> in °38.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">QUESTION:  Did they both finish <span class="BUILDING">school</span> before they took these jobs?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  They were also thrown out of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Not thrown out. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">We moved from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> and my father had no more money, it’s very simple. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">We had to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">They were older than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">My brother, in 1933 was already much older, 18 or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">He became an apprentice. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> you have to be an apprentice for three years before you can call yourself a full- fledged salesperson. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">Here you start without anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">QUESTION:  Can you tell me a little bit about when they came and took your brother away?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">ANSWER:  They didn’t come to us, he was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">That was the Kristallnacht when all the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> were demolished. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">We don’t know how he was taken, we only got a telephone call from somebody who had left in time and told us that all Jewish employees men had been taken to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">That’s all we know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="97">QUESTION:  That’s all they said?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Then we heard from all over the same stories and we didn’t know where he was until one day we got a postcard from him. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They were permitted to write one postcard, that I am well off in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> for a short time. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">It wasn’t a short time he was there until February or March 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">He was very badly beaten and sick when he came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">He had something with the leg, I don’t remember what it was, they had beaten his leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I don’t remember these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">He couldn’t work any more and then he went, the British opened the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kitchener camp</span> for young Jews who had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">He got a red stamp on his passport that said if you don’t leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> within three months you go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  Did he ever describe to you what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Well he told us exactly how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Yes, exactly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">QUESTION:  What did he say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">ANSWER:  It was a tremendous camp and the Jews were beaten and mishandled and treated the worst.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Were there other people there besides Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">ANSWER:  Jews were the minority.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  Who else was there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="115">ANSWER:  Anti-German, anti-Nazi, homosexuals, people who didn’t want to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">All different types of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Were there Communist people there also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Plenty of Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But you see, these people who have been there already three or four years and survived, they were already the kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">You know what kapos are? </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They were the leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">You see the SS only was the guard, while the prisoners themselves were the people who did all the work <span class="NPIP">inside</span> the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And these few Communists who were there since 33 and had survived, they were now the commandos and the SS of course did the beating and the killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But many of these kapos were more brutal than the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">You see the SS used the difference of the nationalities or religions against each other in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">prison camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">You see?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  So basically, the Jews were treated the worst of the people there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">ANSWER:  Oh, yes, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  So political prisoners would be of a higher level.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  If they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Many did not survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  Were they taken to work out of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  At that time there was no work so they had to shovel sand from one <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and build a new <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> to be busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">The work was at that time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> yes, they made <span class="DLF">streets</span> inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they worked from six in the morning until six in the night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  But they just made them work to keep them busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  To exhaust them. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">While in other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Neuengamme</span> they built tremendous big channels and things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">It was a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="139">But the real work that the prisoners were put to work started after 1939, after the war started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Did your parents try to get in contact with him after he sent the postcard or tried to go there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  My father went to the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and tried, we tried to send packages we do not know if he got it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I was a small kid and basically couldn’t do anything at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">We do not know if the packages arrived or not and my mother wrote a letter, after the first postcard, it said Rosenberg, number so and so, and we do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">He later told us that he got three letters. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">My mother wrote every week.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  But not the packages, you do not know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="147">ANSWER:  He got one or two packages for Christmas, or something.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  What did they tell your father at the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  Nothing, we don’t know anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  They didn’t say anything.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  No, nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  Can you describe to me Kristallnacht? </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Do you remember anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="154">ANSWER:  Yes, exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">I was already working at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I started working as an apprentice at the export/import company of Artur Cohen in 1936 and this company was taken over after the Kristallnacht by an SS officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">When Kristallnacht happened, I think there were only Jewish owners there who were taken to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> from their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , Dr. Cohen and Mr. There were two two assistant Jews, the others were already all gentiles and I was an apprentice and for whatever reason, they were not interested in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I didn’t go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I tried to stay away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because I heard the rumors and I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> late at night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  This was in November?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  November 8, 1938.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:  So you stayed late at your <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And SS officers came to your <span class="BUILDING">place of work</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  They came and took away the two assistants. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Dr. Cohen has been taken away already from his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he was a very famous man because his father was a senator before him. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Both of the brothers were taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">They moved later on to <span class="COUNTRY">South Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I still have a letter from them after the separation. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">When I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> I heard from my mother that my brother was taken to <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> and when my father went to the police, this is an interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">You know, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> every year you have different police departments in different parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and when my father came there and he asked by sheer coincidence the officer in charge was a former comrade in arms from World War I, and he said, Fritz Rosenberg, come in here for a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And he told him what are you doing here, are you crazy to come here? </span><span class="sentence" id="171">I have orders on my list to bring you in. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But he said look we fought together in World War 1, so I said, look, I tell you what I do, you go out this <span class="DLF">door</span> and don’t go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> before tomorrow morning so if somebody comes there you are not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">And that’s what my father did. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">He went to my aunt who was a lady and there was nobody living there, lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> and he stayed there all night. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You see. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And that German police officer because he was by sheer coincidence a former comrade in arms from World War | saved my father from <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Most probably he wouldn’t have survived anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">My brother was young, that’s a different story. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">But many people didn’t come back from Kristallnacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They were beaten already when they got into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and the German SS would you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  Did the police come to your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that evening?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  No, my mother said nobody came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">QUESTION:  So when did you get <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="184">The next morning?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">ANSWER:  I also went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">At that time we could still go out anytime we want. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I had a girlfriend, a young girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I went to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and I called my parents and I said, look I’m staying with, I forgot her name. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I am sorry to tell you, Eva. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I’m staying with Eva. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">She was transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Riga</span> and murdered there. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Everybody died somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="193">QUESTION:  Now, let see, do you remember what damage was done?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="387">ANSWER:  Not there, in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">There were about 30 people and therefore my girlfriend, Erica could come because she was on the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">But because 30 people didn’t show up, she was permitted to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">It had to be thousand people, Germans are exact, they have to be exact. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">We left the next morning, at the Jewish Community in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> delivered soup and the Jewish leader in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> told us, don’t worry you go to work and we loaded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sewing machines</span> and equipment for you, and with food and you will be well taken care of, I have the guarantee from the SS and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Where will you go, we go to the East. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Well it took four days and when we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> in the evening we were surrounded by very heavy SS guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">We were not permitted to get out, it was November, but we saw across the our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> with Russian prisoners, in open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle cars</span> , and we saw how one or two German soldiers would throw in one bread in each <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and these people were starved to death , would start fighting and the minute they would start fighting, then SS said mutiny and would take their machine guns and Brrrrrrr. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">It was the first impression for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And then the next morning, now I was made a so- called runner from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with a yellow ribbon because there had to be some kind of communication when we stopped.- We stopped three or four times on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Some people got sick, we had no doctor, but we had a nurse with us, a Jewish nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">It had to be somebody who could run fast and I was very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">So I had a much better idea what was going on in the different <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">I was only with two more people, we could go from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , the SS would open the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and we would try to bring these people to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> where the nurse was. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">There was no medical things there. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">But when we got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , I was also there and Dr. Frank, who was the leader of the transport, a former German officer, a lawyer, the ex-commander of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> was standing there and said, where is your leader from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="403">So Dr. Frank, who had one of these Spanish little things on his head, you know, said Sir, and he saluted him I have one thousand Jews men and women and children from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> and that was the first impression, then that SS man took his whip and “slap” to his face and he fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">You dirty Jew when you speak to an SS man, take your hat off. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">You see, that was the first impression of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And then, you want to continue, or is that too far?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="407">QUESTION:  No, no go ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="408">ANSWER:  And then we had to go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="409">QUESTION:  So there is already a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> established there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="410">ANSWER:  From the Russian Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="411">QUESTION:  You said something about when you got there that they had to kill many Russian Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="412">ANSWER:  We didn’t know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">When we got there the SS people taught us we walked, cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  This was November?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="415">ANSWER:  Cold and many old people couldn’t make it up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I remember this. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">And we got there and we saw this red <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , this used to be a former <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and the white <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , also a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , is for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">The red is not for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So we got into these <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , Dr. Frank and the first young man, because the others took much longer time to get there, the food was still on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , whatever little food they had, these people were already pushed into the <span class="BUILDING">school buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">The dead bodies were still there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="421">QUESTION:  Inside the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="422">ANSWER:  Inside the two <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So Dr. Frank said we have to clean up before we let the people in. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So we tried very hard to clean up. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">There were not that many bodies, maybe thirty, forty. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">They had taken everybody away, these most probably were in hiding and when the SS went through the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">And then we learned, it was a few days later, there was a big <span class="DLF">fence</span> between the Russian and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German Jewish ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">The SS put a big <span class="DLF">fence</span> there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="429">QUESTION:  So you were kept apart from the Russians?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="430">ANSWER:  They had built it to keep us separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And when we came to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , first we were not permitted to go to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , but later on you couldn’t always, you know the guards couldn’t be all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">They told us that thirty thousand Jews had been killed in the last three days to make room for the German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">For the Yekkas (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="434">they called us the “Yekkas”. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">The Yekkas is a typical German Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">So I didn’t speak Yiddish at that time, I spoke German and these people spoke Yiddish, so you had, Yiddish is a turned around German. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So we couldn’t touch them but we could talk to them at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And we learned about the tragedies that every day there actions, every day there killings and there were about one hundred thousand Russian Jews, but every day they would kill some of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">We didn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">My father said, come on. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">My father was typical law abiding citizen and they made Dr. Frank the leader of the German part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">About three days later the next <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> already and we didn’t know where to put these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">And two days later a transport from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Frankfurt</span> , all with thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And then the SS commander came and said well you can move into the small <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">These were not real <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , these were little from can you imagine in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> you have, where you go for the summer, a little <span class="BUILDING">summerhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It was not very big, with wood, and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">stove</span> inside and tiny <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , you know, like this, but we did not have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> and so on and it was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But my family and my mother, father, and my sister, we moved together with other family, Blywise and Himmelstein to one of these little <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">Then after awhile, after about four weeks about seven or eight <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> arrived all together and then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">The last one came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yanof</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Then it stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And then we started to work, we were picked up in the morning by heavy guard, twenty men, or twenty women. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">German soldiers homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">I had a very good job, I mean, I had plenty to eat, much more than the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">I was permitted every Sunday to visit my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">SS guard would bring me and pick me up the next morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">But most commandos only worked during the day and went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">But certain commandos stayed on the job because it was impossible to transport them back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">I was very lucky, very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">First I worked in the <span class="BUILDING">German hospital</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was later made into a <span class="BUILDING">German home</span> for soldiers so I compared to others and I was able to bring little things to my parent. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Sometimes extra soup, if I wasn’t searched. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">If you were searched and they found something, they would (sound effect). </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I came with an SS guard already and the guard would look the other way they didn’t expect me to bring anything in. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">That was about all together about eight months. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">The officer in charge his name was Breimeier who for whatever cockeyed reason was very good to me, he killed other Jews, but I was his pet for whatever reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">These people were abnormal, abnormal people. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And there’s another interesting story, 1f you want to hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">One day he told me, he said, Heinz, tomorrow morning we expect some German artists to entertain the troops and I want you to help them with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">So when I went up there this one German man said to me how come you speak such a perfect German, are you a Russian Jew? </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I said no, I am a German Jew, I’m from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">He said, from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> , and this was a girlfriend of my sister’s, they went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> together. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">So I said, Sir, ’'m sorry I cannot talk to you because I am a prisoner here. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Come on, how can you be a prisoner, then he saw the Jewish Star and the big cross (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="473">here. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Side 2, Tape 1 He didn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And she was the first one who taught me. (</span><span class="sentence" id="476">blank space on tape at this point) She said, I have heard and been told by SS people that this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> will be eliminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">She knew already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="478">QUESTION:  And this was still in °41?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="595">ANSWER:  Yes, she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">So this was May. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">So we had this action in July, I think, 26" or 29" where they killed thirty-five thousand Jews in one clip.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="598">QUESTION:  Now can you tell me, you were talking about this man who was, you worked for and got beer for and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">Were German Jews treated differently than Russian Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="600">ANSWER:  No, you see, what it was, and this I read also in the book here from this Kohl, that F commander of White Russia General Kula or whatever, I give you the name, he has the biggest fight with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> because he said I don’t want anything to happen to the German Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">I don’t mind if you kill all the Russian Jews, but the German Jews are good people, they work, they’re qualified, I want to keep them. </span><span class="sentence" id="602">And he was overruled by the German high command. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Either you do it or you’re out. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So he had no choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">But he was in the beginning fighting for, as a matter of fact, there is one German Jew who was in the war with the Kaiser’s son and he was sent back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and I have his book here, “One German Jew”. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">And this SS man went to him in person and said, look, you’re the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I will make a personal request from Hitler that you will and he was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="608">So you see that SS he was later blown up by the Party friends of <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Because he hated the Russian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">He hated the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">But for some other reason he thought he wanted to save the German Jews, he wanted to send them back after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Q” Did you see some of this like this treatment in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> ’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="613">ANSWER:  Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">You have to understand something. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">When we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , you have to understand the German Jews basically were much softer than the Russian Jews or Polish Jews because they lived a much harder life already,.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">QUESTION:  Soft, you mean physically?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">ANSWER:  Physically, more, better <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , better life, all lawyers, all doctors, all businessmen. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Jews who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> were locksmiths or carpenters, they had more trades. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">And they could live more easily from what they had. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Unfortunately, the German Jews in a certain way, especially the Western Jews, were already much more used to the easier life. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">That’s why they died easier too, and faster. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">They couldn’t take the cold, they couldn’t take the snow, they couldn’t take the hardships of life. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">The Russian Jews wouldn’t have died if Hitler wouldn’t have killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">And the German Jews wouldn’t have died either, not all of them, if Hitler hadn’t killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">But the German Jews and the French Jews and the Viennese, especially, or the Czechs, they were much softer, it’s the same here. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">A man from <span class="DLF">Park Avenue</span> will not survive than a man from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harlem</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="627">It’s nothing against the Jews from other <span class="NPIP">parts</span> , you understand, I love anybody, I only bring it out that we were not used to thirty below zero. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">They lived there, it was nothing for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">They were servants in the morning and my father was dying little by little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="630">QUESTION:  After July 1942?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="639">QUESTION:  Of your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">ANSWER:  Of our so-called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German ghetto</span> of seven thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">And after this action everybody had to move to the part where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> and Frankfurt Jews used to be, the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dusseldorf</span> , I don’t remember which ones. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">And the others were closed already. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">And there only were some survivors, and some of them went crazy, some of them just couldn’t understand, there was nobody left when they came from work. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">The whole families completely wiped out, you go out, you say goodbye, you come back and there is nothing left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">QUESTION:  Your family was still there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">ANSWER:  My family, we lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> part. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">We were lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">My family was still alive when I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">I was very lucky, I tell you honestly. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">But I was also very young, very strong, I could lift a horse by myself, you see.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">QUESTION:  So what happened after this? </span><span class="sentence" id="652">This first large scale?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="653">ANSWER:  They were every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">Mr. Gruber, the SS commander of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , Mr. Gruber, he was not all over in charge, but he was the one in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">Every day he would take five or ten people or one with more children and send them to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">He would kill them himself on the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="657">We didn’t know, because if you were there I wouldn’t be here.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="658">QUESTION:  But did you know people were leaving, nobody knew people were dying except for family members every day lie that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">ANSWER:  You saw it, you saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">You just couldn’t do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">He would go through with the Latvian SS men and just say you come with me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="662">QUESTION:  Whoever they found on the <span class="DLF">street</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="663">ANSWER:  Whatever reason, if they would find them on the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , or they would find them, --- One day there was a beautiful girl who worked together with my brother, Marion Barrow and she had painted, she was a painter, a sign painter, new sign, Largo a beautiful sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Who made this beautiful sign? </span><span class="sentence" id="665">So, at that time we had already the third Jewish man in charge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , two were killed already and he said oh that was Marion Barrow (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="666">He said why don’t you call her. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">This is very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">And he called her, and took her to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and killed her. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">And now when I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> I met the daughter of her sister who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and the sister had died a week before we came and she wanted to know the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And it’s very hard for me to tell a family member what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">There were two more actions. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">I don’t know, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Russian ghetto</span> actions were every day, and our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there were two more actions, I think, I cannot tell you the amount of people that were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">But I only know one thing, that on September 1, 1943, there were only two thousand five hundred German Jews left and about the same amount of Russian Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">That was from a camp of one hundred and thirty five thousand men, women and children. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Within two years they had killed about one hundred and thirty thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">We’ ll have to make it short, otherwise we’ll never come to an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="677">QUESTION:  You said there were two other actions? </span><span class="sentence" id="678">They would be between July ’42 and September ’43?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  Yes, every day were actions. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">Gas ones came in all the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">QUESTION:  You never did any of these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gas vans</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Were they all staffed by the SS?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="683">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">You see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> would come in and the people were forced to jump into them.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="685">QUESTION:  Did these people know what these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">vans</span> would do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">ANSWER:  Of course they knew, by now it wasn’t the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">The people who arrived in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , they saw these big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">moving vans</span> with the <span class="DLF">chimneys</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And the SS didn’t threaten them, they were very nice, they said you know we bring you to our <span class="DLF">farms</span> , because they have been told that if you are nice to people they will listen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">And they are there to undress and they said we are going out to a thing and by the time they got there they were already dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">September 1, 1943, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German ghetto</span> was completely surrounded by SS during the night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">QUESTION:  So we’re talking, was there still a division between Russian and German Jews at this point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  Yes, there was always. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">Heavy guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">We knew something was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">It was 5 o’clock in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And then Gruber gave order that all Jews had to assemble in one open <span class="NPIP">place</span> we had there in a <span class="DLF">Platz</span> (?) </span><span class="sentence" id="697">that is a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to and he said all healthy men step forward and he sent back my father who was already old, and other old men he sent back. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">But left were about 250 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">QUESTION:  Who stepped out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="700">ANSWER:  He put them separate and he said, I give you exactly half an hour, pack a small knapsack, you go ona special work commando. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Nothing will happen to you, you will be treated very well and say goodbye to your family, but you will come back and there is no problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">QUESTION:  What happened after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">ANSWER:  So after half an hour we said goodbye and very heavy SS guard came. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I’ve never seen more SS people in my whole life. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">We were 250 men, there must have been 100 SS people with machine guns, everything and we were marched out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which recently used to be a prisoner of war camp for the Russian prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">A small camp in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="707">I didn’t know the name, we didn’t know it existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">We didn’t know anything because we couldn’t walk around. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">There was four <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , actually <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> for horses, and there were already some people there, some Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">They said we come from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Smolensk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">And we got in and there was another SS commander. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">We were only <span class="DLF">borders</span> to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">And he said, well you will be here until your transport leaves. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">We asked where are we going? </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I do not know, I cannot tell you, you will get food and if you behave properly nothing will happen to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">And one person made a question, I don’t know what he asked, what about our wives? </span><span class="sentence" id="717">I tell you about your wife, he took his gun and bang.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="718">QUESTION:  And shot him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">You see. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">So, we were there, there was no straw, no nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Bare wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Of course, we were worried and we didn’t know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">We could soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">It was a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we were 500 prisoners and these people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Smolensk</span> told us that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Smolensk</span> has been closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">These were the last people they took out. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">Come on, this cannot be. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">Yes, he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Over the two years and then we realized this time it will happen to our people. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">But after three days, Mr. Gruber, the SS commander came and sad I have very good news for you, you can each write a note to your loved ones in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and if you have wives, if they want to join you, they will be permitted to join you here. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So I wrote to my family, a small piece of paper we had, we got, we didn’t have it and the pencil, I wrote I do not want Erika to come because this to me looks very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">I wrote in French and English, because I spoke a little English and French at that time because we didn’t figure if they would read it. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">And two days later I got a letter back from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from my family and Erica. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And Erica wrote, I am coming together with Hannah Lou’s sister who was married to Herman Haupman who lives now. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">We are coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And honestly, after six days about 50 women arrived all from the married men. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Also with the little knapsack. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And we said it cannot be so bad if they permit the women here. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">Maybe nothing to eat, probably, maybe nothing to sleep probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">But when you are in such a state, just to have somebody is already comforting. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">And that went on until September 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="742">QUESTION:  So you were there two weeks?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="743">ANSWER:  With a wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="744">QUESTION:  So Erika came, she was there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="745">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">And very early, on September 14, 1943, the SS commander of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> told us to get ready for transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">It was 5 in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">We all packed our little bag what we had, we went up we were not permitted to take anything with us, the men and the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">And he said the men to the left and the women to the right. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And he said, first we bring the men to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> and then the women so you can prepare already at least. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">And again under very heavy guards we were taken to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="752">That’s the last time I saw Erika or my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">The women never came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="754">QUESTION:  They never came with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="755">ANSWER:  Never. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">But when we went through the cities of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transporter</span> , 1t was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">SS van</span> or whatever it was, we passed the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And they must have heard something or seen and I saw the people still standing in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and greeting us. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">We couldn’t see them in person, but I saw them saying hello. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">I don’t know if my parents were there or not, you couldn’t look that far. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">So the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was still alive on September 14, 1943, 2,500 people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">If the Russian Jews were still there, I do not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">We didn’t pass by there. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And we were taken to a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> now. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">No heat, no straw, nothing, no food.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">QUESTION:  They didn’t give you any water either?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="766">ANSWER:  Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I think we were in the transport two or three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I honestly can’t remember right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">The <span class="DLF">doors</span> were never opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">They gave us one little pear, but you know a hundred people in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> that pear went over right away, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And then we stopped, we couldn’t look out, but all night long they would move that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> back and forth, like a football, you know, the people got completely, what should I say, it was abnormal, you know, you were pushed back and forth by tremendous force. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">They would (sound effect) and push. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">Then early in the morning the SS opened these <span class="DLF">cattle car doors</span> and they were standing there with the German shepherds and with the kapos and they shouted “Get out you dirty Jews, get out, run, run, run, get out, get out, run.” </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And we saw a <span class="DLF">gate</span> and it said <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And it said “Arbeit Mach Frei, the work will make you free.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="776">QUESTION:  And this was the middle of September?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="777">ANSWER:  This was probably the 17" or 18" of September, 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">And we came to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , we had to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">It was a terrible sweet smell. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">A terrible smell. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">We didn’t know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> was, we had no idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And we saw prisoners pulling tremendous loads, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with shoes and with clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And we were put separate on one <span class="NPIP">spot</span> , the 200, some had died, I don’t remember how many made it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">About 240 most probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And there were kapos and there were Dutch Jews and they told us where you from? </span><span class="sentence" id="786">I said we’re from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">They said this is the commando that meant this is the commando to <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="788">I said what are you talking about? </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Well, you will see, this is the commando to <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Do you have anything good with you? </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I said why? </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I need this. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">You don’t need it anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">They were one hundred per cent sure, these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> , we would be gassed too. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">So after a while, we were standing there about three hours, not permitted to go to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> , there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="796">After three hours an SS delegation came and said, are there any carpenters here? </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Yes, three carpenters. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Any locksmiths? </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Any plumbers? </span><span class="sentence" id="801">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Any electricians? </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">Get out, get out, get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And I, my friend Herman Hoffman was an electrician, he said to me, if they ask for locksmith next time, get out too. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">Locksmith? </span><span class="sentence" id="807">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">I knew about it, I was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">steam room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="809">I got out too. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">We took Otto Menkin with us and Herman and about hundred people went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And they said are there any gardeners? </span><span class="sentence" id="812">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Everybody went as a gardener. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">The gardeners we never saw again. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">But we were pushed on the side and we went to a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and we had to undress. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">We had still not prison uniforms but we had old clothes marked with _. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">So we had to undress. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">The little thing we had, here, here, here. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">We were searched from top to bottom. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Then we went into a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="822">We didn’t know what it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And we got out and then we came to a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where they gave us each one a new uniform and wooden shoes or something like this and then they said you will stay here and you will be transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deshov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">So the kapos said to us, that kapos, you are the first group that came in and goes out of here alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">So we still didn’t know what <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I never heard about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> before, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">But we heard the smell and he said this is a <span class="BUILDING">death factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="828">But you know, even getting from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , even seeing everything, we didn’t know what a <span class="BUILDING">death factory</span> was, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">We didn’t know, we didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">So in the evening they put us back on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle car</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Puchine</span> which wasn’t too far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Because the next morning we got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Puchine</span> was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration work camp</span> , a very small camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And we worked for the <span class="BUILDING">Heinkel factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="834">This was taken over by the, this used to be <span class="BUILDING">Polish airplane factory</span> , taken over by the Germans and we got there was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp and</span> this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp was,</span> there were about 250 Polish Jews and women there. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">And just before we got there, the SS had executed all the children there by beheading them. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And the <span class="DLF">grave</span> , you know the mothers and fathers had to watch, there were about fifty children. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">So we got there, the Polish Jews did not like the German Jews, they called us the Yekkas. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">There was always friction, but they were in command. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">And we were put to work there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Puchine</span> in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and then the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">This lasted about, I would think, four or six months. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I can’t remember I have to look it up in my book. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">If you wait a minute I can get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">You want me to make sure of the dates?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="844">QUESTION:  Sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">ANSWER:  It was from September 17 to April 21, 1944, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Puchine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="846"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Puchine</span> was then closed down because the Russians came already near, you see, and we were shipped to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scechochw</span> , and this was from April to July in 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">These were all <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camps</span> for the <span class="BUILDING">Heinkel factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="848">But the Russians came closer again and when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> left the machine guns hit the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , but they got the Jews out. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">You see we were one hundred per cent sure that we would be liberated, but they got us out just before they got there. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">As a matter of fact the SS commander, two or three Polish Jews escaped that night or ten people. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">In the morning we thought we would all be killed, there was already machine guns around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">QUESTION:  Because they had escaped?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="853">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">He said how many escaped? </span><span class="sentence" id="855">Ten, that’s all, I thought more. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">He has no guts, you know, he was already sick and tired of this, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="857">QUESTION:  Now what did you do in the first <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Puchine</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">ANSWER:  We worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">I worked as a locksmith. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I don’t remember exactly what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">Because I was very strong at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">First we had to transport in the beginning this was a work force to repair the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and we have to move these things and the equipment and, of course, they took the young men to move these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And only later on did they try to put us really in <span class="NPIP">places</span> to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">But nothing was ever accomplished there, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">No <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> ever left there. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">But these were small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration work camps</span> , you understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">They had SS guards and the SS commandos. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">But in general you worked from 6-6 but you got soup, proper soup at night and a slice of bread, and because the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> became smaller, it was bad enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">But we got __ in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deshov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">They took us to a <span class="INT_SPACE">public bath</span> every four weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">The Heinkel Work insisted that the prisoner shouldn’t have lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">They paid for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">I think they paid fifty pfenigs a day for us or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Puchine went to September and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Deshov</span> went from April to July 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And that also had to be closed down because the Russians came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">QUESTION:  And where did you go after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="877">ANSWER:  And then we were taken to a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plaszow</span> , which was built on the former <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="878">It was mostly <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">women camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Women were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Jewish women. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">This was a tremendous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> one of the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="882">That commander, SS commander, only walked around in a white silk suit. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">And he would kill the women like nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">We had one <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="885">You know what a <span class="INT_SPACE">latrine</span> is? </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Women and men together. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">There was no difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Absolutely no difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">And we finally, somebody put a wooden plank in between us. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And we had very very bad kapos there and SS people too. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">But we were only there a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">Because by now we were so called expert workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="893">So from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Plaszow</span> , after five days, we were sent to the <span class="DLF">salt mines</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wieliczka</span> , but they did not put us to work but it was the worst <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> I think because everything was dirt, you know from the salt and from the prisoners who worked there, never made it more than four to six weeks, they told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">And because they couldn’t use us there, they sent us to a tremendous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> , a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a very big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="895">That was in August of ’44. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And there the SS commandant when we came in he asked, we were very dirty and in a long transport for the day, he asked, the kapos, where do these prisoners come from? </span><span class="sentence" id="897">And the kapos said they are Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="898">He said Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="899">Jews only walk in, they go out in the <span class="DLF">chimney</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">This was a tremendous <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> very clean, very orderly, but terrible kapos. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">The German kapos hated us. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">The Polish kapos, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">And we were put, just to give you an example, where to undress, this was high in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , we had to undress, we had to run into a <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> and this was originally the <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> , and the kapos said that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And we didn’t know what would happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="905">QUESTION:  The kapos said you would die?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="906">ANSWER:  Yes, because it was a <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chamber</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">But they also had water faucets there on the <span class="DLF">ceiling</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">But in our case, the boiling water came out and you couldn’t move anywhere, we came out like lobsters into the ice cold weather, but we got out. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">And the kapos didn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">I only give happy thoughts because I couldn’t tell you the whole thing, you can read everything here. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">So in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> , after about three weeks, we were not put to work, we were put in into a special <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">There were no other Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">There was a camp of about twenty thousand prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="914">QUESTION:  Mostly they were political prisoners?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="915">ANSWER:  Political, Galitziana, homosexuals, no Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">We were the first Jews that came in and the first Jews that go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">But what happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> , it’s an interesting story. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">One day they put out of the 250 men were not all German Jews, they were Russian Jews, Polish Jews, but now there may be 200 left. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">One morning they called, all German Jews to the barracks A. That was where the commanding was sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Hands up, and we figured that’s it, we didn’t know what to make out of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">And all of a sudden somebody pushed me and said, Jew, come <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="922">There was no dead man, or the SS man or the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">typewriter</span> and he asked, your name? </span><span class="sentence" id="923">I said Heinz Ludwig Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Idiot, you are Heinz Ludwig Israel Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">Yes sir. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Where you born? </span><span class="sentence" id="927">So and so. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">Where your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="929">What’s your nationality? </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I said I am stateless. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">You are German. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">All of a sudden I am German again. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">You never knew where to take these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">What did you learn, what did you do, and so and so? </span><span class="sentence" id="935">Wrote everything down. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">Out! </span><span class="sentence" id="937">Next one. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">I tell you why this is important to tail this on the end of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">Everybody, German Jews were registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="941">Don’t ask me. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">It was Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">Then, about three weeks later one morning, they said Block, everything with loud speakers, Block 420 or whatever our <span class="DLF">block</span> was, you do not go to work, you report to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And the kapos hated the Jews, he said good, get rid of you Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">And the <span class="DLF">gate</span> is a real commander today, out. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">We each got a piece of bread and a piece of liverwurst. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">And we’re standing and standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">I was so hungry J ate, little, little, little, and 5 o’clock the SS man came with a big basket to collect the wurst and bread because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> didn’t come. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">And somebody said I don’t have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">Don’t have it, stand out. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">So when he came to me I said sergeant, I ate mine I was so hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Why do you speak such good German? </span><span class="sentence" id="953">I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Next one. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">He didn’t do anything to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">Somehow, you know, there was all a matter of luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">From <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> we were transported to the other part of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colmar</span> , which was in the French , 1n the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="958">It was in August of ’44. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">And this transport was not guarded by SS men, but by disabled German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">And they told us, they left the <span class="DLF">gate doors</span> open, and they said the war is over.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="961">QUESTION:  In August of ’44 they said this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="962">ANSWER:  They said, the war is over, that’s the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">What have you done that you are 1n <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Because we had prison uniforms by now. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">We said we are Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Oh, don’t worry, it’s all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And they were basically not brutal with whips and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">They were German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And we came to this little camp in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colmar</span> which was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> also prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="970">QUESTION:  So you went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Colmar</span> in August of ’44, a couple days later to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Urbis</span> to dig the <span class="DLF">tunnel</span> through...

<p><span class="sentence" id="980">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">We were also again put in a special <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> because we were the only Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="982">We were next to the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> of people who were condemned to die. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">Every week they collected prisoners should die. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Every Saturday they had about 250 executions in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="985">We were next to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">But you could not talk to these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">It was completely surrounded by wire, <span class="DLF">barbed wire</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">You couldn’t talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">But we saw them. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">They were all shackled together, foot and things day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">And they were permitted half an hour to march around in their little extra things. </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And they had crosses here and crosses here and crosses here, ready for death. </span><span class="sentence" id="993">Every Saturday morning the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> would come and throw these people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">kapos</span> , and that’s it. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">And then they collect again. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">We were in the next <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and that’s why we knew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">And in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> we were put to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">We were put to work to dig out the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> that were bombed by the British or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">American planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="998">Heavy guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">But we had to clean or dig or whatever we had to do.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1000">QUESTION:  When you came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhauser</span> , when was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1001">ANSWER:  October ’44. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">We were about one month in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> , or maybe six weeks, I don’t remember, I have to look it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">Dates are hard to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Tape 2, Side | When we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> we were unloaded near the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> and we were put, not near the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> , maybe an hour from where they build the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> and these things, A small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> with a very cool SS commander who hanged some people there, every day they were hanging. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">I remember that especially. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">And every morning at 5 0’clock we were put on a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">barge</span> , ice cold, and we were brought to the <span class="BUILDING">place of work</span> because it was an hour away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">We had to work there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I worked as a plumber or a locksmith, I don’t remember what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">I can’t remember exactly what I did any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">But I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And there were German men who were the people who worked all the time and we had to help them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">And some of them were very nice and others would report your number to the SS and at night you came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and they would call you out and you got twenty- five on your behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">You never knew when, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">So I only later on I was put in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish barrack</span> and one day I came back from work, the SS commander told me that he had found a knife in my <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and I would get twenty five on my behind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">And every man of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> got ten and every single Jew got one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">But I got twenty- five and you had to count. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">You didn’t count you got the whip. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">It was given to me by a Polish kapo, there were two Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">They were the worst Jew haters I ever see in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">They were Russian prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Later on before this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liquidated, these two Russian prisoners were stoned to death by the other prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">And when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> came to an end, we again went on transport and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , the inferno of infernos.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1023">QUESTION:  Do you remember when you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1024">ANSWER:  We got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> approximately the end of March, I think.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1025">QUESTION:  Of °45?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1026">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1027">QUESTION:  So you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> from late ’44 to early ’45?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1028">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> was the worst I’ve seen besides <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">Thirty thousand dead bodies on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">Only because I was still able to work we transported, the Germans wanted to clean up that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and we had to transport the dead bodies, decomposed bodies, to the <span class="DLF">mass grave</span> that day, and all of a sudden only and you couldn’t get out of <span class="DLF">line</span> , and my best friend Kurt Spitzkopf, with whom I went together all the time from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , all of a sudden, while we were, he said, Heinz, there’s my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">His mother was killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">I said, good, your mother is dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">My mother is dead, my mother (sound effect of machine gun), you couldn’t stop him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">So most of the people from my commando died in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">But when we were liberated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> we were about, I think 10 people left from the 250 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1037">QUESTION:  You mean liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1038">ANSWER:  Yeah, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1039">QUESTION:  When were you liberated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1040">ANSWER:  April 15, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">I was 75 pounds, typhus, blood clot, TB. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">I only saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">British tank</span> coming in and then I collapsed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">I was very very sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">It took a year and a half to recuperate.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1045">QUESTION:  So you went to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> after the war?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1046">ANSWER:  No, you see, then when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was liberated and the British came in they didn’t know what to do with these people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">So first they had to eliminate all the dead people and then they opened the <span class="BUILDING">SS barracks</span> and the soldiers and they made temporary <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">We were so sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">Most people died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">Ten thousand people died after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">So I was lucky and they brought me to this <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">My legs were like this, with blood clots, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">But, one day a British doctor came and they called a very expert and he said no, no, it’s not so bad he will live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">That’s what I understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">But then one day the British came around about in May or the beginning of June and said there are transports to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , and we will put you on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">So when they asked me what is your nationality, I thought I would be proud and say I am a German Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">He said no German Jews because we don’t know if you’re a Jew or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">I said I’m a Jew, my name is Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">So the next time they came around I was a little smarter. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">Said, what is your name Uh, huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">What is your nationality? </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">Stateless? </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">Uh huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">So they shipped me to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1066">QUESTION:  So they wouldn’t take German Jews to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1067">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">Not in the beginning because they were not sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">You see they thought maybe these SS people, they couldn’t be sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">The Polish could speak Polish, the French talked French, the Italians speak Italian. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I couldn’t speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">My broken English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">Ve vant bread, yah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">You know, you see I didn’t know at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">So they took us to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">I was unconscious, but when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> I never forget that and I saw all these blond Swedish people, they all volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077"><span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> took in 30,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">They emptied out the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">I don’t know how many <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> took in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">I don’t know how many of <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082"><span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> took some and sent them back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">But when I saw these nurses I thought this is the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">I thought really these long <span class="BUILDING">tents</span> must be the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> to <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> because I was conscious and unconscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">And these nurses looked at me and they said Swedish language, look at the little boy here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">They knew there was nothing here nothing there, 75 or 80 pounds at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">But what happened at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , coming back to the registration in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> , my cousin, Albert Hottenberg just called, he was a high officer under Eisenhower and he liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and when he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Flossenberg</span> and he saw this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1088">QUESTION:  He saw your name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1089">ANSWER:  He looked for Rosenberg, he Heinz Rosenberg (sound effects) and it says Heinz Rosenberg shipped to here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">And he traced me to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> he was able to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">Not that he saw me in person, but he knew I’m either dead in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> or alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">So we were in these big <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> from the German soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">I couldn’t walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">I had diarrhea. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">I couldn’t get out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">So I heard somebody shouting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">Hey Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">But you know I couldn’t go to the <span class="DLF">window</span> , nobody could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">I come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> a couple of years later, I get in contact with my cousin, my other cousin said Albert lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">One day my wife and I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> to see Otto and we go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Baltimore</span> to see my cousin Albert and he says Heinz, I don’t understand you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , didn’t you hear me with a loud speaker in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">I was very sick, I didn’t hear anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">I went there with an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">army jeep</span> with three American soldiers with a big loud speaker calling for Heinz Rosenberg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">I would have taken you to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> and made you the Mayor of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Honestly that is what he wanted to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">He was in command. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">He had the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">He was a high officer under Eisenhower, because he had jumped while still the war was going on over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gottingen</span> in German uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">He was a typical German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">My cousin is a good tall looking man, typical German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">He was German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">So, I didn’t meet him there, but I met him here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">And we are still very good friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">But this other coincidence in life only because the Germans took my card and file did he find me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">It’s unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">But you see, this here what I am giving you 1s all written here in this book, and I will give you a book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And, you see, it is very very impossible to explain all the cruelties and all the tragedies and all that went on in these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> because the normal person cannot feel and understand what went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">I happen to be a man who went through thirteen <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">Sometimes I think I’m not really alive, it’s a dream that I am still here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">I wasn’t supposed to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">I was in front of machine guns, I was in <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> , we were put out again in . </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">You can read all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">To tell you my story is not important, but to tell you the story of the six million Jews and fourteen million Russians and Polish and other people who have been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">It is absolutely a necessity that the world should know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">Only by knowing the facts can we build a better world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">If we don’t do it, the world will blow itself up. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And I don’t care if you are a Jew or gentile, black, white, yellow, whatever you are, I don’t care, I don’t mean you in person, the people you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">If the world doesn’t realize that this hatred and this crime and this dirt has to stop, then they will destroy themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">I am at the age, maybe I’m lucky, I have another fifteen years, it’s not so important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">But, for my children and grandchildren and for all the children and grandchildren in this world there should be some kind of more understanding from all the peoples to know what went on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">It’s very hard to, you know, what should I tell you, how people starve to death, it wouldn’t make sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">This you can read in books. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">I can only tell you my story and my story is not important. </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">I am alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">But the story of my parents, my sister, my first wife, all my friends, all the Jews from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> , all the Jews from <span

they hanged them, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bremen</span> they hanged them, all over they gassed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">I am one of the few people who can talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">Ihave a very good memory. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">I hold this book in order that people should know what went on, that’s why I am willing to give you this book. </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">I didn’t write it for myself, I know the stories, I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">But the people who were not there, they should learn from it, you see, otherwise we will destroy ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">This hatred has to stop somewhere and there is still tremendous hatred in this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">Tremendous hatred and jealousy, whatever it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">So I am trying to do my little part in order to bring a little bit of more understanding and peace to this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">That the whole story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">I am an expert on <span
