<p><span class="sentence" id="245">QUESTION:  And was a point where you left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  Yes, I had a cousin named Erik Forst(ph), who was born in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , but he moved to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> in 1939, so he was not a prisoner in any of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">French concentration camps</span> like his family was. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">So he, his mother and his sister lived somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , I do not know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">But all of a sudden he started showing up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> , and he was dressed brilliantly, he was dressed like an undercover Nazi or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">Now what do I mean by that? </span><span class="sentence" id="250">He was dressed in — in boots, high thigh boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">He was dir — dressed in — in flowery pants, horseback riding type pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">He was dressed in a shirt, and tie and a jacket, and wearing a French beret. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> were just not dressed like that, this was immaculate dressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">So over the years as I got older, I-I’ve always want —I remember every time he took a step that his boots creaked, the leather in his new boots creaked, I remember the sound 65 years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And I wondered over the June 9, 2009 years, you know, what was this all about? </span><span class="sentence" id="256">But cousin Erik came to see us frequently in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and he could have sa — he had safe passage in and out of the main <span class="DLF">gate</span> and no one stopped him or challenged him. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">So I got to thinking, you know, maybe he was acting the part of some Gestapo agent or something, and nobody wanted to mess with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">But actually what he did, he came to visit us in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and his plan was to plan an escape for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">So one dark night, my parents and I and my father’s brother Leopold, and his wife Carrie and his son Kurt, who was a year and a half older than me, we all headed to the back of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and my father gave the French — the French guard two packs of cigarettes and he turned his back. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And we went through the barbed wife, down a short <span class="DLF">ravine</span> and to a <span class="DLF">dirt road</span> where my cousin Erik had an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">automobile</span> and a driver waiting, and we piled into that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">My parents and his brother and his wife and Kurt piled into the back, that was five people, and cousin Erik jumped in front next to the driver, and I jumped in front next to cousin Erik and the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So that was eight people in — in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , I’m sure we were a tight fit. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And we took off in the dark of night without lights and my cousin Erik kept barking, ouvrir les lumiéres, fermer les lumiéres, meaning open the lights and close the lights, and we drove like that all night long according to what cousin Erik called for, and the driver obeyed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And we drove for two nights, in the daytime we hid. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And eventually we reached a June 9, 2009 small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> by the name of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Caussade</span> , where cousin Erik had picked out a small <span class="DLF">farm</span> for us to hide in and live. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And we had, on this small <span class="DLF">farm</span> we had, which was on top of a <span class="DLF">hill</span> , we had one horse, one cow, one dog, chickens, ducks, geese and penned rabbits, which were our dinner. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And we grew food, we grew — grew corn, we grew potatoes, we grew all kinds of vegetables, we grew grapes, and we su- subsisted on that <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And we were on that <span class="DLF">farm</span> about seven months before all of a sudden, a number of different French police types started to show up. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">And my parents, seeing them come up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> from below, ordered me to go lay in the <span class="DLF">corn field</span> and hide, they shouldn’t count all — be able to count all of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">And one day there was so many of them that came, that — and they were stay there so long that I fell asleep in the <span class="DLF">cornfield</span> , and when they had left, my parents couldn’t find me and they were on a hunt calling Manfred, Manfred, you know on the — finally I woke up. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But soon after that, they came with the German police, the Gestapo, and they rea — rearrested all of us and sent us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Rivesaltes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">The men were so dangerous, obviously, that within this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> they had another <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">Within the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> they had another <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , and they put the men in my family in that <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And it was extraordinary and I remember that very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">QUESTION:  Let’s go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Caussade</span> for a few minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">You lived on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> and you — and your parents farmed it? </span><span class="sentence" id="277">June 9, 2009

<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  Were you in contact with the local population?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  We went into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> on a daily basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">My parents and Kurt’s parents lived on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="284">My cousin Erik, his mother and his sister lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they rented the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> type thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So cousin Kurt and I, we had to do the ob — driving him into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> with our horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and picking him up in the morning on the daily basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So that was our contact in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">We also wa-wandered into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> occasionally, and sat along the general <span class="DLF">park area</span> where men had outdoor restaurants or — or <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And we sat among them, we didn’t buy anything to eat, we didn’t have any money. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">But, we really didn’t talk to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">The only one that talked to any of the local people was cousin Erik. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">He was very friendly with the local police. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And over the years, after they rearrested us and send us back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Camp Rivesaltes</span> , I was always wondering, you know, would cousin Erik have anything to do with getting us rearrested, because he was so friendly with the local police there. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I mean, you mind wanders, and you think — but no, that was not the case, they — they just tracked us down. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And cousin Erik, apparently, I learned many years later, got warning from his friend in the police that the Gestapo was coming June 9, 2009 to pick us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And in those days there were no telephones to call the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , or any communications, so cousin Erik hightailed it and — and they — we got caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">So — and as I re-revisited Caussade 60 years later, the chief of police told me that Erik had been told that they were coming for us, and that he escaped and — over the <span class="DLF">Spanish border</span> , and came back after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">How true that is, I — I can’t vouch for, but that’s what the local chief of police told me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">QUESTION:  Do you remember what it was like when the local police and the Gestapo came to get you from the <span class="DLF">farm</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  The only thing I remember about Spanish children is I got sick in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rivesaltes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I had some kind of a chest disease, where I was being treated, where they put bottles, heated with cans, and put them on — on my back. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I have no idea what it June 9, 2009 was, but it must have been pretty bad at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">And in that <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> they gave me a little bit of milk, which was very difficult to get in — in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="326">And I was somewhat weak, so I didn’t finish my milk, and I put it at the head of my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And had this Spanish boy who was also in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and he made his way on my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and tried to s-steal that milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">And that was the very first fight that I ever remember being in as a boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">I smacked that boy in the lip, and I said, get out of here, that’s mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">And that’s what I remember of any Spanish boys in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">The Spanish mainly were people who hung around the perimeter of the barbed wire around the outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , who at times provided food for us, if we had a little money to purchase it, such as perhaps a can of beans, or if you were lucky, one egg. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">And — and nobody had a lot of money so the-they — but there were a lot of people there, so they had a ni — a—a chance to sell small pieces of fruit to people, a piece of fruit. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And people were able to cook it like a boy scout over la — over a fire made over rocks, and we can put a tin can on the rocks and — and boil whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">I remember my mother was cooking a can of beans one time over such a rock system, which a — rather a lot of people were able to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And I was playing around that, and I knocked that can of beans over, and that was a disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">And it was — it was just — just — just a disaster. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">That can of bean would have been a feast for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Also, these combination of French and June 9, 2009 Spanish people, since we had no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> to sleep on, we slept on the <span class="INT_SPACE">concrete floor</span> with a little bit of straw under us, if we could find some. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">They built a primitive wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> for someone who had a — a few cents, I-I have no idea what they sold it for, but they were — sold quite a few of them, so — and they were nothing that you would want to sleep on, but for an inmate to sleep off the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , you know, like 10 inches off the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> rather than on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> was a — was a — just awesome.</span></p>
