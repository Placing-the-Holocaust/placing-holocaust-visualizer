<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER: I'm Paul A. Strassman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION: Where were you born and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER: I was born, uh, January 24th, 1929 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> [Ger: <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Trentschin</span> ] in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , which at that part...time was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION: You can look at me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER: OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">OK.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">QUESTION: Uh, Paul, would you tell me about your parents and your family, your family life as a young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">ANSWER: Uh my father uh was a very successful commander of the local battalion in the First World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">He was one of the very early educated, university educated, uh, young people so he immediately in the First World War got a commission in the Austro-Hungarian Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">In those days the army consisted of local battalions, people from the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , from the same <span class="REGION">province</span> went together; and, uh, that goes back to the feudal ways, how armies were organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Uh, my father, uh, brought many of the people from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">local district</span> back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> alive and, uh, after the First World War, he took his non-commissioned officers and, uh, set up a business where the non-commissioned officers from his battalion became his distributors and my father was the wholesaler, and by 1930 my father dominated the, uh, the oil, fertilizer and, uh, uh, flour distribution business in the, in the entire <span class="REGION">province</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">In the, uh, mid-thirties, my father became a member of the, uh, provincial government, which was a part of...1t was a sort of supervisory government on top of the bureaucracy and, uh, he became very closely associated with two priests, who, uh, subsequently figure very importantly in the events that happened sub...in the in the forties, and, uh, so my childhood was really, uh... as the only son...I had an older sister...of a very well-known public figure, and, uh, from my childhood I was aware of my father's position and his military background, which again will figure very importantly in, in the events to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My mother and, uh, my father worked together in the business. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">They were very close partners. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">The business was downstairs and we lived upstairs and, uh, I went to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">It was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish elementary school</span> , and had the usual normal childhood until, uh, 1936 when I decided to join HaShomer HaTzair, which was a youth organization which, uh, had very strong, uh, views of its, of its role in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , especially with regard to the notion of HaShomer being the guardian. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">Again, this is an important heritage because HaShomer HaTzair, uh, provided the backbone of all the Jewish guerrillas in, uh, <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">It it was sort of assumed that, uh, HaShomer HaTzair will fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">QUESTION: How did you as a young man feel about it and, uh, why did you become involved in it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">ANSWER: Involved with what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION: HaShomer HaTzair.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER: Oh, it's just uh...I don't know...you go with a certain crowd, uh, in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">The...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> is a Small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">It's it's a provincial head...uh, center of fourteen thousand people. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">The Jewish population in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was about fourteen hundred. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Uh, there were not that many organizations and HaShomer HaTzair was very well organized and it was the organization and the people and, uh, the young people I gravitated to. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">The other group was a religious group and, uh, although my mother was very religious and was kosher and my grandfather always took me to <span class="BUILDING">schul</span> , and I was a particularly good scholar, uh, my father and I were always sort of fairly, uh, liberal in our views from from the very childhood and therefore it was in...in...1ncomprehensible for me to join the the the religious part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">In fact the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> were really divided into three sort of groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">There were the the sort of conservative. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">Of course, this doesn't apply to the American definition of conservative. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Uh there was reform conservative and then there was really the extremely religious Jews; and uh being uh very much involved in a community and uh with a father as a public figure and uh and particularly leader of HaShomer HaTzair in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> uh who had quite a bit of training in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Palmach</span> , uh we we sort of were set up for this this kind of an experience.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION: Tell me what happened to you as uh as things began to change in your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER: Uh we had a...a very difficult decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">We were going to leave in uh 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">My father decided uh to leave and we were all set up to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">We had passports and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  What?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER: Uh my father was a fairly astute individual and he felt that the situation was untenable and becoming more so. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Uh he uh uh interpreted the the the the experiences in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> uh much more correctly than others did and he just did not feel that he wanted to to risk his family uh to the uh to the sort of experience that was happening in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and uh so we were going to leave uh the uh...we were sort of stashing money away. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">My my mother, who was always the treasurer of the uh of the, of the family...as we got money and change it into foreign currency ... you know, uh mother took it and put it into a a metal box which she uh hid upstairs in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="42">The week when we were supposed to leave in 1938, she went up to withdraw the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">The box had fallen behind a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">radiator</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="44">It was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steam radiator</span> ; nevertheless the metal box focused the heat out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steam radiator</span> and all the money that was in there, which was our escape money, was charred and my father never said a bad word about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">In addition to that, there were uncles and grandparents and the whole family...my father was sort of the kapo of the family, I mean in the in the uh in the grand...godfather kind of a style...I mean there was a whole series of retinues, and uh uh my father, although he could have left totally poor and destitute uh between having no money at all and uh and uh the fact that there were just too many people who we couldn't take with us, my father decided to stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">So that what happened in'38. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">In '39 uh we uh started uh looking at the way how to change our relationships and at that time my father anticipated that the business would be taken away so he started uh really working with one of his confidants to divest himself of the business and in that respect my father was very forward looking. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">Of course when when the extreme measures came and particularly the legislation which started in, late in 1940 uh which was a very elaborate process for uh expropriating the Jews before destroying them, uh my father was sufficiently skilled to uh to uh divest himself of things before people divested him of tt. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">In addition to that his relationships with the uh two priests who were prominent including the Catholic priest, a man by the name of Branecky, who just by coincidence was in the same <span class="BUILDING">seminary</span> as Dr. Joseph Tiso, who became the quisling president of <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , uh Branecky assured him that whatever will happen to Jews, uh Branecky personally protect my father because of the services my father has rendered to the community, so uh we in many respects always anticipated the losses that were coming and uh we divested of property. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">We moved out of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">Uh, we moved uh started moving into less and less uh proper <span class="INT_SPACE">quarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">We ultimately ended in a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> , sort of in the slums of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> but but uh at least the, the family stayed together and uh although the cousins and the nieces and the uh in-laws were all deported in '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">My father couldn't protect them anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Uh, my father, uh, with the protection of Branecky got a presidential writ which protected my father uh from deportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">My father continued working in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> which was economically very important for for <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> because still of the distribution of oil and fertilizer and flour, so my father continued actually managing the enterprise.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION: Can you pause a little bit?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER: Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION: Uh Paul, tell us what it was like in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren</span> _in from 1940, 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">You have described what was happening to your family, but I'd like to know a little bit more about what was happening in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , what life was like for you as a young man during that period.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">ANSWER: Well, my life was revolving around uh the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and HaShomer HaTzair and uh as 1940 came to pass, uh there were restrictions where you could go for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">There were certain <span class="NPIP">places</span> where we could not go hiking anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">Uh, you couldn't go to movies. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">By 1940 the radios were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Um... by 1941 you couldn't have a telephone. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">Uh by uh early 1941 the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> had to collapse itself, all of its grades, into a small <span class="BUILDING">classroom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I mean there was continual, almost monthly, new regulation and proscriptions and prescriptions of what you could or couldn't do. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Uh by 1941 you had to wear a yellow star, and that meant that when you walked down the <span class="DLF">street</span> uh when the local ruffians wanted to beat you up, uh they just beat you up. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Of course that led to the fact that we always went together as crowd. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I mean there were no rough tactics like using knives or anything like that...1t was just uh sticks and fists. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">So, you know, 1940, 1941 uh was conversion of HaShomer HaTzair into sort of a youth gang. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Uh from a childhood standpoint actually, uh it was a wonderful experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">It sort of made things very intense and very important, and suddenly things became just very very ... things which you would not have believed were important became very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">For instance uh most of the Jews had to get rid of their books. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">You were not allowed to have books. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I mean there's lots of things...you couldn't have this, this and that, so the notion that you could read a book, or that somebody owned a book, was a matter of great importance because if you could borrow a book uh and you had a book or you had access to somebody who borrowed your book, that was subject of very very much conversation--who reads what. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">It became a very intense kind of a life...uh life became very precious. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Uh so so I'm not looking at that period in fact uh with with dismay. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">It became a very very intensive life where every moment mattered and everything mattered, and you became very cautious and very very forward looking, very calculating, and very well organized, so.... Of course by the end of 1940 or early in 1941, the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> was dissolved. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Uh, it just happened that my father arranged for some people, and and there were some refugees, to to start tutoring me at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ; so starting in 1941, I had private tutors including some very distinguished uh people who otherwise would have, I would never have met in terms of education. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">Uh I started studying English in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I had an excellent uh English teacher from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">I didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We were not allowed to have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> , but uh the local music teacher who was the wife of a local judge let me practice on her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">It it's that sort of experiences ... they are they are sort of savoring life and savoring experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Uh, you know, sure I got beaten up, but we also beat up some of them too, I mean, so uh we learned how to do dirty fighting and kicking. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Uh we did not always run. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Most of the time we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Uh and the relationship between the the the young people, I mean the people with whom I was in those days uh...I mean and and one of them is in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , one of them is 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , one of them is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> , and they're all over the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">I can pick up the phone and talk to them like I can talk to nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Uh, a few months ago one of these boys who was with me uh wrote me a letter and in the letter he just mentioned that he has tremendous headaches and uh that uh the doctors in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> can't find out what's wrong with him, so I get the letter uh in the morning, I call up uh the other boy who was part of the group in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , and I said, uh, Sano has headaches. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">If I send him by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> tomorrow morning to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Goteborg</span> can you take care...can you take him to a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">He said of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">You know, it's like, you know, you know, like like continuing the same conversation of fifty years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I pick up the phone. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I call Sano in Europe, I said there is a ticket waiting for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Uh you just walk down the <span class="DLF">street</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">travel agency</span> and hop on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> and Francl will pick you up at the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Now he hasn't seen Francl in fifty years, but, you know, it was just...it's that kind of a relationship. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">I, I don't have with nobody...I, I wouldn't pick up a phone like that with anybody else except my nearest family or my children, so you know, coming back to the forties and you want to get the spirit...it's, it's life of great intensity. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">It's life of great, uh, changing of outlook. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Things become very precious, very important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION: And uh the noose then begins to tighten. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">What happens...
ANSWER: And as the noose becomes tightened, of course, then uh, you know, when the deportations start and this this is very ugly, uh but it's very bureaucratized. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">You know, the lists are made up, and, and, and in fact the the Jewish council administers the list, so the the Gestapo has just a few people. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Then they have the Hlinka Guards, the quislings, and then you have the local gendarmes, and the whole thing is organized as a machine, and the machine uh because of its bureaucratic approach, becomes predictable which means that if you're skillful and if you have pull, uh you can anticipate the motions and then you can almost figure out the odds of survival and so life becomes on the part of my father very much preoccupied with understanding which way the laws are going and what do you give up in order to protect, so in 1942 when the uh deportations begin, my father is uh advised that, "Yes, we can protect you but if you would get baptized uh it would look better because it would allow us to reclassify you from column 4BC to column 4DA which is a different priority." </span><span class="sentence" id="105">See, by that time uh the whole question of destruction becomes an arithmetic calculation. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Who owes what favor to whom, what can you do to protect. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And by the way, that is the sort of mentality that continues afterwards under the communist regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">It it is not just a Holocaust experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">It is a totalitarian experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">It's a Kafka's, Kafka-like experience, except it's accentuated because now the game becomes deadly, so my father said fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">You know, you want to reclassify. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We get baptized. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">I just got bar mitzvah in January '42, so then Father comes back and said you know, and we have to get baptized. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Fine Dad. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">You know, how do we do that? </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Well, you know, uh we have to sort of get the thing organized and you have to qualify. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">We cannot get you into the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> because it takes too long and it requires Archbishop dispensation and it would take a couple of years, but uh you can get baptized in the <span class="BUILDING">Evangelic Church</span> , which was a <span class="BUILDING">Protestant church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Uh and the Protestants are more flexible because of the heritage and we can do the whole thing in eight months and you have to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and learn the catechism and so forth, so part of the experience is one of how to survive in a totalitarian environment, how to adapt, how to change your skins, your habits, your behavior, because that 1s what the rules require.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION: How did you go about it? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">How did this process of becoming —__ educated to become baptized, how did tt...
ANSWER: Oh there is a procedure for that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION: I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But how did...yes, I understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">What I want to know is what did Paul Strassman do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER: Oh, I, I, I'm, I'm a I'm a very skillful, highly disciplined young man who can concentrate, and if you have to learn the catechism and you have to learn the New Testament, uh, you know, it's it's a drill like learning anything else, so you know, if you have to learn things in order to get...you have to learn the tfillin to get bar bar mitzvah and read the Tanach to be bar mitzvah, well fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They want me to do something else, I can do that too. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">It's, it's, uh, it's an adaptability, so if they want, you know...now they want me to jump through this loop, I'll go through this loop. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">If they want me to jump through this <span class="DLF">hoop</span> , it that, it the price of survival and you know the calculation of this thing...you know classifica...reclassification from 4AB to 4DE means that you have another year to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And if that's what it takes, that's what you do. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So it is the mental process that I'm trying to convey to you is that the genocide is a bureaucratic process with stipulated rules which all have escape clauses and that is not just genocide although it's, again let me emphasize, genocide is deadly. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">But it is a process which is almost banal in its bureaucratic predictability and manipulability and those who survive are the individuals who either have the power or the money and the know-how, but you have to have all three in order to be able to deal with that system. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Now uh there are <span class="NPIP">places</span> where there is no escape clauses. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">When you're dealing with the Gestapo there is no escape clauses. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Although even there there are escape clauses of sorts. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Uh of course they are at a completely different level, but under the <span class="REGION">Slovak Republic</span> which basically was a corrupt republic, um and uh a republic that always wanted to have an alibi for certain people...you know, there was...you always built an alibi for the next thing and if somebody's powerful and is protected by Branecky, well he must be important. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">If you want to preserve your options in the <span class="REGION">Slovak Republic</span> you can navigate through that uh that uh environment and and if you know how to do it, you can survive a little longer than somebody else who does not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">The Jews who are deported in '42 are the powerless, the uh...they are the true victims. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">They are the ones who are not going to fit into the society very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">QUESTION: Did you see those deportations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER: Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">You know, the the lists were drawn up....
QUESTION: I'd like you to describe one deportation that you saw for us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER: Well, you you, there is a list that is drawn up and you know the night before from the friendly local gendarmes who is on the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">OK? </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Uh some people don't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Some people who are on the list don't find out, but if you are connected, you find out. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">There's always the last moments scurrying around, you know...can I get off the list? </span><span class="sentence" id="149">In '42 there's still the presumption, well we are just going from a very bad situation to just a worse situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">We are going to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">The whole question of <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> and so forth is is absolutely not known in '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Uh all the subsequent evidence shows that that uh that that some of the evidence is coming in at late '42, early '43 and that is being hidden, but in '42 the idea of deportation is just we're going to the next level of negotiation. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Now we're going to be entren...no, we already gave up, we already went through twelve circles of <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And so well, there's just another circle of <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">OK, well what else can they do? </span><span class="sentence" id="158">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Uh of course the the war doesn't look very good in '42, so uh the whole notion of going into any sort of resistance is totally utopian except under very extreme conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Uh there is already the first group of Jews who go into the uh <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> with arms in '42.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION: Are you...were you and your father aware of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER: I wasn't, but my father was. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And my father, considering the military situation and the fact that the front was, you know, a thousand, two hundred kilometers away and there was nothing on the west, my father's military assessment was, you know, this is an option that uh that is a, you know, this is the twelve... twentieth level of <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="164">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">But the survivability of a family uh, you know...and at that time I'm thirteen years old and I have a sister...survivability in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I mean, you have to get to other levels of degradation before you take that option, although starting in '42 my father starts doing something very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Uh my father...and it has something to do with the squalid circumstances under which we live, although my mother made it, you know...it was quite presentable. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I mean I I didn't suffer. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We ate, you know, and the family life was very close. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Uh, certain things were in short supply, so what? </span><span class="sentence" id="171">But uh my father starts taking us out...there were certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> which, where we were permitted to go for hikes, certain <span class="REGION">areas</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="172">These were sometimes arbitrary restrictions. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">In other words, many of the laws as they came in...there was this <span class="BUILDING">bureaucratic factory</span> churning out new restrictive laws. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">They would...say..."What else can we do to these people?" </span><span class="sentence" id="175">You know, "What next tightening of the screw can we do to make them miserable?" </span><span class="sentence" id="176">But there was a whole <span class="REGION">region</span> , a whole <span class="REGION">area</span> where, which was really away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">provincial town</span> which was open, and so starting in '42, certainly in '43, my father takes us out for hikes, very long two-day hikes, and we spent lots of time in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">My father always liked the <span class="NPIP">outdoors</span> , but it also means we get away from the oppressive environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">When you get get out to the uh small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">peasant villages</span> out there the the, you know, it's different. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">The, the antisemitism 1s urban. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">It's connected with Jewish concentration where they have Jewish merchants and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> you don't have that. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">In addition to that, in these various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> were all of my father's little friends, so we could always stop in an <span class="BUILDING">inn</span> which was owned by a guy who most likely owed his life to my father, and certainly owed his livelihood to my father, and this was...my father was the kapo and these these were the soldiers out there, so we go out to these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and um clearly my father had this, you know, going out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> and surviving option on his mind because it was quite clear that if the Germans lose the war, and it was questionable in '42, uh, the front will come over and then the question is what do you do in the transition. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">You clearly have to get out of the urban environment where the fighting will take place. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So we get baptized in '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">I get bar mitzvah January 24, 1942, I get baptized in October. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">I'm very good at that by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I mean I mean the, the, the, uh, I mean this was very professionally done. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">I mean this was a proper baptism and the catechism and the whole thing and I'm very good at that. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">It turns that theologically the Lutheran religion appeals to me more than the Jewish religion because the Jewish religion is so obscure and so full of, you know, archaic rituals and the <span class="BUILDING">Lutheran Church</span> in, uh, in, uh, in <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> in in 1940's was very modern, forward looking, highly educated <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and that particular <span class="BUILDING">church</span> was a very small minority so when the Lutherans are a minority they are very nice people. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Because, you know, they live in this Catholic sea and uh, you know, then you suddenly can go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , any <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">They play Bach, and suddenly you can go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> on Sunday and it's perfectly legitimate. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">You're expected to. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">You know, you're baptized and the people are very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">Lutherans say, well, you know, it's it jolly, you know, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">You know, we got some Jews you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">Jesus Christ was a Jew and the Old Testament we read once in a while, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">The more the merrier, and besides Mr. Zeman who was the other priest who uh, uh, liked my father very well and they were quite close...they were really friends, you know, always saw to it that on the way out of the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> he stopped and talked to my father and talked to me and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And old Zeman really liked me because, you know, I knew the catechism as as good as any, you know...he used...once, once Zeman said a terrible thing which my father sort of laughed about. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Uh Zeman was teaching some kind of a theological discussion to a <span class="BUILDING">class</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">Sunday class</span> , and this kid just didn't know the answers, so Zeman say, "Well why don't you go and talk to Strassman. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">He'll explain it to you," and so the kid say, "Well, that's easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">He's a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">He knows it." (</span><span class="sentence" id="203">Laughter) You know, it was a reference to the Old Testament. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">My fath...father delighted in stories like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">So by end of '42, out of fourteen hundred Jews, uh we are down to about a hundred and fifty Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> , and the deportations come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">They are scheduled. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">There is this scurrying. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Uh in the morning the local gendarme knocks at your <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is on a <span class="DLF">siding</span> already scheduled. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">The whole thing is scheduled. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is, it's usually uh a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> but sometimes it's a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> , and uh and the gendarme comes and he gives you a piece of paper you have to sign. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Uh early they uh in the first set of deportations uh they actually come for the young people first because they go through the pretense that this is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> , so let's take the young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So the parents have to sign a receipt for their son and then they have to sign that they receive a receipt. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Procedure calls for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And so the thing is just denuded, and of course everybody is trying to scurry. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Everybody's trying to look for exemption but but...and everybody knows that there is a certain number of Jews who are not going to get to report although nobody knows how many. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">This is always kept open. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">And then there is a list and there are grades of protection. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">There is so-called a presidential exemption, and there is economic essential uh exemption. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Then there is an exemption for people who were government employees. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">In in other words there's grades of exemption. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Uh everybody spends a great deal of time trying to figure out what level of exemption they have. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> takes them...and people just go fairly uh fairly ... you know, you go and take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Uh there are rules. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">You can take only twenty kilos per person. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">Uh there's a big discussion ...well, what do you take? </span><span class="sentence" id="227">You know, do you take pots and pans, or don't you take pots and pans. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">Uh there 1s big discussion to the Judensrat, you know...uh give us a list of what to take. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Do we take pots and pans? </span><span class="sentence" id="230">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And and those kind of questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And the whole thing becomes involved in the minutia. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">The tragedies are not visible. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">There is not weeping or tearing. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">There is very little force. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">It is...you see you have now you have been through two years of being degraded more and more, so this is just another level of degradation, and by the way, you are going to _<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ilina</span> , which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">transhipment camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">A <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">staging camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And there are people who are able to get exemptions out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ilina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">In other words, you are shipped to _<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ilina</span> but that's not the final because you could still then protest and if you meet certain requirements you get an exemption to be pulled out of _<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ilina</span> , so so the energies are invested in trying to escape, and that fits very well with the mentality of survival which is centuries and centuries old and that the Jews survive by bending, accommodating and negotiating.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">QUESTION: How did your father survive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">ANSWER: My father just, uh, uh...first, he had money and he...all of that was gone by '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">He had friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">He had influence, and he was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">He was a very skillful man, and uh and he ran the biggest food business and oil business and petroleum business and fertilizer business, and all the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> were dependent, on him and there was enough people who said, you know, this guy is...and then he got the presidential exemption through Branecky, which was the highest level, so the word...well, you know, if any...you know, the last guy out out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> will be Strassman. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">The question was could he protect family. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">You see, very often the exemption stopped at the family head, and the children had to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And that's why we baptized because the this was there was this quirk is that if we baptize and he has number one exemption, then the thing falls in a different classification, so we baptized because of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">It was a terrible thing for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">She never got over that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION: Your parents were not baptized?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="252">ANSWER: Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Oh yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">They had to be baptized. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">That that was part of the procedure, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">You go and you look at the procedure and you study the procedure and you weigh the pros and cons. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">It, it creates a mentality which only a communist citizen or somebody who like Kafka would understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">It is a a twisted way of looking at the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And the Jewish mentality, of course, after centuries of experience, was especially well attuned to that because you negotiated your way out of <span class="COUNTRY">Spain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">You know, you became a Marrano. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">You baptized and all...I mean there's these innum...innumerable kind of deals that you can make, or you can reclassify yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Now you're not a Spaniard, you're a Portuguese. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">You're still in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , You give up the main <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION: Did the Strassman family live secretly as a Jew, as Jews while they were...after they had been baptized?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER: Turned out that my mother lived as a Jew, although there was no was no <span class="BUILDING">schul</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="267">There was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">There was no <span class="BUILDING">minyan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I mean the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">My wife...my mother was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">I mean that she always was, but I enjoyed the the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">I mean I could go and hear Bach for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">They let me play on the organ and and and, uh, the people were very nice, and the Lutherans also were part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sokol</span> [NB: translation, "Falcon"]. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">I don't know whether you know what it...it was a Turnverein. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">It's a gymnastic club, OK? </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And, uh, you know, you couldn't do other things so and I mean I couldn't go to the movie. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">I couldn't listen to this. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I couldn't listen to that, but apparently there was a loophole and nobody figured that a Jew would become a member of a Lutheran gymnastic club.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  What was that like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="280">ANSWER: Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">You know, I, I, I, you know, I, I accommodated. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Didn't wear a star after the presidential exemption. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Somebody who had a presidential exemption, he and his family did not have to wear a star. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And um, you know, everybody knew that I was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Uh, asa matter of fact, after the major deportation uh I think the bullies laid off me. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I mean they just...the bullies didn't go after me any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I mean most of my HaShomer HaTzair group was gone, uh with the exception of two and uh there was just not many things to pick on. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Now I got beaten up maybe once or twice a year, but that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I mean it was not just continual harassment. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">It was the, the, the yellow star that gave free license to the bullies to beat up everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Once you didn't have a yellow star...well, it confused them. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I mean it's, it's a, it's a very funny totalitarian society, is a very funny kind of society. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">You know, in many respects it lives by some very rigid rules.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION: What happened...tell us what happened next. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I'm sorry.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">ANSWER:  Well, this is '42. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">The deportations take place and now there is hundred and fifty Jews left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren</span> in. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">The Jews are living very low key, don't go out on the square. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">You know, you want to be as un...invisible as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">My father gets up early in the morning and he goes to the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">He's not in the <span class="BUILDING">front office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I mean it's his own <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , but he's in the <span class="BUILDING">back office</span> , you know, doing the paper work and the ordering and and the scheduling of things and who gets what, because you know, there's rationing and it becomes very complicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Uh, uh, I go to the appointed tutors. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I go to the <span class="BUILDING">gym</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">Uh, I go to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> on Sunday, which is enjoyable. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">My sister finds a job as a clerk. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">My mother is at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">The grandparents, one set of grandparents is protected...my father's...my grandfather from the father's side is protected because of my father's exemption. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Those are the only part of the family that can be protect...they don't go out at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">They just stay in this one <span class="DLF">room hovel</span> , and I bring them food. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">They don't go out shopping. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I mean they they are just invisible. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">And so starting in '42 except for the long hikes we take on weekends, we are invisible. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">It's a total shrinking in, and trying to listen to Radio London, uh, trying to find out what the news 1s, uh, having a map which you open every night and you see what happens on the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> and reading the newspapers to try to guess what really happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Uh, it's, it's a very...you know, you live in a two room apartment which includes a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and uh that goes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Uh, '43...I mean there is annoyances and uh but after the major bulk deportations, the Slovaks have done, you know, what the the uh Nazis wanted and the Slovaks have gotten all the properties they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">They divested anything, and uh they have Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sered</span> and in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaky</span> ...those are the two two remaining <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> uh where they have able-bodied men making <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> for the state, for the government, you know uh just being used as uh slave labor, but they are surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Uh my father has access to food, so we send lots of parcels, lots of people uh parcels. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">There are some illegals around, but they get flushed out and that goes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">That's '43 and early '44.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">QUESTION: What is your family's relationship now to the rest of the Jewish community? </span><span class="sentence" id="323">You've been baptized.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="341">ANSWER:  Early '44 things are starting to get interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">Of course, the front is starting to roll over. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">In early '44, uh, there's a huge quisling army in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Slovak state</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">In fact, there are two divisions, each of about forty thousand men. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">Uh, they get rotated in and out of the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Uh, originally when the Germans are winning, the quisling army fights with the Nazis, although they're never really given front duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">They do sort of second echelon kind of duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Uh, as soon as the Russians, after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stalingrad</span> and coming to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kharkov</span> , you suddenly start having defections from the Slovak army and you start creating a Czechoslovak Army in the Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">Of course there 1s a Czechoslovak army also in, in the west who escaped in '38 and '39. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">Uh, by early '44 the officer corps of the, uh, of the, uh, Czechoslovak army in, uh, in the west drops some officers down, and these are the officers with who, with whom they served prior to 1939 and they say look, we have to start getting ourself ready because the Germans are going to lose the war and so the officer corps uh decides that we are going to, uh, uh, attack the Germans when the time comes, when the...in order when the Russians come over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathian</span> rather than have destructive, hand-to-hand combat because everybody sees that when the front goes this way and that way through the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , there's nothing left...we are going to try to attack the Germans from the back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="351">QUESTION: What happens to you and your family as all this is happening?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  What I need to know...
ANSWER: We we are continue...we continue living, withdrawing more and more, although what loomed more and more importantly, and now we go out every weekend and now we start going out in February when it's cold and uh we start getting shoes, because the idea 1s that when the front will roll over we will leave where we are and go...disperse the family to the various people out there who are our loyalists, and we'll go and hide, because starting in '44 those Jews who remain, and there is about eight thousand Jews left over in all <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> , both legally and illegally and baptized, non-baptized, out of a population of, pre-war population of eighty-five thousand, so ten percent is left, which 1s still a very large number, although out of that eight thousand, a large proportion is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> uh, you know, doing slave labor, but they are...they did not go to <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">I would reckon that about two thousand out of the eight thousand are actually interned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , working uh at no wages for the Slovak government. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">Six thousand are dispersed for one reason or another, including, you know, uh, uh, women, Jewish women married to Christians and visa versa, mixed marriages and all kinds of exemptions and there was exemptions for American citizens and there was... mean there was a whole list of exemptions. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">OK?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="360">ANSWER: And and our family just lived in that environment and starting in '44, everybody starts saying OK, now now uh when the war comes in, how do we survive, because everybody knows that uh when the front comes over uh the Germans are going to come in and then all the bets are off. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">In other words, all of the exemptions under which you live are going to be thrown out, because then uh you have a different law. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">You also must understand that the quisling government found it very convenient and so did the Germans uh to sort of have their own order because that gives them jobs, nationalistic and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And of course the Nazis had other fish to fry and as long as the quislings controlled things...OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">So you want to keep your eight thousand Jews or out ofthem __.._ I'm going to worry about other things, you know, like the Hungarian Jews and the Romanian Jews and and the destruction of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Meanwhile I'm gassing the Jews, so I'm going to get to your Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And there are documents to that effect, and so starting in early '44, the family starts becoming concerned about how to survive the transition and this is when these very bizarre plots get hatched, and everybody does them very secretly on their own. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Uh some people are going to go what's called into a <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">A <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> is some kind of a dug-out. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">You know, the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> are strung with <span class="INT_SPACE">cellars</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">root cellars</span> where you keep your carrots and your cabbages. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">I mean there's no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span> but you go below the <span class="DLF">frost line</span> , you have sand in there and it's a mound of earth, a <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="372">You creep in and you're going to stay there until liberation comes and you...uh the man who uh who uh married my wife...uh my my my sister, my sister, Ella, my older sister ... she's five years older than me...uh hatches this totally unlikely plot that he has a friend and this friend is a bricklayer. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">This bricklayer finds in that old <span class="BUILDING">house</span> a <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> where he's going to make a false <span class="DLF">brick wall</span> and my brother-in-law, uh Gejza uh 1s going to go and you know, when when when the quisling's government goes down and the Nazis come in, they all set it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">They set out bricks and mortar and all what he will do. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">On a night's notice he will able to go to this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , un crawl in at the end of the <span class="INT_SPACE">corridor</span> , and this bricklayer is going to make a false <span class="DLF">wall</span> , uh three feet on this side and Gejza going to be there, and there are going to be three false bricks to bring food 1n once day and take the excrements out and he's going to stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And by the way, that's what actually happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">The guy was behind that <span class="DLF">wall</span> for eleven months. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">OK? </span><span class="sentence" id="379">And so every Jew then tries to concoct this this what's called the transition plot, OK, and some people have better plots. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Some people have bad plots. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">Some people don't have plots. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Some people believe in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> we can muddle through. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">Some people say, "no, nothing is going to happen and it's just going to...suddenly we're going to be liberated." </span><span class="sentence" id="384">It's called the liberation scenario. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">So starting in '44, the liberation scenario becomes very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">At this particular time my father said, "Well we are going to take the option of dispersing the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">We're not going to be together. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">You're going to go here. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">You're going to go here...we go to here..." and these things...these are nego...these deals are negotiated. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">So that's what's early '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Meanwhile the plots are being hatched and there is news that uh parachutists are dropping uh during the night, and you know, getting ready for the transition and so forth, because everybody is getting ready for for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to collapse any moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">Now this 1s early '44, again. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">Am I answering your...
QUESTION: You are indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">At this point I want to stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">Let us change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION TAPE #2 TECHNICAL CONVERSATION
QUESTION: Early '44?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="397">ANSWER: Early '44 the quisling army, the two divisions that fight for the for the, uh, Slovak quisling government, uh, makes a deal with the London government [NB: the Czechoslovak government in exile] and the idea is that when the time comes to, uh, for the Russians to cross over the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathian mountains</span> , uh, that government will come in, the Slovak army will attack the Germans in the mountain passes from the rear, hold ground until the army can come over and uh that's how it would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">We will liberate <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Uh, the deal is made, uh, in May, but that's when the news comes out what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .! </span><span class="sentence" id="400">As you know...again 1t was a western inspired, western led uprising that uh led to the Russians stopping at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Visla</span> [NB: <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> ], and letting the Germans wipe them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">So another meeting takes place and the idea now is to make a deal with the communists, who also have an army running under the Soviet command from the east, and say we are going to make this join and in order to cooperate with the with the uh Soviets we are going to put the communists in charge and so late in May a meeting is held where the communists are going to go <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kiev</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> of the uh Russian army is headed by a man by the name of Krushchev, Nikita Krushchev [NB: at this time, acting as Commissar of the Soviet partisans], and the timing of the Russian attacking is the <span class="DLF">mountain pass</span> and the communist leadership now of the Slovak underground will be coordinated so we don't have a situation like in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Turns out the communists don't keep their part of the deal. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">They actually never communicate with the Soviets. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">The communists were totally ' The Warsaw Revolt began in early August 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">different scenario and in fact they want to repeat the same thing that happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and so the communists rather than wait for a coordinated army and underground and communists and Russian attack across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , jump in guerrilla saboteurs early in August in large quantity into <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and these saboteurs without any coordination with anybody, stopped the night train that goes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bucharest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">Just happens on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> are twenty-eight German generals. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Line them up on the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ru_omberok</span> and shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">The following day uh my father says "OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">This is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">We are going to go into our escape plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">We are going to execute our escape plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">We are going to disperse," and so that morning which is the 28th of uh 27th of August, 1944, uh we go and we get dropped off in the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and we stay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Well it turns out that the Germans are a little slow to react. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">They take some retaliatory action which is local but there is no Sonderkommando, not anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">And also the uh the base which 1s the business, it still has to be run and so after two days in our <span class="NPIP">locations</span> , uh my uh my father is told uh look, you better come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">This 1s...you jumped the gun a little. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">You...it's premature. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So the whole family retrieves from the pre-staged <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> and we go back where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">Now this 1s a fatal mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">But it leads...it's it's part of really not understanding what was really going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">Uh and because of course the Russians are not crossing the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathians</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">The Russians have no intentions of crossing. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">They just start a new offensive in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , so <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> is not even on the map of of being crossed. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">What the Germans meanwhile do is they just land Sonderkommandos for the sole purpose of disarming the Slovak army, the various Slovak, uh, uh, Slovak, uh, garrisons. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">They successfully disarmed the eastern division, which was the highly armed, which was the spear-head of this whole plot. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">They totally disarmed them and they shoot the, uh, the, uh, the key generals who staged it... who were going to stage that thing because all of this thing is leaked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">The western division, which is about thirty-five thousand men, um, just escape the garrisons before the Germans can get there to disarm them. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">The, the soldiers mutiny and just take to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , and that happens late on the 29th of August. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">At this particular point, the Germans come over and then the fighting starts between the the, uh, Slovak soldiers of the <span class="REGION">western division</span> and the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Uh, on the night of the 29th of August, uh, for reasons which I still don't understand, my father decided, "Why don't you sleep <span class="BUILDING">home</span> tonight and just why, why don't you go and sleep somewhere else so that the whole family's not together," although we are still in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And I go to sleep at a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of a friend, uh, who was half-Jewish and they were workers and, and, and somehow...nobody every paid attention to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">I just slept there. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Early in the morning I get the message during the night the Gestapo came and took twelve hostages, and my father was one of the hostages. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">They were...he was not taken as a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">He was taken as the head operator. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">Subsequently in '45, I find out that my father was involved in shipping food, uh, into illegal food caches that were being already staged starting in May, so that when the army starts holding against the Germans there is food already in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> being staged for the for the uh for the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">So in the morning uh my father gets taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">They were looking for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">All the males were going to be taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">I wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">They just came in...they came in during the night. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Again this was totally irregular. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Whenever Jews were taken, you know, the local gendarmerie came with the bureaucratic procedure, and there was a time to be warned. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">The Germans...there was no warning. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">They just took, uh, uh, some some people who are involved, uh, in in the uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">They were taken as hostages, and so now, uh, the message comes for my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">You know, I never see my mother again. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">Uh, we cannot go back to where we were before. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">We blew our cover. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">We go to a fallback position. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">In other words, there were two layers of <span class="NPIP">places</span> to go to and so I leave the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where I was sleeping, with this friend, and go to an employee of my father who was in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> outside of of of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren</span> in. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">My sister goes to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="454">My mother goes to another <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">So the family gets dispersed. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">We go into what's called bunker mode, which is you go somewhere and you're going to be hidden somewhere in a <span class="INT_SPACE">closet</span> or something until the war blows over, but my father isn't there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">My father gets taken. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">Uh he gets tortured and he gets shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> where he's killed, but he gets shipped with the uh uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Uh there's a whole group of people involved in the uprising who who gets uh who gets annihilated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So I go over to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of this this fallback, second position uh backup. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And I'm there one night. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">In the morning the wife of this employee comes in all panicky. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">This employee had a young wife, recently married. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">He was a much older man. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">This was his second marriage. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">The girl was sort of a floozy or whatever and uh she comes in all alarmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">She's a new wife, and says, "Look...the Germans are doing <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to house search," and by that time the Germans announced that "If we find any uh partisans, soldiers or Jews uh we are going to shoot them and also shoot every inhabitant in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="469">So the wife gets very alarmed and this newly married older guy goes to me and says, "Look, why don't you just go away for the day out to the to the to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> where there are thrushes and bushes...you know, it's it's fairly wooded and near the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="470">Throughout the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> flows a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> by the name of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vah</span> and there are all kinds of <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="471">Why don't you stay there? </span><span class="sentence" id="472">And uh then come back in the evening and we'll see how things go." </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Now remember...I'm fifteen years old, so I...and oh...and I get a sandwich. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">I go in my sandals, in my short shoes, a shirt a belt and a sandwich, for the day at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Now you also must understand that through all of this time I know the <span class="REGION">area</span> extremely well, and I'm a fabulous swimmer because we swim quite a bit in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">It's a wild <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">It has it has it has uh <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rapids</span> too, and we swim through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">rapids</span> and so forth, but you know...and it's it's part of the training and oh...we swim through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> because we couldn't go to the only <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> there was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Since 1940 Jews are not allowed to go to the <span class="DLF">swimming pool</span> so you learn how to swim through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , which is dangerous and full of rapids, but it's fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">I told you, you know, hardship creates fun too. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">So I go to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and I sit there and during the day I see on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> coming in and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> and the Germans are really moving in. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">Now the Germans are coming in full force. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">The army has basically abandoned the <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">There is a huge <span class="BUILDING">garrison</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren</span> in. </span><span class="sentence" id="485"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren</span> in is ais a <span class="BUILDING">regiment headquarters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">It's it's a strategic <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">Always has been. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">It is...by the way, it is a strategic <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> since Roman times, so it's one of the old, old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Roman camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="489">It's it's a throttle of the of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> , and there I see the Germans going up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">By about three o'clock in the afternoon I hear lots of shooting out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , which 1s in the direction which I knew very well which we...because we hiked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">And by four o'clock in the afternoon I decided I'm not going to go back to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> of this employee where his wife is not sure that really she she likes me and and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">It it's purely an instinct. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">It's it's...J don't know...you you learn it as an animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">There are certain survival uh instincts that you have and I say I will not be able to last there a couple of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I mean you are fifteen years old but you can...you know now how to make calculations. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">And I say well, they are shooting so that means that that's good news, because you know, if they're shooting there that means that there are some friends out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So about four o'clock in the afternoon I uh take off my shirt, take the sandals, tie them up on my head with my belt, and I go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and I swim down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , under the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> where the Nazis go up and down, and I swim for about five kilometers, totally out of range of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , get out, know the <span class="REGION">area</span> extremely well...we hiked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">It's a very picturesque <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">It's it's it's a it's a valley surrounded by <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> on both sides, highly wooded, and I start marching late in the evening through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and and if you know that <span class="REGION">area</span> these are small land-holdings and there are little <span class="DLF">paths</span> , there are just millions of little <span class="DLF">paths</span> between each <span class="REGION">property</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">This...these are not big <span class="DLF">fields</span> and and there are there are <span class="DLF">tree lines</span> and there are bushes so there is always a place to hide and I walk in my shorts in this thing and and again my not being sort of alienated, not being an urban Jew, I just walked through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> and the, you know, the the peasants see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">You know, you say uh the right thing...you...there is, there is a way...you know, bless the God and you know, the answer...bless the Mary and you know you...there there are greetings because the peasants are really very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">These are small semi-feudal kind of enclaves, uh but you can walk free right though those <span class="REGION">enclaves</span> and I get up to the <span class="DLF">mountain line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="503">There is lots of shooting going on there, and I run into a bunch of soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">These are who from the <span class="BUILDING">Tren_in garrison</span> , and they are resting there with a machine gun and and rifles and what have you, and uh I say, "You know, I would like to join you." </span><span class="sentence" id="505">So the sergeant says, "You are a Jew aren't you?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="506">Yah, I am a Jew." </span><span class="sentence" id="507">He says, "Well, we...you know, you are just a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">We don't...we are out for serious business on the...we are going to be fighting the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Uh we can't have somebody...you have never shot a rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">We don't need you." </span><span class="sentence" id="511">I said, you know, "But look, I I really need help." </span><span class="sentence" id="512">So they said, "Look, kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">Here is a hand grenade. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">We'll give you a hand grenade but just go away." </span><span class="sentence" id="515">So I say, "Well, what do you do with a hand grenade?" </span><span class="sentence" id="516">So the guy shows me how to unlatch a hand grenade, close the hand grenade, and puts me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">So I wander through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> (cough) for about a day with a hand grenade. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">I stop at...there is a <span class="BUILDING">hunting lodge</span> up there and I go to the uh keeper of the <span class="BUILDING">hunting lodge</span> and I said, you know, I would like some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">He gives me plenty of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">Of course, I carry the hand grenade. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I'm quickly learning the trick how you get food. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">And so I wander around and then on the second or third day...I don't know which anymore...and of course I sleep out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I know how to do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">Although I've no clothing, there is a way of taking pine branches and sleeping out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">You you really can do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">I mean if if you...it's not that difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And there are lots of hay rakes, all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , so you can always take some straw out of a hay rake, make a bedding out of uh pine and then put straw on it and then cover yourself with straw...you can be very comfortable, and if it rains you go into a hay rake. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">There's all kinds of shooting going on all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but it's very spotty. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">On this morning of the third day I suddenly see a tall figure coming up the <span class="DLF">path</span> with obviously a heavy gun or something and I hide behind a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> , unlatch my hand grenade and when the guy passes me I just stick my hand with the hand grenade behind his back and said, "Give me your gun." </span><span class="sentence" id="530">The guy turns around and it is a officer who is in civilian clothing who is taking a heavy machine gun over. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">He's going to join the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">He's looking for the partisans the way I am looking for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">So he said, "Kid, do you know what you're doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="534">I mean are sure you know how to put the pin back?" </span><span class="sentence" id="535">So uh, you know, after he identifies himself I finally put the pin back and say, "Well, you and I are going to go and look for the partisans together," so we walk for about a half a day, and then we come in at the bottom of the <span class="DLF">mountain range</span> and there we see at the...from the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> on the <span class="DLF">road</span> a bunch of guys... obviously not soldiers, funny looking guys, running around and there is a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> there, and so uh Kartal, the the officer, said, "You know, I'm going to cover you with the machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Why don't you go down there and find out what those guys are...are they our side or what are they." </span><span class="sentence" id="537">See meanwhile of course the guards and the quislings also had uh civil guards and battalions and all kinds of arms things...I mean this was all mished, messed up, so I put my hand grenade and walked down, and there 1s this funny looking little squat guy and, uh, his only right hand and his left hand is chopped off and, uh, he carries Soviet stars on his on his epaulets. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And, uh, it turns out to be one of these special commando groups that were dropped by the Soviets two weeks before, and these are really professional killers. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">These are real guerrillas. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">This is...these are people who have been through the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> in a guerrilla warfare for two, three years, and they are collecting apparently squat. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">They just came from scouting around looking for the <span class="DLF">rail line</span> and when they came, the <span class="DLF">rail line</span> was too far away so I...they start immediately quizzing me and I say, well, I have a partner up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">They see a heavy machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">They say, "Well, we like you guys," so they immediately take the officer with the heavy machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">They need a heavy machine gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Uh, they they say, "Well, what do we do with you kid?" </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And I say, "Well, you know, I really know this <span class="REGION">area</span> very well," so the uh the Russian who's...you know, "you can really understand Russian reasonable well." </span><span class="sentence" id="547">This was the Ukrainian uh said, "you know, we really could use somebody who knows the <span class="REGION">local area</span> to walk ahead of us and, you know, we'll dress you up in some ragged peasant stuff and you will just...we'll we'll use you as a as a guide to walk ahead of us, and if you want to keep the hand grenade you can keep the hand grenade as long as you don't show it, and then you can always blow yourself up if they catch you." (</span><span class="sentence" id="548">Laughter) So, so, uh, I, I think this is a great...I think...I thought this was a fantastic deal, and so uh they logged me in and they signed me up right away, you know...we are put you in and uh then let's hop in the hop in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="549">We mount the machine gun on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> in case we run into Germans or Gardists...these were called like guardists, like they were called "Garda." </span><span class="sentence" id="550">We go in into a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where apparently there is a base being made and there 1s...1t's full of soldiers and there's arms all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> and there's dynamite all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="551">I mean there was just just all the arms you wanted to see because the soldiers...this was...they vacated the <span class="BUILDING">garrisons</span> , took all the arms and they all and all all the ammo with them and I say well could I at least have a rifle, so we go this through this long negotiation. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">Youcan have a rifle. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">And uh I sleep, get fed pork. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I really feel fantastic. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">I mean...I'm, I'm really...I mean this is a bunch of he-men. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">I'm clearly the youngest guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">Uh early in the afternoon somebody says well, do you know how to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">I say I don't even know how to load the thing, so they take me out and they say this is what you do and they show me how to how to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">In the morning uh this, this, this Russian comes. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">His name is "Batko" ...everybody's only known by their first name...comes and say, "Well, we're going to go for a raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Uh we really have to find a <span class="DLF">rail line</span> that is close to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> so we can really get ourselves lined up in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Uh we're taking you with us kid." </span><span class="sentence" id="564">So I go...but no rifle...peasant clothing, just the hand grenade in your pocket, so I go on the first raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">Now turns out that this was the luckiest thing that ever happened to me, because the army that fled and the communist government that got created, created actually an <span class="REGION">area</span> , a liberated area. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">They declared it a Czechoslovak-liberated state. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">It was a hundred by two hundred kilometers. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">They decided to hold it until the Russians come. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">Now this was in September. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">This was another Warsaw Uprising, only on a much bigger scale and uh "Batko''s orders was never stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="571">Never stay put. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">Your job is not to fight Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">Your job 1s to mess railroad, <span class="DLF">rail lines</span> up. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Now I didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">Now one of the grave misfortunes of the other Jews were that they came in...this was a liberated area. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">They joined the established environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">Many of the Jews who had fled to that <span class="REGION">area</span> , and of course when the Germans cleaned it up by October 28th, everybody got annihilated and there are these hugh <span class="DLF">tank ditches</span> that people dug which are full of bodies. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">You know, about eighty-five thousand people got killed in that that process. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">So we go on the first raid I think on the 4th of September, and uh I like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">I mean it is just great. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">You know, here are the guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">You know, there's eight of us, a machine gun, uh lots of ammo. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">Uh there are guys who are carrying the TNT...that's what we used, uh TNT. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">It's it's it's more powerful than than than dynamite but it's not like plastique, and these are little uh metal boxes about this big, this wide and uh it's a real charming group. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">Uh a commando squad is a very unusual dynamics. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">In other words, in no time everybody knows he is dependent on everybody, so I mean nobody says "I'm a Jew," or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I mean it's just, you know, "Hey, kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">You know, you going to walk ahead of us, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">We we really need you." </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And so I lead them through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> and uh we go further north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren</span> in. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">See, below <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">valley</span> widens and the <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> hugs the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> so it's about two, three kilometers away from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="592">Once you go north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tren_in</span> , you are in a narrow valley and the <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> sort of snakes in and out and there are dozens of <span class="NPIP">places</span> where you can come fairly close to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> without being seen. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">So I take them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">They are very pleased uh with with that, and uh so we march during the day, ducking the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="595">Of course the peasants see us, but everybody turns around. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">You know, they don't want to see us and uh we go...starts raining. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">We come to the edge, edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> early in the evening and we are just going to sit there and wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">I I'm not sure I know what's going on, but "Batko" obviously knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">He must have done it dozens and dozens of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">He sets up the machine gun so that if if uh the troops would come against us...the idea is to have a high ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> is down, and we find, as I will show you later on a photograph, it's an <span class="DLF">embankment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">We sit at the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="603">There is an <span class="DLF">embankment</span> below us where we sit will sit up the machine gun and then uh then a few of us will go to the <span class="DLF">track</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Uh as soon as it gets dark uh "Batko" uh says "OK, let's go to the <span class="DLF">track</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And why don't you come with us." </span><span class="sentence" id="606">So three of us go down to the <span class="DLF">track</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Why he took me, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">We go to the <span class="DLF">track</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="609">We lay the TNTs right on to the rail. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And the the the trick is in demolition...this 1s not what you see in movies, John Wayne movies...there is no way how you can carry enough ammo to blow up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> sky high. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">To blow up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> sky high you would have to be on a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">You would have to know exactly where the bridge pins are. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">The <span class="DLF">bridges</span> were usually in populated areas. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">There was no way; and they were guarded and it was too risky. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">The real trick is to get the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> derail itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">The way how you do it is you find a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="DLF">track</span> is slightly on a curve. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">The way a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> runs 1s that the it has flanges, sort of...1n other words, the way, the reason a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> doesn't derail is because the wheels are open on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> but if pieces of steel going down so that the piece of steel always presses against the lip of the rail and the trick then is to blow up the heaviest part of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , which is the tender. </span><span class="sentence" id="618">In other words, the steam...these are <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">steam locomotives</span> by the ways...the heaviest part of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is where you have the water and the coal, which 1s usually about fifteen meters behind the front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="619">I mean, these are standard-sized <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">locomotives</span> and the way "Batko" explains it all you have to do is knock out the rail under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tender</span> , the heavy part, and derail the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tender</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="620">The tender will tip over and pull the rest of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> down from the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="621">So you know, this is an art form. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">So far as "Batko" is concerned, derailing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> is an art form. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">The...and then he, of course, he is full of stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">You know, as we sit there he tells me stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">He is a very lively kind of a guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Uh again, the squad is eight people, three Russians and five Slovaks of whom four are communists (including one of them who fought in the Spanish civil war), so that's that's the squad and the guy who fought in the Spanish Civil War, it's it's a father and a son so there's father and son in the squad. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">That's that's the makeup of the squad. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">Get along very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">And uh the idea then is to lay the TNT under the rail, connect a fuse so that when the first wheel of the steam engine comes and crushes the fuse it will ignite the detonator. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">OK? </span><span class="sentence" id="631">And the detonator then will ignite a cord and the cord goes at the rate of one second every twenty centimeters, so that the speed of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is about forty miles an hour, thirty miles an hour, you need a cord approximately four feet long so that when the first wheel detonates the thing, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> will have passed approximately fifteen meters and it will blow right under the wheel of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tender</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="632">Again this is this is...now we're doing with professionals. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">The problem with most of the partisans that existed and the stories that you hear about partisans...these were all amateurs. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">This is this is this is killer stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">Highly specialized. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So uh we lay the TNT. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">We lay the fuse, but we don't put the fuse on top of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail</span> , because we are going to do it only when we get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">We don't want to blow up a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="639">Uh and so that's how we do it for the first time. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">Uh we know by sound how this thing works. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Uh we can tell a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> . "</span><span class="sentence" id="642">Batko" knows how to tell a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="643">We go back to the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> about midnight, maybe eleven o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">I don't remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">By that time it rains. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">The <span class="DLF">field</span> that is between the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> ...you know, it's only about two hundred meters but it's a it's a soggy field and uh between the <span class="DLF">field</span> there is a <span class="DLF">path</span> which is beaten but everything else has been plowed. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">I mean this is September. </span><span class="sentence" id="648">This is a <span class="DLF">wheat field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">It has been plowed, and "Batko" says, "You just make sure that you're in there where the <span class="DLF">path</span> is." </span><span class="sentence" id="650">So we go back up. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">When the uh when when "Batko" says, "I've seen we've got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> ," and we go back up on the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> and we crouch against the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> and we wait until we see the lights of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="652">You have to see the lights of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freight train</span> because if the Germans have what's called a draisienne [NB: a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">handcar</span> ], which 1s a little <span class="DLF">platform</span> or a a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">armored car</span> ahead of it...they usually used to push a flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> ...later by the way they had hostages on the on the flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with them from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">local villages</span> but this time they didn't...you want to make sure they don't blow up the uh flat <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And of course this was still early, and I don't think on the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> the Germans expected anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">You know, they used a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">rail car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="655">This is the main <span class="DLF">rail line</span> between <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">This is the <span class="DLF">train line</span> from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> to _<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ilina</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Katowice</span> , and the Germans did not know whether the Russians are going to attack through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Danube Valley</span> or through the Vis _a[NB: <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula] Valley</span> , so those three <span class="DLF">lines</span> that were going north-south were critical to the ability of the Germans to shift troops back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">They were running out of troops, out of out of troops and out of uh the ability to defend, so those three <span class="DLF">lines</span> were very dependent. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">The Ukrainian command had four squads who had nothing else to do except keep those <span class="DLF">lines</span> , <span class="DLF">lines</span> harassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">And by the way, when you blow up that <span class="DLF">line</span> , usually it gets cleared up in about a half a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">The the objective...Yah, I mean you cannot disable the <span class="DLF">line</span> unless you blow up a bri...a major <span class="DLF">bridge</span> which you couldn't do. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">I mean the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> were extremely well defended. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">That's the first thing the Germans took care of. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">All you can do is make it difficult for the Germans, make them go slow, uh divert arms, go into com... and and deploy troops to keep the <span class="DLF">lines</span> clear so you you really...it's a harassing act. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">It's it's it's it's it's a bee bite. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">It's not deadly stuff, but that's what guerrilla warfare is all about. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">So so uh we have to wait until we see the lights of the of the uh of the of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and as we go back to arm this thing, uh "Batko," who is going to do that, hands over to me the detonators. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">It's a box. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">The the the detonators are in a box. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">It's it's a sort of leather pouch. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">These are little cartridges about this big. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">It has uh fulminate of mercury. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">If you hit it, 1t explodes. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">It's...these are the igniters that you have in all ammunition. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">And while he's fitting the fuse he holds, asks me to hold uh that leather box which 1s lined with cotton and has these detonators. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Now what I didn't know was that we had more TNT than we had detonators. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">We were short in detonators. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And so this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> keeps coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">You see the lights and there is "Batko," you know, uh mounting this detonator on that fuse and I'm pretty cool and uh as I hand it to him I spill all the detonators right on the uh <span class="DLF">embankment</span> , which is made out of gravel and "Batko" says, "You better get those." </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I mean...and and this this is serious stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">So...and he starts running off the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> is coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">I stand there on the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> , pick up the detonators, put them in my pocket, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">And when I picked up all the detona....by that time I have light from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="683">I just start running down the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> and I miss the, it's called the "medza"...the the little space between <span class="DLF">fields</span> where you can walk is called a "medza." </span><span class="sentence" id="684">And uh I miss it, so I hit the plowed wet <span class="DLF">field</span> , which is really a potfull of mud and I just uh go, you know, maybe uh twenty feet or something and then I see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> sort of chugging and I look over my shoulder and I say, "Well, this is just about when it's going to blow." </span><span class="sentence" id="685">I hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> blows. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">And you could see the front end of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and the engine slowly....it's like slow motion...it sort of...1t's it's funny, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">I could see it like today. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">It just blows and then slowly starts going off the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> and then pulls the front <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">The front <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> had some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">I mean it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">troop train</span> , and in the middle was...the Germans had uh uh you know machine gun nests and you hear, pop...it's there what you call flares, and the way a flare works, a flare gun...it's a big barrel gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">It's a rocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">You hear the pop. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">It's like on Fourth of July. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">You always hear the ignition and the take-off and it only ignites when it gets up on the top. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">So I stay on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">You know, I I hear, I feel the hot stuff uh from the from the steam escaping from the from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and the iron's flying around but didn't hit me, and there I see a white light coming down. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">They've shot it over very far, and of course "Batko" by that time was scrambling up the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> and so they started shooting at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">Didn't hit him. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">So as soon as the flare dies out, I start running down the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">Now maybe the Germans had only one flare gun, or maybe the guy who's shooting the flare gun was very slow, but the the uh you know there were intervals, enough intervals between the uh flare guns that I could always...when I hear a pop I hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and waited, and of course they were raking with machine gun fire with tracers over the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">They didn't know what they were shooting at. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">Uh they didn't see that there was an <span class="DLF">embankment</span> actually going up. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">They were just sort of raking at eye level. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">And I made it up the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">You know, it's it's...you will see from the picture...it's it's not a big distance but it's an interminable distance under fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And uh uh our guys didn't shoot back. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">It it...our guys were going to shoot back only, because then you reveal your fire and then you draw fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">You only shoot when you see the troops dismounting and pursuing. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Yeah, you only shoot against... mean these were professionals. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">I mean amateurs would have popped their guns, you know, started shooting willy nilly and then the Germans would have shooted willy nilly, and but these were really professionals, particularly the guy from the Spanish civil war. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">This was a cool cucumber. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I mean this guy was an absolute professional killer. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">Uh by the way, this guy after the war became the uh head of a trial. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">He was the head judge that hanged Tiso. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">He was the...he became a judge. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">This this one judge you wouldn't want to come in front of. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">At any rate, a great guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">So I get up the <span class="DLF">embankment</span> and they were lying down there. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">They were waiting for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">One one of the things in a commando squad is, in a professional commando squad, you don't let your guys hang around. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Now if they get wounded, you shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">Because you don't want them to fall into enemy hands, but but there's a funny ethic in a in that kind of attack, that that you really protect your people. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">You don't have that many and so they said OK, you made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Did OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">So then we go up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and and uh we uh we stop and uh at a little <span class="DLF">clearing</span> and of course we hear the crackle from there and the Germans are firing firing wildly but it's dark, it's raining, so you know, the the bullets are not even coming close to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And uh "Batko" says "OK, now let's regroup." </span><span class="sentence" id="728">He pulls out his pistol and points it at me..." You lost our caps. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">We cannot go on another raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">You lost my caps. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">That's punish...punishable. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">You know, we're going to shoot you, you Jew kid!" </span><span class="sentence" id="733">you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And I said, "Well, what do you mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I got them." </span><span class="sentence" id="736">And I go in my pocket and I pulled the detonators out of my pocket and everybody sort of goes to the side (laughter). "</span><span class="sentence" id="737">This kid"...I mean, "how did you make it because you know, if you would have hit it...I mean if you hit it like that, you would have blown" ...apparently I was totally oblivious to it but the mud was so soft that whenever I hit the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> ...I mean it would have tore off my leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">So this "Batko" says, "Boy, are you lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">You are so lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">We we're going to put you right into the squad. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">We need a little luck," so so I became as a result of that uh the member of the squad and uh then they took me back and they trained me how to do it, and uh then I did a number of raids with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">Uh "Batko" was sort of a braggart. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">I mean he was a real braggart and one day we were just mov...coming back from a raid and we were very tired. "</span><span class="sentence" id="744">Batko" says, "I'm not going to slug through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> ," because we used to go off the <span class="DLF">paths</span> and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">This was al... already in October. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Things were getting pretty tough and the German patrols were all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and he said, "We are we are just going to go on the <span class="DLF">road</span> ," and we said, you know, "You can't do that." "</span><span class="sentence" id="747">Oh, we're going to go down the <span class="DLF">road</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="748">So we say, "Well, we're going going to walk in the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> ," because I mean to walk in the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> during the day it was, it was insane. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">He says, "I'm just too tired to to slug through the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Again, 1t was raining and sloshing and what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">So we walked down the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and suddenly a German patrol came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">They had a machine gun and this crazy "Batko" stood in the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> with his uh PTS, which is this this Russian uh automatic with the seventeen...it looks like gangster...it's a knock-off of a Al Capone gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And he stands in the middle of the <span class="DLF">road</span> and the...you know...that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol truck</span> with a machine gun on top, stands there and shoots...stands...he doesn't, didn't budge. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">You know, we were in the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And he just stands and they just cut him down. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">He was going to get that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">So we lost him, and after that the squad just didn't have luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">I mean, we just...the other two Russians were not very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Uh, I, I don't know why, but, but, but just the luck ran out of it and then, uh, on November 2nd, uh, we had the misfortune to get mixed up in a fight that we really didn't belong to. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Uh, the Germans always tried to move the partisans that were remaining. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">By, you know, by the 28th they cleaned up the fixed position, they destroyed the army, the soldiers were fighting with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">The Jews...there was a two hundred-man Jewish brigade from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novaky</span> who was given on open <span class="DLF">field</span> the job of holding the <span class="DLF">line</span> for retreating soldiers ... against advancing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="763">I mean total slaughter, and then the Germans had Ukrainians Sonderkommandos, not German, to go after the remainder of the troops...uh you know, just driving us up into little <span class="REGION">enclaves</span> , surrounding us and then just wiping us out because these were extremely skilled anti-guerrilla uh operations. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">I mean these were professional operations for uh getting rid of guerrillas. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">I mean there's there's are whole ways how you go after guerrillas. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">And uh I think that the the two Russians sort of wanted to to to sort of keep with others because of food or whatever and so in November we got uh we joined a bigger group because we were going to move our base and we got caught, surrounded on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I mean there was snow by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">It was snowing by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">You know, it was like a foot of snow and uh they drove us on a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> which had the...was surrounded on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> with the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , on the other side with a with a <span class="DLF">road</span> and uh they were just firing uh uh shrapnel all day into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="770">We were taking heavy, heavy casualties. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">You see, in those days when you took a...when you were wounded, you were...you might as well shoot yourself and so uh they were shooting at us all day and then during the night they went after us, which was very unusual, and the way they went after us, they pretended that they were Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">These were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vlasov</span> ...these were the Vlasov guys, and so I got separated in November from the, from the squad. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">That night uh I and another guy from the squad, who by the way was acriminal. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">You know, the the makeup of of this group was...got more and more unsavory as time went on, and as we were on the ridge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and we just rolled down the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and uh we crossed the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">Now this was November...iced <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , all slippery, in snow, and we waded the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and uh we escaped the the uh surrounding, but everybody else was involved got either captured, or shot, or killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">Uh I think there must have been something like two hundred partisans on that <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="777">I think only about twenty, thirty got away, and uh soaking wet uh we started marching east. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">By that time we decided we are going to just move towards the front, and uh then I joined another brigade and then starting in December we started slowly fighting our way east. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">I only went on one more raid in January, and by that time I had pleurisy and I was bleeding and...I was...after February I didn't fight anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">I mean just could hardly walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Uh I crossed the <span class="DLF">lines</span> about uh four hundred kilometers east of where I joined the partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">In other words, we started walking towards the <span class="REGION">Russian front</span> , and we finally crossed the <span class="DLF">line</span> on March 25th, 1944 [NB: This must be 1945, since he joined the partisans in Sept. 1944], so I joined the partisans on the 4th of September and joined the Czechoslovak army...it turned out when we crossed the front we ran into the Czechoslovak brigade. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">It was coming out of Soviet Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">Uh the Russians immediately got separated from us because they were all suspect of being collaborators, using the partisans purely as being a cover for them and there was quite a bit of that so they...all the Russians immediately the moment we crossed the front immediately went for interrogation by the NK VD. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Uh early in uh March we also picked up five Americans fliers who were wandering through the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> who uh who had been shot down and who who just stayed with the partisans, although they refused...this was a very peculiar thing...they refused to carry arms because they were protected by the Geneva Convention if they didn't carry arms and you know, we told them..."Look, you guys,...I1 mean I mean, you're not going to enter a long debate with, with, with the Sonderkommando when they catch you." </span><span class="sentence" id="787">No, they didn't want to carry arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Uh we also picked up an agent from the British ISA uh OSS. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">The misfortune of that guy was that apparently he was carrying quite a bit of cash and gold on him. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">He was dropped that way and uh the Russians accused him of being a spy and they shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">I mean there's some really ghastly stories I could tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">I mean pretty ghastly stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">But I didn't get wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">I was just just totally, you know, physically and mentally worn out and had abscesses and sores all over the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I mean a real sorry state. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I think I must have weighed, and lost, less than a hundred pounds when I crossed the <span class="DLF">lines</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I got immediately picked up uh by the Czechoslovaks and they shipped me to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and I stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> during the month of April. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">Uh I had all the food...I mean just couldn't have enough food. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And uh on the 20th of April, I volunteered to to the Czechoslovak army to go back to the front, so then I uh was inducted in, back into the regular army and uh as we went through the induction period, you know, suddenly there is a colonel there and he said, "You know, you have this unbelievable military record here. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">Uh we need you in uh really in a special assignment. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">We are going to send you to <span class="BUILDING">officer school</span> ," and I said, you know, "But the war will be over!", </span><span class="sentence" id="802">I said. "</span><span class="sentence" id="803">Oh, we'll make you an officer in two weeks." </span><span class="sentence" id="804">So I was sent uh on the 20th of April to a real quickie battlefield officer school. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Turned out it was a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> of what do you do with collaborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">They needed sort of a few people that would come over and uh go through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sudetenland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">I mean there was some...all of that thing was laid out so I uh...at graduation they discovered that I was only sixteen years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Until then, nobody asked me and they just couldn't make me an officer, so they made me a non-commissioned officer, whatever that means. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">So immediately after liberation I was shipped uh to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="810">Uh, of course I stopped <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Nobody was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">I found out that my sister and my mother were both picked up uh in October in, you know, in their <span class="NPIP">hiding places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="813">So my instinct was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">I mean the staying in the <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> would have been just terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">And uh so I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bratislava</span> , and we started hunting the Nazis and I did that for about four months and the thing just got too ghastly for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">I mean I mean I mean we we just did pretty rotten things and and uh we we uh settled scores. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">I mean it was a pretty wild period. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And uh then my sister came back from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in June, and I just told my superiors I had enough of this thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">You know, I just didn't have the stomach, so uh they said, "Well uh most of the Nazis fled anyway so we don't have as big a job to do as we thought we have to do and besides you're sixteen years old," and uh there were some other reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">They say, "Well why don't you just go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="821">So I was honorably discharged from the army and then I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="822">At the age of sixteen, a non-commissioned officer, uh gun-toting, uh no education, uh no schooling since '39, '40, and uh and I decided, had to decide what to do with myself and my decision was when I went back uh to <span class="COUNTRY">Slovakia</span> and and I saw the accumulation of grudges...and it has nothing to do with the communist plot or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">It's just...the the totalitarian regime, the the bureaucratic structure, the the theft, the institutionalized theft, the legalized uh destruction of people... concluded at the age of sixteen that that regardless what...and you know, I was going to get the property back and since I was the sole male heir of a huge, huge property, <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and God knows what because my uncles got killed and everything else, you know, uh there was every reason for me to stay there and I said I'm just not going to do it, so I walked out in January of 1948, before the communists took over. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">Just walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">I went first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="826">Then I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="827">There was a friend of my father's, not family, who uh sort of picked me up and uh very dear friend of my father's. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">He was not married and uh he sort of fed me, put me through <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , private tutoring, and I arrived in uh in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> early in February 1948 and then I finally got a visa to, as as an orphan, to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and I arrived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in October of 1948.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="829">QUESTION: Take a couple of minutes, and we have a couple of minutes...
ANSWER: Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="830">QUESTION: Tell us what your adjustment to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> has been.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="831">ANSWER: That's a long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">That's a long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">Uh, you know, so far as I'm concerned, <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ...the gold is on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="834">You can just pick it up. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">You know, you know...that was my vision of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I was dreaming about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> when I was still starving and marching. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And I don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">You know, just going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> ...that was going to be the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I wanted to have peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="840">I just wanted to have peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">So my adjustment was that I just wanted to have peace and raise a family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="842">QUESTION: What do you think the effect of the war has been on you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="843">ANSWER: I think it has been very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">I think it has been very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">I think that uh...I know this is almost a sacrilege to say, but I'm a better person for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">But I'm just a lucky one. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">There are very very few who are able to to walk through the war without the ultimate degradation, the dignity to human to humanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">See, I was always a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">I could always stand up. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I never owed anything to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">And I think the biggest crime, and it's not just the Nazis although that's an extreme form, is the degradation and demoralization, the the the total helplessness that people get in an environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">And the great thing about <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , you can be whatever you want to be, and uh I think I'm a much better person for that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="854">ANSWER:  Well, uh like my father I always have an obligation to society and uh uh I came in in uh "48. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">I was very lucky to be accepted to the only <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> that gave full tuition uh scholarship to every student, which is Cooper Union. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">Cooper Union in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> is the only place I could afford going. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">I couldn't even afford going to <span class="BUILDING">City College</span> because I didn't have $130 to pay for lab fees. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">And uh always wanted to be an engineer. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">Always, since a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">I went to HIAS on <span class="DLF">Lafayette Street</span> in '48 when I arrived and uh I went to the counselor and I said, you know, "I want to be an engineer," and they say, "Kid, you know, you have no education, no schooling, nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">And you have no money and we don't know what to to say." </span><span class="sentence" id="862">I say, "Well, I just want to be an engineer," so so finally the counselor in desperation said "You know, around the corner is this crazy <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that everybody who gets in gets paid everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Why don't you try them out?" </span><span class="sentence" id="864">So I went to this this Cooper Union and I talked to the admission officer and he said, "You know, it's pretty tough. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">Have you ever taken an SAT?" </span><span class="sentence" id="866">I said, "Well, what's an SAT?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="867">Well, you know, fill these forms and what have you." </span><span class="sentence" id="868">My English was pretty poor so I sat for an SAT exam without any of the cultural background, as you must understand, to take a multiple choice forms...it is a pretty crazy thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Turned out that because of Cooper Union rating...my English was terrible, but for spacial relationships I got a perfect score. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">You know, when you turn a cube this way, is it like this cube or that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cube</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I thought it was a game. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">I got into computer, uh Cooper Union, but not...I got in because somebody backed out, so I went to <span class="BUILDING">Cooper Union</span> , worked my way through Cooper Union, and uh met my wife at <span class="BUILDING">Cooper Union</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="873">And then uh I felt I was not sufficiently educated and then I uh got a scholarship to <span class="BUILDING">MIT Sloane School</span> --and uh just to tell you the attitude, although I was totally abjectly poor, I...you know, I wore work clothing that I...second- hand clothing--I refused to take the scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I said, "I'm going to work my way through through through <span class="BUILDING">MIT</span> and the reason is the Strassman's don't take charity from anybody." </span><span class="sentence" id="875">So I walked, uh went and got a Master's Degree in Industrial Management and I did the first dissertation in the United States of business application of computers. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">I just happened to fall into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span> in 1954. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">I mean this was just just just just a stupid piece of luck. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">The only <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there was a computer and so I stayed with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span> since '54 and if you got into <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span> in '54, honestly, you were a total idiot. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">I mean, you know, just just couldn't do wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">So I stayed with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span> my entire career until retirement in 1985, when I was the Chief Information Executive for the Xerox Corporation worldwide. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I managed computers for <span class="BUILDING">General Foods</span> , Kraft and Xerox, but I stayed my entire career, uh thirty years, in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Didn't change, and now I'm retired and uh I write. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">I teach. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">I have two professorships and uh I serve on a six-man board to the Secretary of Defense uh again helping out on on how to manage <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">computers</span> for increasing the defense of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
