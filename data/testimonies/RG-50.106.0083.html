ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  And what is your family name, your maiden name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My maiden name was Politzer. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">That’s like the Pulitzer prize, but with an O. And it was always Hedi Politzer. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">As I say, the Hedwig was not something that I especially cherished, even as a child.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  And where were you born and when were you born?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Iwas born March 18", 1920 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , the capital of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I have an older sister, there are just the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">My parents were both born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and they were both born in 1887. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">So we’re really going back to the Victorian age, the Gay 90s, whatever you want to call it, and my upbringing, I think, was accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="9">QUESTION:  What is your sister’s name, and when was she born? </span><span class="sentence" id="10">November 6, 1997
ANSWER:  My sister Ava — Eva — Ava, I guess, Ava Politzer, she is not married. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">She was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> also in June 1915.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your parents, how — and also how far back the family goes in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Both my parents came from rather prosperous, middle class, I guess you would call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Both grandfathers were prominent businessmen in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Grandfather Ludwig Politzer was born somewhere in the far reaches of the Hapsburg empire in what is now <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , I guess, and came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> as a very young man, to learn the language and to absorb a little culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">That was the thing to do for young people with any kind of ambition, to come to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">capital</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">It was, of course, the cultural center, right after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rome</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="19">He had a very interesting gold and silver — he was a gold and silversmith in a ta — 1n a stre — on a <span class="DLF">street</span> that was called Papagenogasse, which is rather — rather very Viennese, you know, Papa Geno is one of the characters in “The Magic Flute.” </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And a very interesting thing about Grandpa Politzer, we never really knew what kind of an artist he was, and in — in eight — in 1981, when the <span class="BUILDING">Metropolitan Museum</span> had a beautiful exp — exhibit of Hapsburg treasures and — and costumes, we suddenly stood in front of a big, big [indecipherable] I call it, exhibit of jewelry that Hungarian noblemen wore, and it was made by Ludwig Politzer in circa — it said November 6, 1997 circa 1872. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So my sister and I just — just — just couldn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I mean, this was just an unbelievable thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">We traced it down and it is now the property of the <span class="BUILDING">Imperial Museum</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Budapest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And to try to get hold of somebody who knew something about it was — this was 1981, I said, was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So I’m still trying to figure out how I could see it one more time. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">But this was a — a beautiful thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Also, he has a — a very interesting piece exhibited in one of the <span class="BUILDING">museums</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">So unbeknownst to us when we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , he was apparently quite — quite an artist. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">The business was later on carried on after his death by one of the brothers of my father’s, but I don’t really know what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">It doesn’t exist any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">The other grandfather also came from somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , as a very young man, about 15 years old, to learn something besides Hungarian. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And he turned out to be a very well-known businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">He had the most — best known haberdashery, I guess you would call it, on what would be the Fifth Avenue of Vienna, called <span class="DLF">Karntner Strasse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And once or twice a year he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> for buying materials and — and — and for made-to-order suits for men and women. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">It was called the English fleet, the Englisch-Flotte, it was very well known, and it was, until about 10 years ago, carried on by a much younger child of hi — much younger than my mother’s child, but that’s a long family story that I don’t think I have time to relate. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Well, anyway, they were both very prosperous. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">My father’s family had — November 6, 1997 there were two sisters and five brothers, seven. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And my father, Oscar Politzer was the youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">My mother’s family, there were two older sisters and one younger brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">My mother’s name was Marie, but she was all — always Mitzi, little Mitzi because she was tiny and very, very delicate. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And all she really knew how to do was play the piano. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">That was the thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And both <span class="BUILDING">households</span> had a cook and a maid, and in my mother’s family there was a mademoiselle that came several afternoons a week because you had to learn another language, absolutely. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And my father’s family with the five boys especially, there was a sort of a tutor, another — another teacher who saw that homework was being done by these — by this big family. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I — I think this 1s important to — to realize how very much entrenched this — both families were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They were socially and financially very, very much Viennese.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  And what kind of work did your father do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  My father was, I guess you’d call it a businessman. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">He was supposed to — to, with his brother-in-law, my mother’s brother, take over the business from my maternal grandfather, but things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Grandpa Berger was his name, was widowed er — er — ma — at age 60, and remarried a much, much younger woman, to the great distress of the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And they had another child, and that other child, of course, was inheriting the business, instead of the son and son-in-law and that was November 6, 1997 that. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">So my father had — it’s hard to — to translate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He — he represented foreign firms. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">He was a businessman, and business was not good. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">We’re talking — my parents were married in 1914, beginning of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And the time between the wars was economically very bad in Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So we had everything a child would need. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And besides, you didn’t talk business with your children. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I was really not aware of what my father did. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">I wouldn’t say I didn’t care, but you just didn’t discuss it with your children.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Did your mother work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  No, Mother did not work, and it’s — it’s interesting, because she was a very, very talented and very smart woman, but girls of this age in that level of society just didn’t work. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">There was — she played the piano very well, and I guess she knew how to cook, because she had to learn it. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">But then we always had a maid or somebody else who cooked, so Mother didn’t — I mean, she brought up my sister and me, but that was about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">QUESTION:  How religious was your family?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Not at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Did you celebrate any religious holidays?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">We had a Christmas tree, and the 24" of December was sort of a family reunion. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">We had a Christmas tree with real candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And there were always November 6, 1997 two big pitchers of water standing nearby, because we always had one or two mine — little minor fir-fires. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">But that — that was it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Was Christmas a religious holiday for you, or —
ANSWER:  No.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  —acivil hol — a civil holiday?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">ANSWER:  It was strictly a civil holiday. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We didn’t go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or midnis — mass, or anything like that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">QUESTION:  Did you ever go to any <span class="BUILDING">synagogue services</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">ANSWER:  Very rarely. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I remember one wedding of a cousin, much older cousin, that I attended, but that was about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">Which seems strange, but that’s the way it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Well now, let’s talk about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">Let’s talk about your childhood, and also your <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> where your family lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Was it a mixed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> of Jews and non-Jews when you were growing up?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  You’re asking me a question I really don’t know how to answer, because I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">Even though you hear a lot and read a lot about rising anti-Semitism, I was not aware of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I had friends — I had Jewish friends and I had, of course, the state religion, so to speak, in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> was Catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">So most people were Catholics, but there were some Protestants. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And you just didn’t pay too much attention to where people went on Sundays, or if they went at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">November 6, 1997
QUESTION:  What kind of <span class="BUILDING">school</span> did you go to as a young child?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="91">ANSWER:  I went to four years of <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , and then —
QUESTION:  Was this a <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER: <span class="BUILDING"> Public school</span> , yes, definitely <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , very close by to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I walked —I could walk by myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And after four years of <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> , you had to decide whether you wanted to go to an eight year <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , which was <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , or just four years of — which was called <span class="BUILDING">Hauptschule</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Most of the time, if you just didn’t make very good grades, and couldn’t really do very well, you went to <span class="BUILDING">Hauptschule</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">Or if there was no money at all — cause you did pay a little bit for <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">And children went to <span class="BUILDING">Hauptschule</span> if they wanted to follow a trade. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">It’s th-the sy — the school system 1s very ve — was very different and still is very different from he — here in the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> I went to a eight year <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , which was very strict, very difficult and very, very cut and dry academic, I would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And I’m — I’m glad I had the good education I had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  While you were going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I assume you had no religious training at — at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Did you have any hobbies or other interests, besides <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  From age five on, I danced. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I was gonna be a dancer, and I was gonna have a <span class="BUILDING">dance studio</span> , somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And that was that, and the opportunities, of course, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> were tremendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Our <span class="BUILDING">household</span> was very much infused with music. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We November 6, 1997 had a beautiful Bosendorfer. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">That’s one of the big, big, beautiful <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">pianos</span> we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Mother played quite a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">My sister had piano lessons, seemed forever. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And Mother tried piano lessons for me, but I just couldn’t sit still long enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">So I — I had — Mother was my teacher for about three years and then we both gave up, and I’m truly sorry I did, but I gave up. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">So I — I danced two, three afternoons a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">You know, <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was from about — well, em — <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> it was from eight to 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Then in <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> you went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> every day from eight to one, and it c — also on Saturdays, so the — the dance classes came in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And very early in life, I did a lot of performing. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">That was really what I — what I loved. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">One of my teachers was a-— one of the soloists at the <span class="BUILDING">Staatsoper</span> , and she had a <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> on the side, and was also often asked to choreograph for the Burgtheater, which was the dramatic stage — this dramatic, state supported stage. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And there I had all sorts of opportunities. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">I got paid something, which amounts to nowadays probably for about 10 cents. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">But at the time it was — it was great to have a little — little money to save, and I usually saved it up to go on a skiing trip, because that was the other — I would n— wouldn’t know whether it was a hobby, but everybody skied, and we also skated. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I— we had membership to one of the <span class="DLF">ice skating rinks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And then every year, that was later on in <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , the whole <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , or those who couldn’t ski well, they had to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , went somewhere for a week, into one of the <span class="BUILDING">youth hostels</span> in November 6, 1997 the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> , and just looking back on it, this was probably the most beautiful, best times we ever had.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  What language did you speak with your parents at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Well, we spoke German, and although people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> don’t always want to admit that Austrians speak German, it is Volksdeutsche. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">So that was the language we — I had seven years of French in ha — in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , in <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> , four years of Latin and about two or three years of English. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So we — tha-that was very much — everybody had to take languages. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And French was really usually the first foreign language. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Now it’s — it’s English, but in those days it was always French was the first foreign language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">QUESTION:  Were your parents, or maybe specifically your father, very politically oriented, politically involved?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">ANSWER:  No, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">At least that’s the way it seemed to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I have no way of — of knowing, but no, my answer would be no. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">I — my — my mother’s brother George, he was two or three years younger than my mother, was terribly proud of his World War I record. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">He was in the cavalry, and it was hard to get into the cavalry. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">I don’t know whether you had to pay somebody to get in, or it was the uniform, that beautiful red pants, red trousers and blue jacket that was expensive, but he was very proud to have been in the cavalry. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And was wounded in World War I, he had a very November 6, 1997 badly crippled hand from — from a wound in World War I. And later on, after the war was over, he joined a party called the Ligity-misten(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They were — I don’t know whether it was a political party or just like an association, people who wanted to have the Habsburg — the Habsburgs back. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And later on, when the Nazis marched in, that was — was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I’ll come to that later.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="140">QUESTION:  Was your father Zionistic at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="141">ANSWER:  Not at all, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Religion had — had absolutely nothing — no — no impact on me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  Did you feel Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">ANSWER:  No, I never did. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">And I —
QUESTION:  Did you know that you were born Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  Yes, yes, that I knew, but it was just something that was just sort of glossed over, I guess you would call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">It’s hard to believe, but that’s the way it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  What kind of relationship did you have with your parents? </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Was it the kind that you could talk things over with, did you have especially close relationship?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">ANSWER:  Well, I think the relationship was close, yes, but close for these years, for — for the — for the years in the — in the 20s. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Probably not for now. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I’m — I’m very close with my daughter now, much closer than I ever was with my mother.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">QUESTION:  What about your relationship when you were a child, with your sister? </span><span class="sentence" id="154">November 6, 1997
ANSWER:  Well, we — we fought, like all sisters do, but basically it was a friendship and we're still very good friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  Now let’s move to 1933. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">You are 13 years old, and Hitler has come into power in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Do you recall — okay, obviously you were quite young — any changes that you were aware of when he f— from 19 — in the early — you know, 1933, in the beginning?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  Well, I want to go back few — few years before that. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">We talked about the Soltsis(ph) and the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">The Soltsis(ph) were the social democrats, and the Nazis were — you know, the word Nazi comes from Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">So there was this talk, and of course children pick up things. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">So neither one was particularly good, but the social democrats were the leading party after World War I.

<p><span class="sentence" id="166">ANSWER:  — government at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So I— I’m — I was aware that there was something — something going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">This was in ’31. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">1933, yes, we heard about Hitler, but that was November 6, 1997 next door. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">That was — that was far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">It’s hard to believe this nowadays, but you know, we didn’t have television. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We had just gotten a radio, and communications just weren’t — and besides, I was 13 years old, I had too many other things I — I wanted to think about and do. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">So we — yes, we knew about Hitler, but that was about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Then things became more serious. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">In 1934, and I remember that very well, that the Chancellor Dollfuss — I don’t think one even knows the name here, was murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">He was the — the Austrian chancellor. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And it was very obvious that the Nazis from — the German Nazis were behind that terrible murder. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">It was in July, and I was on vacation at one of my aunt’s <span class="BUILDING">villas</span> on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lake</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And we were very, very worried about what was really happening there. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">But then that calmed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Dollfuss successor was Kurt von Schuschnigg, and he was a very, very different kind of chancellor. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">I remember Chancellor Dollfuss, he was a very short man, he was just five foot tall, and he was the butt of a lot of jokes. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">But he was a very popular man, he had a great deal of rapport with the — with the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And the — this new man, von Schuschnigg was a kind of a college professor type. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Very serious, seemingly not a whole lot of sense of humor, and he was also at the time, the head of the Heimwehr. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Heimwehr was sort of a militia type party, 1t was a different party. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">It was somewhere between the Nazis and the Soltsis(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And a lot of the Heimwehr — Heimwehr people were aristocrats that at one time of course November 6, 1997 were for the return of the Habsburgs. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So he definitely lacked popular appeal. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And I think he — he had absolutely no way of communicating with Hitler, he wasn’t even trying. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">And he was the wrong type to ever meet up with Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">This is — this was 1934. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">The — 1936, of course, was the year of the Olympics, which the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> so very, very beautifully, I thought that was a marvelous decision, whoever made it, to have that year show other Olympics, because I remember that very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">I was very much into athletics and of course we realized that Hitler used this as a tremendous propaganda tool, the — the Olympic games. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And we were so, so taken by this beautiful black man Jesse Owens. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">He was — but it was — it was very, very — there were several Austrian competitors, one or two of them were Jewish, who were not allowed to participate the last moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So it was a very, very strained. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">It started — it started to be very, very strained.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="199">QUESTION:  When Hitler came to power in 1933, and as the year started to go on, did you yourself think more about being Jewish, or did that not enter your mind? </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I’m talking, you know, even up through the ’36 Olympics.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  No, this — this didn’t really — I don’t know, I — I — it’s funny that I have no — no feeling, no — no memories that I said oh dear, you know, what’s gonna happen? </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Just not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">This really didn’t happen until after 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">I had in s — in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , of course there was a — we knew that there was an underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">The underground Nazi November 6, 1997 movement started when Schuschnigg came in because he — he did a lot of — lot of really very, very awkward things. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">He tried to outlaw the National Socialist party in <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and that was the wrong thing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">They went underground there. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">So right — right on my right side, we — we sat in — in — 1n <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desks</span> that were three or four. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">The girl on my right side, I knew wore a little swastika on her lapel, on the underside of her lapel. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">The girl on my left, her father was in the military, and he was to be the Austrian attaché in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">So you know, I had a little bit of a political fallout there on — on either side of — but we were — we were friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">I think the girl who wore the swastika on the — on the side of the lapel knew that I knew she wore it. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">But that was alright, you know, it — and we also knew that there were certain — certain professors, certain teachers who we knew were — were Nazis, but they — they didn’t make any — any difference, they didn’t treat us any different. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">It was — it was interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">When I think back of it, there was very little of this polit — it didn’t come down to the youngsters, let’s say, ti — our age group.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">QUESTION:  So you yourself never, up until 1938, you yourself never experienced any difficulty, any anti-Semitic overtones?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">ANSWER:  Not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Not at all that I — that I can remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Maybe there was, there probably was, underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">But a teenager just didn’t pay too much attention to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">I —I went to a very nice <span class="BUILDING">dance school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">That’s — when I say that, it’s the social November 6, 1997 dancing, the same — same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that my mother went to, and he’s still there, the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> is still there, only not th — the man is long dead, but there you know, you would have — would have said you — you — perhaps there were any — any differences who could come into this <span class="BUILDING">class</span> or that class. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">But I just don’t remember that there was any discrimination like this, I just truly don’t.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">QUESTION:  And you didn’t see any evidences on the <span class="DLF">street</span> or with <span class="BUILDING">businesses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">What about your father’s work?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">ANSWER:  No, my father’s work actually, I think he had some work with <span class="BUILDING">German firms</span> , I don’t know what happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I — I really, as I said before, there was very little business talk, and children were — it was just like — like not in front of the children kind of a — kind of an attitude, which seems strange, but that’s — that’s the way, at least in my family was the way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  Well, now let’s move through — through 1937, and now to March ’38, unless there’s anything in 1937 you wanted to cover.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  Not particularly. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">I think there were — there were signs that — that Hitler — it seems to me that — that Mr. Dollfuss and Mr. Schuschnigg were good friends with Mussolini. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">That was of course on our south, you know, we were in between. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And Mussolini was — was very friendly to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and he — the way I — I read some of the stuff now in retrospect, after almost 60 years, he tried to — to tell Hitler to stay November 6, 1997 out of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , because I think he — he want — he was afraid of Hitler like everybody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">So when — when Hitler made moves to — which he did, to invite Schuschnigg to come to see him, Mussolini told him that he thought that was a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And he also told Schuschnigg not to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">But I don’t know what happened in 1937, but I know 1938, early 1938, January, February, Schuschnigg finally had to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berchtesgaden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And I remember that — that period very well, because I was in my last year of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And there was a sort of an unwritten law, at least it was — my parents insisted that I didn’t go to any of the big carnival [indecipherable] it was called, until I was a senior in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So this was my — my time to go to — to balls, and — and the political situation seemed so — so uncertain and so — it was so, so gray, and so, so unpleasant that I was afraid they were all going to spoil my fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">But I did manage to go do some of the dances. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">But I do remember the time that Schuschnigg went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berchtesgaden</span> , I remember that — that very well, because even though we only had radio, it was all given over the radio and there was also something called — here it was called March of Time, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">You went to the movies for just about 45 minutes, and you had the news there. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">So we — we got a lot of that through — through these films. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And there were reports of how, for about two hours Hitler just raved and ranted and would not take — accept anything that Schuschnigg suggested. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And Schuschnigg at the time had a November 6, 1997 minister — I don’t know minister of what, but his name was Guido Schmidt, who was really a Nazi. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">But he came with Schuschnigg and kind of egged him on and say oh, come on, give in, make a few little — little allowances. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">But it was a totally — total disaster, that meeting that he had with Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">He came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and if I remember right, I think 1t was a — it was a secret to the Austrian population that he was actually there. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">I don’t think we knew about it until he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And it was a — I mean, we were told that it was no good, and Schuschnigg suggested a plebiscite. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And Hitler said absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">But Schuschnigg did it anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">And that truly was the straw that broke the camel’s back because that was just — Hitler was just waiting for — for an occasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">So on March 11", he — his army crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And I remember that extremely well because I was at a dance rehearsal. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">See, by then I was — I was 17 going on 18 and I really — I was very serious about my dancing and this was gonna be a production of Faust, second part of Faust, under Max Reinhardt, and that — of course he was the — the — the god of the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And this was Friday evening and the rehearsal was called off. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And of course that whole thing was called off because Reinhardt was one of the first that crossed the <span class="DLF">border</span> ; he was smart, he left, Friday the 11. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">And then Saturday the Luftwaffe flew over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and Sunday the 13", Hitler came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">And I will never forget that, because even though we were told not to go da — out on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , of course we — November 6, 1997 we young people wanted to see, no matter — whether we’re for or against, but you — you wanted to see, and this Sunday night, I had tickets to go to the <span class="BUILDING">opera</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I had a—a boyfriend at the time who was in his one year of army duty, military duty, and he had cheap tickets, or free tickets, probably. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Well, you couldn’t — you couldn’t cross the <span class="DLF">street</span> in front of the opera, I mean th — the ring — there’s the — there’s a big <span class="DLF">avenue</span> that goes around the old <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , called the ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And all along the ring are the beautiful <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , like the opera, and the — the <span class="BUILDING">parliament</span> , and the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and the <span class="BUILDING">Burgtheater</span> and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">Well, people stood 10 deep to see the parade, so we never made it to the opera. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">In fact, at the opera, people were hanging out fo — of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , and it was sort of stormed by the — by the people who wanted to see the parade, and of course, Hitler himself, he was standing up in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with his right handed lifted, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">So it was rather — rather impossible thing to erase out of your head, the noise —
QUESTION:  What were your thoughts when you — you — you said you saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">parade</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">QUESTION:  And what were your thoughts?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I don’t know whether we thought that we — we had heard that the last few years, Jews really had a hard time in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Their businesses were either closed, or they were not allowed to do this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But people still — still had November 6, 1997 a life in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="272">It wasn’t the — the horror — the Holocaust really didn’t start until several years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">So we figured well, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> — because we always — the Austrians always felt oh, it won’t happen here, you know, that’s the Austrian temperament. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">But I don’t know whether — whether I — I was very busy trying to finish <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">That’s — that’s my feeling now, but I don’t know at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">I think my parents were — were terribly undone by it. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">But they too felt, oh well, yes, the kids should probably leave, but we’ll somehow stick it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">It was that attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">QUESTION:  You said the day before was Saturday and the Luftwaffe came flying by. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">What were your thoughts then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">ANSWER:  I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">I s — I— I was told to stay <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and everybody stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , because it was — by then you really had the feeling — see we — we thought that there was gonna be a fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">We thought there was gonna be a war. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">We had a small Austrian army, but I think they were totally overwhelmed by the thought of the — of the German army and the Luftwaffe, so that they decided well, we better not have a bloodbath. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I think that was the idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">So one stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .</span></p>

QUESTION:  Why wouldn’t you think about it?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  Well, because, first of all I— you — you had to declare that you had eight Gentile — Aryan it was called — grandparents. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And then I know a lot of people who did not join the Hitler youth. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">You didn’t — you didn’t have to. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">You were told you had to, but if you didn’t join, you had to explain why. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">So it was a — I think that was probably the first feeling of oh, we better have — we have to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">If you — if you not part of the Hitler youth, you couldn’t do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So I can’t really answer that question, I don’t know what I felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">As I said, I was busy. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">End of — end of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> was a very — it was very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">There was something called Matura which was oral and written exams, very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">It was a sort of a summary of your — your <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> years, and we had to study hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">So we still were going to finish this. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So that week of vacation, which I guess it was, I don’t know just exactly what I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">I— I’m sorry, I can’t tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">November 6, 1997 End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B

QUESTION:  How did you react to that, knowing that she had to go because she was Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="326">ANSWER:  Well, you better not react it, because if you expressed yourself to somebody, you were not certain what that other person — how that other person would react, and perhaps tell somebody that Hedi said such and such, and then that could hurt my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">QUESTION:  How did you know it could possibly hurt your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="328">November 6, 1997

<p><span class="sentence" id="450">ANSWER:  Okay, of course they were both born Politzer, older brother of my father’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And Helen, the one that went to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and came over here, never married, so her — she stayed a Politzer. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And the other one’s name was Freid(ph), and that’s an interesting story, but I don’t think [Pll have to tell — the time to tell about her.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">QUESTION:  Her first name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="454">ANSWER:  Anna and Helen. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And they — when you sh — when you have — want — have some — somebody to immigrate, you have to furnish an affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">There was a — a new thing too, the quota and affidavit we had, those were new words in our vocabulary. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And these two ladies did not have enough money to — didn’t earn enough to — to say, we'll take care of these. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">So we had to find somebody with more money. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And my mother had some old friends, two bachelor brothers who I think grew up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , that she wrote to. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">And this was very brave of her, because I don’t think she’d heard from them, I mean, I don’t know how many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And they immediately answered, says yes, by all means, we’ll let you have an affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">And I think it was the idea they had to do it with these two cousins, because — here again, this is interesting about the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , two bachelor brothers could not bring 1n two November 6, 1997 young ladies. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Which makes sense, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">So between the — this was a joint affidavit, between the two men, who had enough money, and the two women who had all the family love you could wish for, that said okay, we’ll take care of these two young women.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="608">ANSWER:  Well, you — we didn’t know when we were going to see our parents again, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">By then Mother was alone, but my uncle and aunt, her sister, had moved in with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">And we were terribly afraid that something was going to happen to Uncle November 6, 1997 Alfred, because he was president or vice-president of a company that had its headsqu — head — <span class="BUILDING">headquarters</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="611">And not only — of course it was the — by then he had lost his job, and we were terribly afraid that something’s gonna happen to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">Well, nothing did, and they lived with my mother until they all together came over here in 1940, and Mother could join us. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">But the — the idea that — that our father was at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and — and Mother was alone was — was pretty awful.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  I felt very bad — badly leaving the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , but as I said before, going to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was quite an adventure, and there were quite a few — before things happened, before things got bad, a lot of young people, not as young as I was, maybe a little older, went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="634">The ones that — with a sense of adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">November 6, 1997 <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was — was where — where — where it was at, you know, we got all the — the — the movies, the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movies, and this sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">So <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> seemed like quite the — quite the <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, cause a lot of people did not have the good luck to go to — to the u — to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> , they had to go to the <span class="COUNTRY">Dominican Republic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">And I know of people who went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Columbia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Bolivia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="638">And that was just not as — not as attractive as going to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> But it was — I had very mixed feelings, I’m sure I did.</span></p>

QUESTION:  So now you’ve landed, you’ve met — and your — did you go directly to <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="750">ANSWER:  We went directly to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newark</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , yes, and so what are we gonna do next? </span><span class="sentence" id="751">Well, everybody — we were called refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">Oh, we were one of the big army of refugees, and I got to hate that word. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">And we came with all sorts of addresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Everybody had people to call on that could help. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">And some — some of them were very unlikely. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">But very soon — my — my sister very soon found a job with a family to take care of some children. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And I was determined I was gonna dance. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And I didn’t — didn’t find anything right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And of course, within a week, we got a letter from our s — our mother that our father had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Which meant of course, everything just — just kind of fell apart there for a few days, and oh, our cousins were wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">But we had to pick ourselves up. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">As I said before, we he — we each had 40 dollars. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">And it’s amazing how far 40 dollars went in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">So we —
QUESTION:  What — what date did you actually land in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="765">ANSWER:  We landed on the 23" — or was it 25""? </span><span class="sentence" id="766">I think it was the 25" of January. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">I always get mixed up between the landing and my father’s death. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">I think his — he died on the 23" of January, and I think we landed on the 25", something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">So it was — it was very cold in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Newark</span> , <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> and we started going into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , which meant you had a little s — little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> ride that cost 10 cents. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">Then you did the November 6, 1997 <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Hudson tubes</span> , which cost a nickel. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And then you had the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">subway</span> , another nickel. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">So there went, if 1t’s a round trip, 40 cents went for transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">And of course, if you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and you were a whole day, you had to have lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">So at Niddick’s(ph) you could get a na — a frankfurt for four or five cents, and an orange drink for five cents. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">And if you were still hungry you could get a cream cheese and nut bread for five cents. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">So for, let’s see, 40 cents fare and 15 cents, that’s pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">You still didn’t have to pay more than 55 cents for the day. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">So those 40 dollars went for — for quite some time, and everything else, our cousins were beautiful about it, and took care of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">My sister, as I said, then she gave up the — the job of taking care of children, and she at the time, of course, had — knew shorthand and typing and she was fluent in French. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Her English was better than mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">So she found some secretarial work very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">And I got in touch with somebody who had — who was the pianist for one of my dance teachers. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">He was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and I looked him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">He was also the nephew of somebody we knew, so it was almost like a friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">And he says well, he said, it just so happens that I got together with somebody from one of the <span class="BUILDING">cabarets</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and they’re forming a new group, and they found some sponsors, and maybe they can use a dancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">And I got in touch with this person who was — whose name was Herbert Berghof and he was very well known actor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and I did my little twirling around with my November 6, 1997 dance dress, and I had a record on the record player. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And he says, well, I think maybe we can use you. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">And they had just started rehearsal — this was in February — and we got rehearsal pay, 15 dollars a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">Now that’s — that was good. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">That was very good. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">So I started rehearsing with this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">It was an interesting group, they were something called fromme a kleine kunst Buhne, which literally translated means small stage theater. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">It was a — sort of a topical review that had been very successful in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">And they got out quickly, because it was the kind of a topical review that made fun of politics, and — and they — they better — had to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">So they met again in vien — in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> with Herbert Berghof as a director, and they had sponsors, a list of sponsors that you wouldn’t believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">George S. Kaufman and his wife, Irving Berlin, Edna Ferber, down the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">They all — I don’t — I have no idea how much money they — they gave, but it was a little corporation that was formed, called itself the refugee artists’ group. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">And they got a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and we opened a show in June 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">And for — as I said, rehearsal pay was 15 dollars a week, and then when we opened, we got 40 dollars a week, which was the minimum that actors’ equity paid. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">And you know, all the other refugees made anywhere from 12 dollars, 15 dollars, 20 dollars, but nobody made 40 dollars a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">So I really thought I had it made. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">This was summer 1939, it was terribly hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">There were all but four <span class="BUILDING">theaters</span> opened on Broadway because they were the only November 6, 1997 four that had air conditioning. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">And the music box, where I was doing my thing, was one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">It was just a glorious two month. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">And interestingly enough, for some reason or other, some time before I got in with that group and knew that it was really gonna do something, I had applied for college scholarships. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">That was another address I had, to be sure and go to the international students’ service, and apply for a scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Of course, I did really not know what a scholarship was and I really didn’t terribly want to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> because I had done my Matura and I was not that brilliant a student. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">So I had applied anyway, and the woman there didn’t speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">I — my English was very broken, so we got along just fine and — and she said, well, you might hear from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">And sometime in August I got a beautiful letter from International Student Service that said, we have scholarship for you at <span class="BUILDING">Miami University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="812">And I just had totally forgotten that I had ever applied. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">And I was so happy performing on Broadway, I really didn’t want to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And there was some friends — friends of my cousin’s, wonderful woman who lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , who was in radio and the arts, says, you’d be a darn fool if you wouldn’t take this. </span><span class="sentence" id="815">Said, I don’t want to. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">She said, well, you better. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">And of course, war clouds over Europe, very, very obvious things were going to — to be really bra — breaking there very quickly. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">And this show had very good critiques, but somehow November 6, 1997 we being refugees and foreigners, with the war breaking out, 1t was all a bad situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">We had to be fingerprinted because we were enemy aliens. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">So —
QUESTION:  Was it — was the troupe primarily a Jewish troupe?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="821">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">Some — some were, some were not. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And so I reluctantly said to Herbert, you know, I’m going to go to coll — Herbert was the director — I was gonna have a scholarship. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">He says oh, I hate to lose you. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">I said, well, what do you think of the show”? </span><span class="sentence" id="826">He says well, it may just fold. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">And it did. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And I want off to Miami University, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Oxford</span> , <span class="REGION">Ohio</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="829">So that was one of those decisions that I did the right thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">At the time it was — it was very difficult, and I had to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> where my sister was, and I was suddenly thrown into a totally, totally different environment. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">It was a good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And I think from then on in, I realized that there’s more to it than just staying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> and being surrounded by nothing but refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And it was a — it was a good — it was the best decision I ever made.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="834">QUESTION:  How did the other students ac-accept — accept you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="835">ANSWER:  Well, I’m gonna write a book about that some time. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">In fact, at my f— my 50" reunion at <span class="BUILDING">Miami University</span> , I was asked to give a speech, and it was mostly on Am-Americanization. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">And <span class="BUILDING">Miami University</span> was a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to — to get it. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">I think some of them thought I was from the <span class="NPIP">moon</span> , and they — they — you know, <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Venice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="839">I mean, it was all very confusing and what November 6, 1997 did you speak, what language did you speak? </span><span class="sentence" id="840">And I couldn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">I got — I went to the — the registrar didn’t really know what to do with me, or whoever says whether I’m a freshman or a sophomore. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">He said, well, we’ll see. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">I brought my — my report cards, but you know, they were all in German. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">So I guess I got sophomore status right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">And I said, yes, but I just want to dance, I don’t want to play basketball. </span><span class="sentence" id="846">Well, I had to take all these things, cause I was a physical edu — physical education major. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">And the faculty was just wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">I mean, I can’t — I can’t say enough of the — the kindness that — that was extended to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">The students were kind of strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">I think they re — really didn’t know — I was dating some, but very little, because my English wasn’t good enough, and I think it was too much work to go out with somebody who didn’t speak the language.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="851">QUESTION:  Were there other students in your position?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="852">ANSWER:  Yes, there was a — a — there was an Italian boy, young man from Rose(ph), but he was Italian, for some reason or other. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">And there was a Hungarian and a German — two German girls, and a whole group of Indonesians. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And their English was — was nonexistent, so I don’t know how they got along. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">But I had — I just — the faculty was just wonderful, because I’d had to take freshman English, and this woman sat down with me, and you know, corrected, and taught me, pronounced and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">I — I immediately got a part in a play because the word got out that I’d been on November 6, 1997 Broadway, you know, that was — so — so this — this marvelous man, who was a well-known Shakespeare scholar of all things, gave me a part in the — 1n the — in “Twelfth Night,” and sat down with me and worked on pronunciation. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">So there were all these wonderful things that happened, and I — my grades were strange in the first semester, but my English was — by Christmas my English was a hundred percent better, and I graduated with a B.S. in 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="858">QUESTION:  What kind of nata — and your mother, you said, came over when?</span></p>
