<p><span class="sentence" id="1523">QUESTION:  Right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1524">ANSWER:  As we call it, the receptor — and by the way, just to be fair, there was three <span class="BUILDING">laboratories</span> that made the discovery si-simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1525">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1526">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">One was Pert and Snyder at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hopkins</span> , <span class="BUILDING">Johns Hopkins</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1528">One was a very nice gentleman at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">U-Uppsala</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , called Lars Terenius, and my <span class="INT_SPACE">lab</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1530">ANSWER:  And a little bit better than a year later, maybe two years later — yeah, that was in °73, a group in <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> , but also a German Jewish refugee, Hans Kosterlitz and his [indecipherable] John Hughes discovered the endorphins, the substance in the brain for which th-the receptors were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">They were not there for people who shoot up heroin, or take morphine for pain; they were there for the su-substance which we call er — endorphins.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1540">QUESTION:  That would be not bad at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1541">ANSWER:  At any rate, and that — well we — we did a great deal of work on what’s called signal transduction, which means what happens between the time these drugs, or the endorphins, bind to the receptors 1n the time the drug is abused or euphoria happens, a high happens, or pain is relieved.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1542">QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1543">ANSWER:  And while we still don’t know the whole story, we know a great deal of what some of the biochemical steps are between the binding of these drugs, or the endorphins and subsequent events.</span></p>
