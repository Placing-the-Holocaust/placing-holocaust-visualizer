</span><span class="sentence" id="1036">On the last night, when — when they were taking out all the people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> , it was Willie, and his friend Karl, and probably contacts that he had, which allowed him to bring approximately a hundred — hundred people — hundred young men from — from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> out into our end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">And so they avoided being th-th-they — th-they remained alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">So yeah, her brother could have been — her brother survived this particular person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">But so — an-and then there was a dispute with those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">What hundred people, what are you sa — talking about?

<p><span class="sentence" id="1072">ANSWER:  I-I — I was there when — when they took them, but this 1s the — this is the night that they brought the almost hundred boys into — into the <span

class="sentence" id="1075">My children, I protected them as much as I could, especially since I lost her — their mother at the age of nine and 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">This is my daughter, she was nine when my — when my wife has died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">So, the number — I said this is a telephone number, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">Til today they don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">Part of the fact that the family is meeting together here and I am giving the testimony and will try also to leave the testimony for my family out there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">This is the same, this — thi-this is part why we are here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">But just an aside, that it’s good for the children to know rather to not know, because they — they know anyhow, but in some dark and untouchable way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">What — what happened — RG-50.030*0580 78 what happened later on, I was lucky again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">There was a — they were supposed to — to e-empty the Zigeunerlager, and I don’t know — I don’t know

out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Later they were — they were all going from some — on some assignment to work, hopefully. </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">I gave him back the diamond and he accepted it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">And — so the idea is, if I could, somebody was in the krankenbau, in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , I will bring in a metal container, food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">But at one time the guard shot down the <span class="DLF">line</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">I — I was startled, and I

id="1101">Whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">It — it’s — it’s probably RG-50.030*0580 79 misconception with some people that it was dog eat dog and only dog eat dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">It wasn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">People were doing things when they could. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">I did too. </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">It was almost something pushing me do something good, since, you know, like — so — so this was the time, and — but I don’t understand why Willie was so nice to me, after — after trying to —
