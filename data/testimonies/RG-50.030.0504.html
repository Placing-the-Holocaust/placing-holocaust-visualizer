<p><span class="sentence" id="482">ANSWER:  And, you know, in my mind as a child, I was looking forward to this big trip we’re going to take someplace, somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And some people started talking about going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> , being an international city, it -- you didn’t need any papers, any visas, or anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">All you needed was to get on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and get there. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">But it had a bad reputation, and people didn’t want to go there, including my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So one time after Crystal Night, we had friends over the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> for a dinner -- I don’t know if it was a Friday night dinner or not, but one person said, you know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I’m not sticking around her any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I’m going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="490">Second person said I’Il join you, my father said, I'll join you. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">If that wouldn’t have happened, we probably would have been stuck in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="492">By this time we had an affidavit from the United States and in my parent’s mind we’ll go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> for a year or two until our number gets called up and then we go to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> and in my parent’s mind we’ll go to Shanghai for a year or two until our number gets called up and then we go to the States.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="493">QUESTION:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">ANSWER:  And that’s how we eventually ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> .</span></p>

<p>QUESTION:  -- that this was a strange <span class="NPIP">place</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  It’s a strange <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you know, I looked it up on an atlas where it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">In the meantime, my -- a couple of my uncles her -- moo -- moved to <span class="COUNTRY">Panama</span> , and I followed on the atlas where they went, you know, we all -- all the trips of course were by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , it wasn’t by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="499">So he stopped at many different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="500">And I was looking forward to this adventure. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">So we decided to go on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch liner</span> instead of a German or Italian like most people did. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">The advantage on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch liner</span> is that the so-called board money, you could take right out. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">The Germans allowed you x number of dollars, or marks, of course, to take on board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , to spend on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , but not to take off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="504">So when you went on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German liner</span> , they strictly adhere to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Dutch liner</span> that we went to, the purser said to my father, well didn’t you lose x number of dollars gambling last night? </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Didn’t you buy a box of cigars? </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And all that was written down and two days after we left Europe, he had all his money in his pocket.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="512">QUESTION:  Yeah?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="513">ANSWER:  To get all your heavy stuff on, you got from the freight company something they called a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">lift</span> , which was like a big box, size of a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> <span class="BUILDING">freight company</span> something they called a lift, which was like a big box, size of a room, and everything gets put in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And when you were packing that, somebody from the Gestapo was there watching what you were packing. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Well, when they came to do this packing, my mother sent me <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And I had some play money, which was back from the German inflation in the 20’s, had absolutely no value. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And she was getting ready to pack that, and the guy from the Gestapo was -- put up a fuss, you can’t take that. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And she was arguing, that’s my kid’s play money, it has no value. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">I don’t know for sure any more whether we left -- let him keep it or not, but I told my mother, “Let him have it, I don’t care.” </span><span class="sentence" id="520">You know, it’s just play money.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="527">ANSWER:  They were actually a little nasty at the beginning and then my mother gave them a drink, and they calmed down a bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And some of the little knickknacks that we had, she gave one person this and one person that. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">It wasn’t really bribery in any sense, but it softens them up in a way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="530">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="531">ANSWER:  And my parents also had the idea that maybe we can get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> somewhere before we get to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="532">I mean, <span class="COUNTRY">India</span> was still part of <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , the <span class="COUNTRY">Philippines</span> was part of the United States, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Singapore</span> was part of <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , Singapore was part of Britain. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">We thought we could maybe get off there.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">ANSWER:  So they decided that this lift with all our belongings should be kept by the freight company until they got the word from us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Instead of going on the shi --</p>
<p>ANSWER:  Instead -- instead of being shipped at the same time as we were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="538">QUESTION:  Right, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="539">ANSWER:  I mean, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> we were on was a passenger ship, it wasn’t a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freighter</span> , and the lift would have to go on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freighter</span> <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passenger ship</span> , it wasn’t a freighter, and the lift would have to go on a freighter. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">The -- obviously we didn't get off anyplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">Ended up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> and then contacted the freight company, she -- send it to us, this is our address. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">But in the meantime it’s July of 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">By the time this lift gets onto a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">freighter</span> 1t’s September, and the war breaks out. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">And all <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German ships</span> get the signal, go into a <span class="DLF">neutral port</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="545">The Dutch is -- East Indies, which are now <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> , were still neutral, so the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> ran into a neutral port in Dutch East Indies, and we had to pay a fair amount of money to get it from there to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> <span class="REGION">East Indies</span> , which are now Indonesia, were still neutral, so the ship ran into a <span class="DLF">neutral port</span> in <span class="REGION">Dutch East Indies</span> , and we had to pay a fair amount of money to get it from there to Shanghai.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="546">QUESTION:  Get it to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Shanghai</span> .</span></p>
