</span><span class="sentence" id="92">And they...they let us hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I don't know how she arranged it. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Only me. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And...and there was a few other kids from other employers who worked there hiding in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> up...uh...on the...and we used to look downstairs through the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and see the officer...the Nazi walking down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and looking, checking who is the...the workers and the Jews...looking for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And I was hiding upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Uh...There was never enough food so we just...most of the food I remember we ate is bread and water and I don't remember if we had anything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Uh...My mother...uh...always was hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Then they...I remember...was trying to hide me. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">At that time only my...uh.. cousins been left. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My cousin...my mother's...my mother's sister...the one who was killed had three children been left, and my mother was trying to take care on them also. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">Uh...Then...uh...I remember my...that Polish policeman came one evening and he said that they're going to close the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">They're going to send all the Jews away and to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> and they're going to...uh...or kill them or they're closing the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And he wanted my mother to come to...he said she can come to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and he will hide her. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And...uh...my mother would not come by herself because ...uh...she said she wanted to take me and also the other...uh...my cousin...my cousins who were in there. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And he would not agree. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">The only he agree finally is to take me. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So she didn't have a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">At night she sneaked me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And...uh...I don't know what arrangements she made with the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">My cousins were older than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Two of them been twins and they must have been 15 or 16 at that time, and they had a little sister was about maybe a year younger or a few months younger than I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So she made some kind of arrangements with somebody else to watch over them and they...uh...stayed and we sneaked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">She took, I remember, some blankets and clothes she had and we carried it to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And we sneaked into his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and just a few...maybe a week or so we stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and

girls and he wouldn't let them in. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And we been sitting in back and crying but he wouldn't let them in because it was too dangerous for him also to keep any Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">If they would've caught him, they would've killed him and all his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">The reason why he decided, I understand, to keep us 1s because...uh...he was sick and he had cancer and he knew he 1s going to die soon and he wanted to do something good before he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">He said he did so many bad things already and he...he was religious Catholic, Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And he knew my family and he must have liked my mother and he...uh...decided to save us though his family, his wife and his children didn't...was...was against it. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">They been afraid that they be caught and killed, but he made them so he didn't...uh...so he made his children...he sent to his brother in the...another...1n a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> next to there. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">And the only one stayed was his wife and his older daughter in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And the...after...uh...awhile we...he was hiding us first in a potato...uh...<span class="BUILDING">bunker</span> where they kept potatoes for the winter in the...uh...uh...next to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and it was very uncomfortable. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">It was dark there, and it was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And I don't remember how long we stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We must have stayed there about 2..2 or 3 months because it was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">And the winter start...started coming and...uh...so he decided to transfer us to...he had a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> ...a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> next to him where he kept...uh...chickens. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">He had a little...like a chicken...uh..<span class="BUILDING">house</span> and also he had wood there for the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">It was a <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">It

of us every day and a bottle of water. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">Once in a blue moon for a special occasion he would bring a little soup and...uh...sometimes if...1f he had to go away on business where they send him to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> for a day or some other he would...his wife or his daughter will never give us anything so we starved for a day or two until he came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And my mother and I been in that...uh...uh... <span class="BUILDING">shack</span> for... At night sometimes, my mother used to sneak out to clean out the pot and...uh...I never went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Uh...She wouldn't let me out, and I was afraid too. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">She was...uh...we didn't have anything to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I didn't have anything to play. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I was at that time 6 years old, and I didn't know...I used to play with the chickens and play with the straws on the. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">There was a lot of straw on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and he...he put up the...uh...a kind of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">mattress</span> or something where we slept in a corner with blankets and that was where we stayed and I used to play with the wood and I used to look out through those little <span class="DLF">holes</span> in the...through the...uh...shack and see some people...uh...walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Uh...Also, where he lived was at the edge of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there was a <span class="REGION">German section</span> there where the Germans lived not too far and there was <span class="DLF">farms</span> in back there. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So...uh...because he was a policeman and he lived closed to the German section, the police...the Germans never came to his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> to look for...uh...for any Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">So that way we uh...there was...we survived it. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Nobody came to check on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Uh...It was...uh...I remember the winters we were very cold and a few times my legs almost froze, and I slept with all my clothes and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">I don't remember how we washed or anything because I...he used to bring one bottle of water and I don't remember if he gave us any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Maybe sometime a bucket. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">I don't...

Everybody right away knew that I'm Jewish because I was walking so funny and looking so strange on everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I wasn't...uh...cause I didn't see people close to
