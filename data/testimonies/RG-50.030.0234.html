<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">So first of all, the first terrible blow that we got to to burst out of the children, orphans, on the the Lithuanians, but on the third day of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on the 18th of August...15th of August the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed...nobody comes in, nobody goes out...and the 18th of Aug...and they used everyday used to send workers to to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , to various <span class="NPIP">places</span> outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">This was hard work, very hard work that Jews were not used to do, for instance in <span class="BUILDING">building</span> ...brick... laying bricks or in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> to to the the the <span class="INT_SPACE">men's rooms</span> and the the other cleaning dirty things, so they said they need five hundred workers of academic (ph) professions for archives work, so people were so enthusiastic about this opportunity. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Instead of going and cleaning the <span class="INT_SPACE">lavatories</span> and and and to build the <span class="DLF">roads</span> and so on, so there appears five hundred thirty-four, and they took them out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they killed them in the very same day. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And when Lithuanians who could see from around the <span class="BUILDING">fort</span> ...fortress, they there were...the next day came Jewish workers nearby and had to walk to the and they showed them...they the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">We didn't believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">We couldn't believe how can...how can five hundred thirty-four innocent men, reputable then...lawyers, engineers, chemistries, uh physicians...why should they be killed without trial, without interrogation. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">We couldn't believe it because this was on the third of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">And then Dr. Elkes tried to go from one to the other, from one to the other, the dignitaries and not the dignitaries, and the civil...and the civil uh authority and then in the in the in the police...
QUESTION:  What was he doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="354">Was he trying to find out what happened or why?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="355">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">He said I'm the chairman of the Jewish committee and the overjuden. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">He spoke in their language and I am responsible for these Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I have to give areply. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">II I...please tell me why didn't they come. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">When will they come? </span><span class="sentence" id="361">Where are they now? </span><span class="sentence" id="362">What are they doing, you see? </span><span class="sentence" id="363">He didn't speak in this tone like I'm talking now, but he...he found always the right expression...first of all not to to hurt their Nazi dignity, and second to force them to to to to answer him first of all, to answer him, and to answer him in a way like a human being, because a Jew is not a human being. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">You understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="365">So they...first of all a Jew doesn't deserve that he he should get an answer at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">But Dr. Elkes put it in a way and the...he just told them of his uh relationship with the German ambassador. . </span><span class="sentence" id="367">It worked some...sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">Much...not much...uh but nevertheless, but he iS a Very...1S a...was a most courageous man and he always said nothing can happen to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">My sixty-four...five years are behind me and he always kept 1n his small pocket a poison and he said if worse comes to worse, he will...he will not fall in their hands alive and uh and he...and he asked which was very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Nobody, no insurance company in the world would give insurance for the life of Dr. Elkes. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">Because every small...not don't speak about the the commisar or the deputy sd commiisar who was responsible for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was himself a murderer, so a murderer...the the first ruler of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from the civil authority was the deputy ~—s commisar of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> by the name of Jordan (ph), and why the ...he write his name Jordan, but he was just a terrible guy.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="374">ANSWER:  Terrible...a mass murderer. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">He...for instance, he used to come in into the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish committee

his superiors be...because ...not because he was too harsh towards Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Towards Jews you cannot be harsh enough because the the final solution is the final solution of every Jew, but he took over certain functions that wasn't in in the in the priority...in the in the authority of his superiors... , So they sent him to the to the front and he was killed there, you see, and so it turned out that these five hundred and thirty-four, they had to admit to Dr. Elkes finally that they were killed by the thirty-four that sabotaged the Jews too. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">They were supposed to...1n in a in a store of sugar, they poured in gas...gasoline, and so this was why they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Of course,

class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">They never wanted to know what activities the mass murderers had enforced. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">It was my inner impulse, a driving...inner driving force to put it in writing because I was myself overwhelmed. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">I couldn't talk to anybody about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">There was not a possibility to talk because there was so taken the day to day and hour to hour with work in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> and I I

QUESTION:  Avraham, what I would like to start with is for you to tell us what were some of the the private ways that people decide the Nazi regulations and the Nazi laws in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="748">ANSWER:  Well, we usually read and hear about the heroic uprising of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw ghetto</span> , of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz ghetto</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">Also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , the uh the escape from the <span class="BUILDING">9th Fortress</span> , the legendary escape from the <span class="BUILDING">9th Fortress</span> that you read later , SO I uh but the main...I always am trying to stress and this is what I've done in my diary I think, to stress the fight of the each individual, of the inmate, the plain man or woman in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , even the the boy...child...for survival of one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">Sometimes survival of another hour in the hope that something might happen.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="751">QUESTION:  And what did they do when you...?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="752">ANSWER:  So first of all, the rations that the Germans gave to feed the inmates was a ration for starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">No one could live on a hundred grams, but also this hundred grams of bread, the uh the inmates didn't...the the the individual inmate didn't get because we had kept secret two thousand souls in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">Babies that had been born despite the the strict order to cut off pregnancies. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">Second there were old men or sick men that if you would put them on the register of the in...inmates of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they would have been killed, so this two thousand...approximately two thousand had to be...to get food, so we cut off from the general portion that we got uh so everyone got only approximately eighty grams or eighty-five grams of bread so that the others can get also. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">So each one in his own way tried to get additional food. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">You couldn't go in in the <span class="BUILDING">supermarket</span> and buy it. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">You couldn't go in because in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> there was nothing, so people used to go to the...to work <span class="NPIP">outside</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there try to get out for ten or fifteen minutes and buy and buy...not buy because nobody sold. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">It's war time and it were sanctions also in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> but the Lithuanians had enough food but they wanted always to trade in. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">They would give you a loaf of bread or half a loaf of bread for a pair of trousers or stockings or a jacket or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">I...for reason I remember it was the 31st of December, 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="762">My present wife sold out...already sold out everything she got, but she...there was left a gown, you know, for the ball, for very festivity...made big festivities. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">She was a rich woman, so...but nobody bought a gown in in in time of war, so we had in the <span class="BUILDING">opera house</span> in 1n in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kovno</span> , there were a group of Jewish workers who worked then in the <span class="BUILDING">opera house</span> as dressmakers, as uh as to make the haircuts and uh you know, __, and they were also working and cleaning the the <span class="BUILDING">opera house</span> so I took Pnina and went as workers in that brigade and she took along with her the gown. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">It was a wonderful gown, you know, and with the...accordingly also a pair of shoes, you know...elegant, and there on the 31st of the...before...the eve of the New Year, the actresses there jumped on this merchandise, you see, and so she she got some bread and and a little bit of uh of uh sugar, you see, for the gown, which costed hundreds and hundreds. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">Just in one of the examples of one fought for the survival of another day, more so when she had a small child and she needed...badly needed milk that you couldn't get in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , leave alone an egg, you see, so this was an opportunity for her to bring milk and then when she got it all and she got rid of her gown and this, it was a problem how to pass the control at the <span class="DLF">ghetto gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">When...at the <span class="DLF">ghetto gate</span> there always sentries of the ghetto commandant, the German ghetto commandant, then all the Lithuanians on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="767">From <span class="NPIP">inside</span> there were the uh employees of the Jewish labor exchange who used to to arrange the exit of the laborers in the groups from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> out to <span class="NPIP">outside</span> to their places of work and they were...had ways and means to bribe certain sent...sentry or the Lithuanian or the German, and so they keep uh close... close an eye and and they pass by, take part of 1t and give them as bribe you see, but nevertheless something left, and in this way people tried...tried not to starve, just plainly...very plain words...not to starve. </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And uh some some others used to to get a...make this deal of trade in above or through the <span class="DLF">ghetto fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="769">There was a <span class="DLF">barbed wire fence</span> , two meters high. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">The Lithuanians knew that there is a shortage of food inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so they used to come and from a from a distance show a loaf of bread or show a a sugar or show five eggs, you see, and the and the...from inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> they used to show a pair of trousers or a jacket or something like that, and when they...when they nod of the of the of the head, they came to to an agreement or they trade in, so when the...along...along the barbed wire always twenty-four hours a day, the sentry used to go back and forth, back and forth, so the moment when the sentry used to go, let's say to the left, they used to throw above...above the the uh <span class="DLF">fence</span> to the Lithuanians and they used

<p><span class="sentence" id="796">ANSWER:  Oh yes...well, you see, so uh fortunately... unfortunately from the beginning we were not...we were not conscious of the great danger of these children because we never thought that they can take children and kill them, but when the the aktion of the 4th of October, 1941, when they put on fire the contagious <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with the patients inside, with the uh doctors and with the personnel, medical personnel, all of the them, they were put on fire and they lead...but before they put on fire this <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , the adjacent <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was a <span class="BUILDING">children's home</span> , an <span class="BUILDING">orphan's home</span> , and there were approximately five, six hundred children so they took them out from the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in the broad...in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> of the...of the <span class="BUILDING">contagious diseases hospital</span> and were just plain put them...I can never forget the picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">There were small children and babies, just babies, in the in the <span class="BUILDING">orphan's homes</span> so the Germans when they put them on the on the on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and they just kicked them from one <span class="NPIP">side</span> to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> with their with their boots, the Gestapo men. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">People like beasts. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">They behaved just like beef...beasts. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">They used to kick them...when the children laid, for instance, with their faces up to to <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> , yes, so they kicked them, then turned down, and then again. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">This was a just terrible, terrible, terrible sight to see it and then they took them from that <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> straight to the <span class="BUILDING">9th Fortress</span> and they killed them in the very same day together with another thousand uh inmates of the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , after they put on fire the the the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="802">They did not let...our firemen were very...were the fire brigade in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ...excellent fire...firemen were trained years and they were ready to to to...but they didn't let them come near to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">There were Lithuanian fire brigades who came close to the close to the uh <span class="DLF">ghetto fence</span> , but they came just to safeguard that the fire shouldn't come over to the other side of the of the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="804">You understand? </span><span class="sentence" id="805">And this is...so you see they were just not to to to fight the fire but to see that the fire shouldn't grow to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> and uh this was one of the most tragic days and what...it is worthwhile mentioning, in that very <span class="BUILDING">contagious diseases hospital</span> , you see, we were...we didn't have so much <span class="INT_SPACE">space</span> and so many <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> , so part of this <span class="BUILDING">contagious diseases hospital</span> served as a maternity where children...women gave birth to to children. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">This, of course, was absolutely against...contrary to the to the restrictions of of pregnancy and so on, so when they took out the uh the uh the uh the uh...they took out from their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> many sick people and they brought them in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they couldn't __ for sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">They shouldn't remain sometimes in _. _</span><span class="sentence" id="808">There was left some part of the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , left after the —_, so in one...they they left...they didn't...they just pass by one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where two women were laying after giving birth to the child, to the babies, and the two babies were on, you know, on the <span class="DLF">window</span> there 1s a...big <span class="DLF">window</span> there is such a...you know, like let's say this is the <span class="DLF">window</span> and here is such a small...a small wooden...wooden...

<p><span class="sentence" id="816">ANSWER:  Well...so so at that time...at that time, when they liquidated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , they took thousand men from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they liquidated to the <span class="BUILDING">9th Fortress</span> , so I didn't have any ——_—smorre in '42...1t was...in '41 in the beginning I have to say prior to the aktions on on human beings, on life, they took...confiscated all the belongings and they were...when the ghetto inmates were ordered under threat of death to give all their gold, their belongings, their silver, furs, __, post stamps, collections...whatever valuables, and there were two <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> in the in the...near the Jewish committee where the Jews had to bring bring all their belongings and wherever they...while making the searches inside the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , each other, and sometimes on the spot killing them and and this brought about the people to run and get rid of their gold, to get rid of their silver, to get rid of their of their of their furs, you see, so we didn't have any cameras anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">If...1n...on the __...1t was in August. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">The the big...the big confiscation, the total confiscation of whatever people had had with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">Others digged it in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> or somewhere and they didn't...like Mack (ph)...I'll think about them later, but the the overwhelming majority, they were left without a penny and without any valuable, clothing or or furs or whatever it was, so I didn't have a camera anymore, and I thought it is absolutely possible...impossible that this event, that this <span class="NPIP">side</span> should not be somehow eternalized for posterity, but this already...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was out of bounds. </span><span class="sentence" id="820">It was cut off from from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="821">I'm sorry I didn't take along with me my documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">I would have shown you. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">Sol went toto Esther ——_—s, and I told her, Esther, you must draw what remained from the burned <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , so she said how can we come in. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">It is it is out of bounds, so I I went to the commandant of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I told him that since it was it was October...in in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> in October it is already cold and very cold and we had no firewood in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and what they used to give us, just like the hundred grams of bread, this was the same story with the with the firewood, so I told them in the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , some families left some firewood. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">Would he allow us to take out from this from these <span class="BUILDING">dwellings</span> inside the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , to take out the firewood?
