<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER:  My name is Regina Gelb, born Laks, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , December 16th, 1929.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">QUESTION:  And you can look at me, rather than right into the lens? </span><span class="sentence" id="2">Okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  Uh-huh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  We're really going to start where you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">You said you didn't have any particular vivid memories of when you first arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  Well, you wanted to talk about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I will just add perhaps, I arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  I am the youngest of three sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">My older sister Anna’, my second sister Chris, and I were in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> coming from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> , while our father was in an adjacent <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with the men, also out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Mother was no longer with us, because she was taken away two years prior while the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> , was being cleared of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">When we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , our basic existence consisted of practically the same route so to say, as those other people who had arrived from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Namely, we were tattooed right at the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">We were fortunate enough to stand in <span class="DLF">line</span> so as to get consecutive numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">My older sister received the first, my middle sister the next, and I received the third. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">Because we then realized, that if we are to be given numbers, we will probably be referred to as numbers from now on. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And every time a number is called, we might be lucky to have it called in sequence and remain together. </span><span class="sentence" id="17"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> basically was the same as I said for the women, the same experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">We were in quarantine for a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">We were doing work that was no work. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">It was just carrying a rock from one end of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to the next, and back, just in order to exhaust us. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">The food was awful, it was meager. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">We stood on roll call. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">All the things that were happening to the Starachowice group of women was happening to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">In October 1942, October 27th to be precise, there was a general round up of everybody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The Germans came around knocking heavily on the <span class="DLF">doors</span> , “alle raus’,” and we were supposed to go to the square. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Mother was in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at the time with my father and I. My two older sisters were not in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> at the time, because they secured a job in one of the <span class="BUILDING">brick factories</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And they were working on the night shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Therefore they were kept over. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Nobody was let out of the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> for the selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">Only people ' Anna Wilson ; Everybody out (German) who remained in the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were chased out. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I remember that I was a very, very skinny kid, and tall, but very slim. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And my mother made me — she made me heavier, and she put breasts on me out of some rags, and she gave me rouge to make me look older and more mature. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And I remember we did put on more clothing then necessary, even though that was — that was October, and it was still rather warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Because we really didn't know where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">And when we came — we were driven, there were already a lot of auxiliary German police, and the Latvians — who were helping out, and the Ukrainians — who were helping out at that particular time of the round up. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And I do remember seeing horrible things on the way to the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> where the selection was to take place. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">They would grab children, and smash them against <span class="DLF">walls</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And people who couldn't move fast enough were beaten mercilessly. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And when we finally reached the <span class="BUILDING">market place</span> where the selection was to begin, my mother noticed a lady who was an older lady, who was — she was very friendly with. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And she was sort of helping her out. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">The lady's name was Kazimierska, Mrs. Kazimierska. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And she was elderly, and couldn't walk too well, and mother took her by the arm and stood with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">My father of course was pointed to the group where the men were. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">And I was pointed — I was near my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">But mother was pointed with Mrs. Kazimierska 1n this other group, and I was pointed in another group. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Obviously, I had no idea who was in which group. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">Soon enough we were put in a formation, and made to walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">And we walked -- I was of course walking with the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">And we came to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica</span> , that was within the premises of the <span class="REGION">Starachowice area</span> , where the Nazis were establishing a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">work camp</span> for slave labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">Because in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">munitions factory</span> run by the Germans for which they needed forced labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">When we arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica</span> , in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Strzelnica</span> I soon discovered that mother was not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Only father was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Because we were grouped men and women separately. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I had no idea where my two sisters were, but I did know that if they are "gainfully," quote unquote, "occupied", they would be saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Well, we subsequently found out — and when I mean subsequently, I mean many years later after the war — that the selection that took place in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> was destined for <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> , and that is where my mother perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Very soon my two sisters were sent to another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> within the <span class="REGION">Starachowice area</span> , and that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And now, the Nazis were running two separate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="58">One was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka</span> , and one was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strzelnica</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Most people were employed in the <span class="BUILDING">munitions factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The highest echelon of the camp were the Germans, and everybody else taking care of us were the Ukrainians. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They were the guards, they were the people who conducted the <span class="BUILDING">convoys</span> going to work, and from work. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And they were brutal, absolutely brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Well, I don't quite remember how long the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp Strzelnica</span> existed. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">I do know that the typhus — a terrible typhus epidemic broke out, that I had typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">But I do remember subsequently these two <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were joined. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">And this is where I got reunited with my two sisters and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And from that point on, until late in July of 1944, where the entire single <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Majowka camp</span> was resettled in a smaller <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> which was adjacent to a <span class="DLF">railroad track</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">We were together, meaning the women, on the <span class="REGION">women's side</span> , but we were able to see our father. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And personally, I was terribly dependent on my sisters, because I absolutely and truly had no initiative and I had no idea of how to behave in those circumstances, or what to behave. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I truly gave myself up to their care, and they became my surrogate mother in really more than one way. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">From that last <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which did not really last too long, we were loaded on to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that were brought there and shipped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="72">We arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> on that <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">It was either the end of July, or very early August of 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">As we were being unloaded we realized when we stood on the <span class="DLF">platform</span> , our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was adjacent to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">men's train</span> in which my father was. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">And we still saw our father on that <span class="DLF">railroad platform</span> and he saw us. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And that was as I said, probably the beginning of August. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">We never saw our father again after that. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And we found out after the war from people — we never saw our father again after that. [</span><span class="sentence" id="79">Pause in proceedings |
QUESTION:  Can you go back a couple sentences? </span><span class="sentence" id="80">You got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="81">ANSWER:  We got off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> happened to be adjacent to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> in which the men traveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">So, when we were discharged from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> onto the <span class="DLF">platform</span> , we did notice our father in that group of men who descended from the adjacent <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and that was the last time we saw our father. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">He was taken into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with the men, we went with the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">And after the war we found out that father totally lost his — you have to answer?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  Just wait.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  It's all in a days work. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I'm sorry. [</span><span class="sentence" id="88">Technical conversation |
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Let's just go from what you learned about your father after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">What happened to him? [</span><span class="sentence" id="91">Technical conversation |
QUESTION:  You remember the tapes of the apple?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="92">ANSWER:  You know the most amazing thing to me 1s, I am very particular about cleanliness of food. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">I don't even eat in <span class="BUILDING">restaurants</span> , unless I come in and smell the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and look it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">And of course the apple, that was the apple — I hadn't seen an apple I'm sure for a few years. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">And this was the absolute find. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And I always say to myself, “How was it that I ate that core, that leftover core without thinking: Who ate it? </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Who threw it away? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">Who spat on it? </span><span class="sentence" id="99">What dog made on it?”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">QUESTION:  It’s called “starvation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">ANSWER:  Yes, well— [Pause in proceedings |
ANSWER:  The job for which we were picked was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brzezinka</span> within the confines of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in a self-contained unit called Effektenkammer’. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">That unit consisted of a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , which kept in very specifically assigned bags, numbered bags, the personal belongings of the political prisoners — non-Jewish, political prisoners — who were imprisoned in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">We were to guard it with our lives almost, because there wasn't ever anything to be missed, or mislaid. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">There was to be no pin transferred from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Those were bags that were hung up on racks with numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">And whenever a political prisoner perished, his personal belongings were packed 1n a box. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">We were taught how to package it, and mail it out. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">This job was absolutely a godsend. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">In the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , we were a totally self contained unit, separated from everything else by barbed wire. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">We lived indoors and worked indoors. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">We did not have to go to the <span class="DLF">marshes</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">We had a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> that cooked whatever meager provisions there were, but at least 1t wasn't the same kind of starvation diet that was prevailing at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> proper. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And the unit was run basically by Polish women, Christian women. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And apparently the 30 women who were dismissed from this job, who were replaced, because there was some contact with them and the Polish underground. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So actually, somebody's misfortune turned out to be our great, great fortune, because for the duration of the stay in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> — we're now talking about November or December, very bitter cold — we were spared going to the <span class="DLF">marshes</span> and standing in the cold water. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And meanwhile of course, January rolled around, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was being evacuated, and we with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Luckily enough, we were dressed not 1n rags, but we had clothing on us that could keep us warm. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And we were then driven on a march toward <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , that were somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">There were <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> somewhere, but I really don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Because at that point much as I was trying to be very independent, not to be a burden to my sisters, I always knew they were really looking out for my benefit. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But right here, I just could not overcome my physical person. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Meaning we were marched without stopping, and without sleeping, in the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">And I completely and totally separated myself in sleep, from the reality, the prevailing reality, the march. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And my sisters to this day tell me, and I know it for a fact, I never would * <span class="INT_SPACE">Personal effects chamber</span> (German); <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> for confiscated belongings of prisoners. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">have survived if they had not pulled me through that march. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">I think that lasted for almost a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">It was day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And I remembered the hallucination, that is the only thing that I really remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">There was a white <span class="DLF">road</span> , and there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> on both ends, both sides of the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And it seemed to me like I was in an <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> , because it was white and dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And that I was in some kind of an <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> , that was a total fantasy. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">But I actually lived that fantasy. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And as a matter of fact, after a number of hours — I don't know how many — when we stopped, everybody was told to relieve themselves right where they stood. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And my sisters told me to relieve myself, and I absolutely couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Because you see I was in that other reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And it just did not — did not yet match up with my physical person. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So, that what actually happened was, as Chris my sister told me, I slept through that march. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And we would just fall by the wayside, and stop at <span class="BUILDING">barns</span> or whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Anyway, we finally reached that particular <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , or whatever it was, a <span class="DLF">siding</span> , I couldn't tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that we were loaded on were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> , but they were open. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I forgot the name, I think they are called <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal trains</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And they were sort of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">benches</span> on them or on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . [</span><span class="sentence" id="143">Telephone rings] [Technical conversation |
ANSWER:  And Chris was telling me it was like an overnight type of stop, and they found me. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And that I remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Well, the march from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in the middle of January or thereabouts, going west, which was the evacuation of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was a horrendous experience for me personally, I fell asleep during it. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And I survived only because I was pulled by my two sisters, who insisted that I walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">That I sit down when we're told to sit down. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Who directed my physical motions as needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Just so that I would make it through. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And actually I do remember the hallucinations that I had at that time, where reality was — the present reality was fiction, and my imaginary reality was the reality according to what which I acted. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Be that as it may, that was a horrendously difficult trip because of the winter snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">They were killing people right along the way if you did not march in <span class="DLF">line</span> , if you sat down for a minute. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">People just falling like flies. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And we finally made it, whether it was to a <span class="DLF">railroad siding</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> , I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">But there were these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  You got hit once, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">QUESTION:  What happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  I got hit once during the march when we were for the night somewhere or other, they were — we were chased into a huge <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , and everybody was supposed to get in and sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">At any rate, I didn't move fast enough, and I was hit right on the face — whether it was with the butt of the rifle, or with a shoe, or whatever it was — and I fell down, since I was asleep anyhow. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I just fell down, and I never moved. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And the next thing when I woke up, and the commotion started, I found myself at the very edge of that big <span class="DLF">enclosure</span> where as everybody else was <span class="NPIP">inside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="163">And I realized that I'm alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">And I had the presence of mind to pick myself up and stand at the <span class="DLF">door</span> , and see who was exiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And I found my two sisters that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And of course I imagined that perhaps my hallucinations lessened because of that short sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">However, we did make it to that string of open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> in which we were seated. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">And the fortunate thing that happened was, the snow started falling. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was open, we were covered with the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">And you know, in every misfortune, there is a good fortune. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">While it was cold, we were huddled with a mass of humanity, with women obviously. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">But we had moisture to drink. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">We would scrape the snow off the faces, and off the coats, and off the clothes, and eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And Chris even reminded me, that we took with us a bit of sugar from our last <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and we mixed the sugar together with the snow, and that sustained us until we arrived. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">We did not know where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">The <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> pulled up, we were all covered with snow, and there was this big sign that said <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrtick</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We never heard of it, at least I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">We were unloaded right there on to the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Not the <span class="DLF">platform</span> , but 1t was sort of a snow area, and there was no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And we were told to stay there right on the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">Apparently by that time, all the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> were being emptied, and people were being collected inside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrick</span> completely overflowing with humanity, for which they had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> for all these people that were coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">So, we were held in that <span class="REGION">area</span> which must have been some kind of grassy knoll, but this was now covered with snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And I do remember when we were finally taken into a <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> , when we left, the whole white <span class="REGION">area</span> was covered with feces and urine of course, because we sat there and people had to relieve themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">And we came into a huge <span class="BUILDING">tent</span> with free standing — free standing <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> to stay on. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It was absolutely the worst, most disorganized of all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German camps</span> that we have seen up to that point, because there was just too impossible to accommodate all that humanity. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrick</span> was absolute <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">There was no work to go to, there was just counting in and out, counting and sitting around, and being squashed by people. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Finally, they said that there might be transports going out. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And as I said before, I had very little to do with my own survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">But my sisters decided that whatever happened, “If there is a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , we've got to get on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Wherever it's going it doesn't matter, because nothing could be worse than this particular situation, which is beyond description.” </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And so, these <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> came up, and we got loaded on. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And I don't remember how long we drove, but I guess 1t was quite a number of hours because when we arrived we were unloaded in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and that name of the <span class="NPIP">place</span> was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Retzow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="195">And that was a totally empty <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp.</span> </span><span class="sentence" id="196">There was nobody there, and they took, I don't remember how many, it was not as big as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrick</span> , it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And because we were among the first to alight from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> we were lined up and we were given jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And the SS women who were supervising that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> these camp women had their own lodgings there. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We were lucky enough, I got a job as a maid for one of the SS women to clean her <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="200">My sister from <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , Anna, was assigned to an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , to clean an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And Chris, I forgot what kind of job she got. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">But she reminded me of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">That the woman for whom I cleaned her <span class="NPIP">place</span> — this German woman — took a liking to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">And she decided she was going to be good to me, and leave me the crust of her bread on a piece of paper because she wouldn't come near. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">She kept leaving it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and the crust of her bread on a piece of paper, because she wouldn't come near. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And she kept leaving it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> the crust of bread and going. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">And one day she asked me if I'm getting the crust of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And I said, “Yes, but I'm sharing it with my sister because she doesn't have a good job and could she get a job indoors?” </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And Chris was assigned to the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">And subsequently, because they were so unwilling to be mixing in with prisoners, they housed us underneath the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , so that we would not be mixed with the population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , however big or small it was, for the reason that we wouldn't be bringing lice, or whatever, we would be clean to serve them. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">And this is now April. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">And I distinctly remember that I found out that President Roosevelt died. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">Truly, I just knew that President Roosevelt was some great, wonderful president somewhere in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">But somehow one of the prisoners heard on a radio or whatever it was, that president Roosevelt died, so I think he died in early April. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">Soon after, the bombing started, the allies were bombing that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Retzow camp</span> , because this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> was basically located near some kind of an <span class="DLF">airfield</span> , or Air Force whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">And the women who were brought after us in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> that followed were assigned to digging ditches for anti-aircraft, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">And so it happened that the bombs were falling ever more thicker, and all of a sudden we were told to pack up for the German women, because we were going to leave this camp. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Not knowing which way or however. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">But we had to line up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Again in formation, except that this time those of us who worked as maids had to carry the belongings of the SS women, because they were also evacuating. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And I remember distinctly, we walked not very long, until we got to a big <span class="DLF">highway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="222">And there was this most incredible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">First of all we were handed rations of food from the Red Cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">It was — we don't know how, there was Swedish Red Cross was handing out rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And these German women were grabbing all the cigarettes, and grabbed all the cigarettes and packed them in their own bags. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">But we had rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">I remember distinctly my first sardines came in a can in those rations. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">As soon as we found ourself on the main <span class="DLF">highway</span> , there was a totally new — a new situation for which we were not prepared. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Because we really did not know the progress of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">We were in the eye of the storm, but we never knew what was happening, of who was winning or losing the war, or how the war was progressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">We just knew the misery of people dying constantly. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">And we finally knew that President Roosevelt had died, but was neither here nor there. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Because that did not reflect on our personal reality. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">We found ourself on that <span class="DLF">highway</span> , which had civilians, it had cows, it had horses, it had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German tanks</span> , it had soldiers in uniform, out of formation. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">It had soldiers in uniform in formation. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">It had — it had Polish Christian workers who were working forced labor on <span class="DLF">German farms</span> during the war, who were also mixed into this mix. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And us walking with painted, heavily painted white “X's”. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">It was a white enamel type paint that they painted our clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">An “X”’ in the front, and an “X”’ in the back, right through my coat. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">In fact, I had the coat after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">And when we came back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I had it redone. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">It was fantastic material, but it had that horrible cross. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">But anyhow—
QUESTION:  What was the cross for? </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Was it to identify you as—
ANSWER:  AS a prisoner, yes. [</span><span class="sentence" id="245">Technical conversation |
QUESTION:  Did you get anything to eat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrtick</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="246">Was there food there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  Oh, practically nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Practically nothing, because it was totally disorganized, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">You didn't eat in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , but you had that water, or watery coffee, or whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">QUESTION:  You Just told me — I'm sorry, you were saying in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> at least what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">ANSWER:  Well, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> though the food was meager, less than meager, it was doled out with a system. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">In other words, whatever watery coffee you got in the morning, it was there at all times. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And the same whatever, horrible stuff they gave you that was soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">It was not soup, it was sand and some piece of turnip for a caldron of soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">That was at least what you expected to get, and you got. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> , because of the total inhuman influx of people for which they were not prepared, or perhaps they didn't want to plan, or as I said, I did not know the realities of the war to account for that. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">It was just total <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , disorganized <span class="NPIP">hell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">This 1s why we really volunteered for that trip to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Retzow</span> , which we didn't know where they was taking us. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Every selection was another selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">Every transport could have, as I said, ended in death. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">But we were desperate enough, and not so much my plans, but my sisters', they made the plans, and they decided “better out than in for staying.” </span><span class="sentence" id="262">So when we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Retzow</span> , we had these indoor jobs, and we didn't freeze anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And we sort of recouped our strength to the point again, where we are able to withstand whatever horror was going to come our way. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And when we were driven onto the <span class="DLF">road</span> when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> — the bombing increased, Allied bombs increased. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And of course maybe someday I'll tell you the reaction to bombing of people in our unit, where different people reacting to bombing all of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">One was washing herself all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">One was rubbing her hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Anyhow — but that is another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">That is sort of like a vignette that probably -.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="270">QUESTION:  No, tell us the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">ANSWER:  It's very interesting, because we lived under where we worked, where we served the German women. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">We lived under this <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> 1n sort of like a <span class="INT_SPACE">cellar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And every time the bombs started falling, and we somehow had a feeling that things are going to end very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And some people, some of the women were petrified, they won't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">One of them had an obsessive — completely obsessive kind of a behavior. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">She would grab a bucket of water, and she kept washing herself. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">It was absolutely unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">And whatever made her do it, and of course some people sat in corners and prayed, and some people sang. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Some people were singing songs. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Some people were having hysterics, because the bombs were So very, very near. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And I guess we were affected by it, never thinking that the Germans were probably more scared than we were, because we had by now gone through living <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , and this was just one more thing that was in the scheme of things, wasn't such a tremendous — you know, it's not a tremendous problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">It was only bombs, you know, from which you die either way. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">It isn't starvation, or death, or all this dirt and being eaten by lice and bedbugs. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">This is not the same category. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And indeed — they were indeed scared, because very, very soon after we were evacuated, and found ourselves on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Before that as I mentioned, we were given Swedish Red Cross rations, and we found ourselves on the <span class="DLF">road</span> with all that population, with the mix of humanity, of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , and cattle, and horses, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , and Germans, and Poles, and workers, and POWs, and us being marked with a white enamel cross on our clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">Not a cross, it was an “X” rather on both ends. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">Well, at one point the <span class="DLF">roads</span> were so packed, that the women who were guarding us said we have to sit down, because there is no way to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">We sat at the <span class="DLF">roadside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">And meanwhile, they got over to the side to talk with other SS women who were guarding other groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">And one of the women, of the girls who served as a maid as I did, who carried the rucksack for the German women said, "Hey, I speak German very well.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="292">She was blonde. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">I think she must have been 20 or 21. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">A mature girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">She said, "After all I am blonde, and I speak German very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Why couldn't I impersonate her?" </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And the group around her, we were 12 of us around her including her, decided, “Yes, in this madness of this mix, how could you tell, except that we had our clothes that was marked?” </span><span class="sentence" id="298">You see, if we were just in regular clothes, we could have mixed as the population, the civilian population. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">And she took out from the German woman's bag her cape. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And they used to wear like a garrison cap, you know, one of those German hats. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">She put that on, and she said, "You know what we're going to do, we're going to detach ourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I will be your guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">If we're found out, I will say we just got lost in this melee, and I was trying to protect these prisoners, and we just got stuff mixed up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="304">And we slowly slid down like it was like an <span class="DLF">embankment</span> , 12 of us with this Halina. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">Her name was Halina. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I have no idea what her last name was. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Perhaps I knew and forgot, but her name was Halina. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">She was a Polish Jewish girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">There were Russian girls, and Polish girls, because this was really such along way out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and out of all these selections, that the group was extremely mixed. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Anyhow, we slid down that <span class="DLF">embankment</span> , and went into the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="311">And anyway, the night came, so we decided to stay over and see what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Anyhow, next morning we got up, and we saw some men working in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> nearby. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And we were going that way, not knowing which way, east, west, south, or north. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">It was just away from that <span class="DLF">road</span> that was now still choked up with all that, and we didn't know where it was going, or what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">These men in the <span class="DLF">field</span> were — excuse me, Polish POWs, Christians who were working on the <span class="DLF">German farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And as soon as we got to them, they discovered that we speak Polish very well, and some of us were Polish Christians, and Polish Jews, and there was a mixture. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">And they said, “You know, there's a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , sort of like a little <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> up there. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">You go there, and tell this woman — there's a German woman, a servant — that we sent you and she had to feed you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And we came in, and sure enough the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was deserted by the owners. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">But there was this old woman, I don't know how old she was, but there was this woman — German servant — and she fed us. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And we were just absolutely beside ourself with the surprise of it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And it was this miracle. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Of course we didn't know what danger faced us. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Because we didn't know whether the war ended. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">This is now the end of April. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">We did not know, this is end of April, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Because we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Retzow</span> about two months. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">So, coming out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> in January, into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrick</span> for two weeks, into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Retzow</span> you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So, we are in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> about two weeks, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Retzow</span> for about two months, because now it was the end of April 1944.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="330">QUESTION:  '45?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="331">ANSWER:  Yes, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Excuse me, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">We had no idea what was really happening, except all of a sudden we noticed Russian uniforms around, and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And not in any victorious fashion as you would imagine sometime, “How am I going to be liberated? </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Will there be flags flying?” </span><span class="sentence" id="336">It wasn't anything like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">It was the melee of things, and people, and then these Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And the following day, or maybe two days later, they came up to that <span class="DLF">farm</span> — that was rather really like a <span class="BUILDING">villa</span> , 1t wasn't an ordinary <span class="DLF">farm</span> — and they said, “Oh, well that's great. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">Here's these women, and they speak Russian, and they speak Polish.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And they said, “We're going to be coming back in two days, you're going to work for us.”” </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Meanwhile, the word got around they were raping the women. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">The Russians girls told us. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And as soon as they left, we packed up and we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We left that so called “paradise.” </span><span class="sentence" id="345">We were finding out now that the war was coming to an end. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">But things were very disorderly, and nobody knew which end was up, and which way was — which way you should head. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">We sort of traveled with some of the original 12 women but we scattered, because not everyone had the same idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">We knew that our parents did not survive, but my mother came from a very large family. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">There were nine children, meaning with families — nine families. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And there was my father's big family, and we were hoping we could get back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> as fast as we can. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">We would at least be able to find people who survived, because my grandmother did not live in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">So that we decided to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">So, that the march started again, because we were way inside <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="354">I think rather very near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hamburg</span> is where <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Retzow</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="355"><span class="REGION">Northern Germany</span> , the <span class="REGION">area</span> generally known as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mecklenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">So that we had to make our way from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mecklenburg</span> back east to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="357">So we walked as far as a place that was than called in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schneidemuhl</span> , now it's called as <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pila</span> , 1t was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , now it's in <span class="REGION">Polish territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So, we were finally able to board a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> that was going east. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">We got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Two <span class="BUILDING">stations</span> later we were bumped off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , because soldiers were coming, and they had preference. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">So by the time we got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bydgoszcz</span> , we must have been in and out of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , waiting to be off one, and on one. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">And of course we had no idea where we were going. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">But as long as we were going east, it was in the direction of <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And we were planning on getting back, and see what was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">Soon, very soon, on one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> when we were finally seated on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , a gentlemen in uniform came over and he heard us speak Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">Whether he was a Polish Jew or Russian Jew, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">But he was Jewish, in uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">He said, “I overheard you talk, and say you're going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">I must tell you one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Where do you come from?” </span><span class="sentence" id="371">We said “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="372">He said, ““You must not go to back to any small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">You will not survive if you do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">What you have to do 1s go to any big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="375">You go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , or you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="376">And we said, “How we going to go to these <span class="NPIP">places</span> where we don't really know the <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and we certainly don't know who is going to be there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="377">He said, “This you must do.” </span><span class="sentence" id="378">But he said he had a sister that...

QUESTION:  Did any of you ask the man?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  Well, the man told us that it's dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">The situation is unsettled. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">This is now early May, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">The war was officially over. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">But things were in great flux because the armies were moving east and west, west and east. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And the population shifts during the war as you know, were such that there was just masses of humanity going from hither to yon and back. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Because people were resettled, and uprooted, and whatever else. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">So, he said that would be one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">Another thing, that small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> if you come back, and you might have been a person of means, and had property, that might get in your way. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">Because you would be suspected of coming to claim your property. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">If it was real property, or <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And we said, “What are we going to do? </span><span class="sentence" id="391">We don't know anybody.” </span><span class="sentence" id="392">He said “No, you will go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="393">If you want to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> , my sister lives there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="394">He said he had a sister, and he's going to give us her address. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">But basically now, the three big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">centers</span> had Jewish organizations registering people. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">And it was most important for us to put our name in those <span class="BUILDING">registries</span> , and go there and find out -- day after day -- to find out who else signed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">Because that was the way — you see the Red Cross was handling some of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">But the masses of uprooted humanity was such that the Jewish Agency’ set out its own — its own well <span class="BUILDING">bureau</span> , its own <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to register the returning Jews from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="399">We got to the <span class="BUILDING">sister's house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Sure enough, it was in the evening, her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was packed. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">People were there like herrings, laid out on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Because whoever came back ended up there, and we stayed in that <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> on the <span class="DLF">stairwell</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I remember, even Chris reminded me of it too. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">We talked about it, we laughed, because that was a real great welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">We had absolutely no idea where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And it was packed, but people said “Welcome, stay.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="407">And they pointed us in the right direction, the Jewish Agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I think it was the Joint Distribution Committee’, or whatever, the Jewish Agency, or international agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">We signed up, and we went. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">Everyday we were given rations, and you know, provisions to sustain ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">And whether we found it on our own, or they somehow assigned to us a <span class="DLF">hovel</span> , that was the most incredible <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="412">It was nothing, but it was a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over our heads. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">The <span class="DLF">walls</span> were falling in, and it was horrendous. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">However, we were very lucky to discover that Uncle Alexander survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Uncle Alexander was my father's brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">We came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> , and he came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="417">His name was Alexander Laks. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And Uncle Alexander came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> at the same time we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So, we were reunited with uncle Alexander, and we formed a <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="420">And soon enough Chana came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , and she joined us, and she was part of the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="421">She became the fourth sister, Chana Tencer, so we formed this provisional <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And we did not discover — we did not find anybody else coming back however, until Alexander's wife survived in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">She was taken by the Swedish Red Cross out of one of these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps,</span> because she was also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">So Uncle Alexander stayed with us, and went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Radom</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">He had property and he was able to secure some funds, and we lived with him, and started struggling, and finding jobs and such. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Subsequently in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="427">My sisters went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">They also went to — paid a visit to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> and came back very quickly, because they were threatened also that they were going to be killed if they stayed around. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">So, that really was the end of our connection to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="430">We stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="431">QUESTION:  Your Uncle Alexander was the only one of the nine brothers and sisters -
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Mother's family was not Laks, mother's family was Tenenblum(ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="433">My mother's family was a larger family. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">Uncle Alexander was my father's brother, and my father had two other sisters about whom we didn't know anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">One of the daughters of the sister survived in * Jewish Agency for <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> ; branch of the World Zionist Organization whose aim is to assist and encourage Jews to foster development and settlement of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="436">> American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee; Jewish American relief organization founded in 1914. </span><span class="sentence" id="437"><span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , her name is Andzia°. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">But my mother had a very big family and nobody survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And we did find out later she lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostrowiec</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And we found out from people that lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostrowiec</span> , that she taken when <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ostrowiec</span> was being cleared of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And my mother's youngest sister, the pharmacist who worked in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">Right before the war she got in a <span class="BUILDING">pharmacy</span> a job in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomza</span> after she graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">We never heard of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Nobody heard of her, because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lomza</span> was northeast, and that was somehow annexed to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="445">And then the Germans came, and the Russians came, and it was back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">And Lomza also had these Jews shipped out to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> , I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But we don't know whether this younger sister of my mothers ever survived the selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So, Uncle Alexander in our life at that point was the only surviving relative. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">When my sisters went back, as I said, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> they were threatened, and something terrible already had happened in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that same night when they were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Two women with children who returned from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , six and eight year old children, and two women — they were killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Starachowice</span> that same night my sister came. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And of course I did not go. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I stayed with Uncle Alexander in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And they went. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Of course they did not come back with anything except for some personal gifts that my mother's very dear, dear friend who kept a few mementos, who never even thought she should take things, you know, to hide for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">My two sisters went to her <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and she smuggled them out in the last minute onto the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">So that was the end of our going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">You know, you can't go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> again, in more ways than one. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And that was certainly brought <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to us at that point, and we stayed on in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , and we eventually went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and ended up in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">But again, I would like to add at this point, that I have mentioned it before. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Not that I was a coward as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">But I had nothing to do with my own survival you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">It was either chance, or 1t was my mother's wonderful wishes for her children to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">Or whether it was my sisters' efforts to keep us going, or whether it was the support we gave each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">However it was I survived, it was it was none of my doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">It was the, the merest chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">And the most miraculous thing of that, having survived all of that, I sort of made peace with my background in the sense that I have learned going through life that people have other horrible life experiences, people who have never suffered in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And because I was able to make a life for myself, and still be educated in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and still be a child in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , because I still went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">summer camp</span> here, I went to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="468">I went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I graduated from, from <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">I was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I was taught Polish at the <span class="BUILDING">University</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I married an, an American. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">I have a wonderful husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">We've been married for 38 years, and we have two grown sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was never oriented around anything that was part of my past, in the sense that I still have very close ties to my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And always my dearest friends are the oldest friends from these times. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I've never denied the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">I have never ever removed my numbers, though I was absolutely almost forced to remove it by some people I knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">And he was a plastic surgeon. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">In fact my first job in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was as a governess, for a family who went in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for — and he was a plastic surgeon, and he kept telling me, “I will not charge you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="481">° Andzia Ptasznik Of course those were my childhood days, and really, I was absolutely green about everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And he said, “I won't charge you. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I will do a beautiful job for you, and I remove your numbers.” </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And I said, “Absolutely not, because that is like brown eyes, is a part of my person, so is this number. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">It is an indelible thing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="486">I live with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">I don't regret not having removed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">I cannot say I'm proud of how I survived, or what I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">It was just part of a life, but perhaps I was young enough to still catch that little bit of — because my youth was lost in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">And because I was able to recapture some of that childhood in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , it somehow made me feel that this is really the life that counts, even though I lost my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">You know, and it was a terrible loss. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">So that I don't dwell on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I talk about it freely as you could see. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Not that I've rationalized it. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I've just analyzed it, and said that, “If you are going to go through life once, and if you are going to live with your daily cares and your daily expectations, why dwell on something that was too horrible to even ever recount? </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Because most of it sounds likes fiction anyhow.” </span><span class="sentence" id="497">You know that after the war, I had a double set of teeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="498">QUESTION:  How do you mean you had a double set of teeth?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="499">ANSWER:  My baby teeth never fell out — and I still had -and my new teeth came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Because I was undernourished, and my development wasn't — I was a starved child after the war, after all was said and done. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I was tall, but skinny, totally underdeveloped. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">Totally flat, like a board. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">And two rows of teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And when I went to a dentist in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , he sat me down in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chair</span> , and he pulled 12 teeth with his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">You know, one by one. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">Because they were really ready to come out. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">But you know, they were — my physical person, so to say, hadn't yet caught up.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">QUESTION:  You were 15”
ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">I had baby teeth. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And 12 teeth in one setting. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And it wasn't even pulling with anything but his bare hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">But of course that's another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And than of course everything changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">And I have been back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">Once with my husband on a tour, and another one on an interpreting job. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">And I find that I can face it rationally, and think about it rationally. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And realize how it fits in the scheme of things of a human life, and I've made peace with it so to Say.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="518">QUESTION:  You can rationalize?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="519">ANSWER:  Can I rationalize?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="520">QUESTION:  You can rationalize?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="521">ANSWER:  I can, because this is also the nature of your mentality. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">I am by nature optimistic and outgoing. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">So, that 1t would not be true to my type to be spending my life regretting what happened, or what didn't happen, or what I went through, or I didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">I certainly learned a lot from the experiences, even though they're too horrible to recount. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">Because human kindness in all that horror was also a very great part of my survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">There were people who were always taking pity on me, and I don't know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">It was not only my sisters, but also the goodness of other people helped me through. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">You know, people would give me a potato, or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">I don't know if I was such a sorry sight, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">But I survived thanks to human kindness, and the real great help of my two sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">Is there anything else that you would like me to elaborate on?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="532">QUESTION:  And you're not angry? </span><span class="sentence" id="533">You're not angry about your parents, how they died?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="534">ANSWER:  Well, I am not just angry how my parents died.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="535">QUESTION:  And how a whole culture died?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="536">ANSWER:  I am angry what happened to the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">What horror happened, what unspeakable horror that could not even be described. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">That could not even be comprehended. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">That genocide on that scale, that is most unprecedented. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">My parents were dearest to me indeed, but the thousands and thousands of others. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">My big extended family they were tremendous family, and they were such lovely people, and they were such educated people. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">And I grieve for my parents, indeed I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="543">And I was wonderful — terribly attached to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="544">I was the youngest, and rather spoiled, and was very attached to my parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">But as you read history, and study the whole — the whole scene that has unfolded in the second war that was never even contemplated, or one step from the next, was the more horrible step from the next. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">And you never knew who the horror came from, or where the goodness came from, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">And yet, the other people were not treated the way we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">You see, when I always think of those pillows airing in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , where there was real normal life, when we were at the edge of total destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="549">And the fact that you had to witness the most animalistic traits of human nature that you would never suspect people displayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Because anybody, there were people who felt that they could trample you to death if they could grab that one leftover potato, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">That was on the one hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">You saw the basest nature of the human person at its worst, and than you also saw the most wonderful qualities of people; of devotion, and people who shielded you, who cared about you, and who consoled you. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">And after all, I was a child and I needed a lot of consolation, and a lot of good deeds to push me through, aside from my sisters, who weren’t in such wonderful shape themselves to do it, but they did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">When you assess the — it was a trauma. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">But when you assess the whole problem, the whole experience of a huma— of 6,000,000 people you see, and than you fit yourself, that one single person who was really a child into that framework, it boggles the mind, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Therefore, if I chose to contemplate or live that past, I probably would have been a burden forever after. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">And my only and one desire after we were liberated was to never ever be a burden to anybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">That was one thing, because I realized then I was an orphan. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And although I was pulled through by my sisters, of course it didn't happen, because when Miles married Chris, I became another — a charge of his you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">So, even though I was really always being considered a child, when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> I came with a children’s group, with Miles and Chris, but as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">All this is fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">But you see again having that optimistic nature, I felt that grieving over my own past would not get any me anywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Beside, I had not lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">I had not lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">When I was given a chance to live in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , to go to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , to go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Having that wonderful experience to go out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , it was — I just fell in with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="567">This was just the most wonderful thing I could ever dream about. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I guess — am I angry? </span><span class="sentence" id="569">I can't tell you whether I'm angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">I grieve about it, and I think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">But it can't be brought back. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">But I hope it's going to be forever remembered, and prevented from happening again. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">So that is my only hope. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">If our experience could teach the world anything at all about human nature, and about how people can be — how people can actually — the bestiality of one man to another, if people could just learn that, than my experience was worth it. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">To have survived to show the world how such a thing could happen, so that it does not happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">Because if we don't learn from this particular experience, it will probably happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">It's something to work on, not just to think about. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">You know, to work on for a better world. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">But at this point it doesn't look like it, but who knows.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="585">ANSWER:  Yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">Those were during that particular march from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> proper to the <span class="DLF">marshes</span> , where we were to clear the <span class="DLF">marshes</span> and the underbrush alongside the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And because that was a rather lengthy march, in formation with guards guarding us, we did pass quite a number private <span class="BUILDING">dwellings</span> along the way, because we were basically outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="588">Whereas, whether these <span class="BUILDING">dwellings</span> were for Germans who were taking care of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> whether these were Polish people who occupied it, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">However, they really were private <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> and on one of the marches I notices pillows airing in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="590">And that really was a very painful moment, because in normal conditions in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> everybody was airing pillows. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">That was just the thing to do if you lived normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And it brought to mind, that here we were in this situation -- having been separated from our parents, forever probably, and being left alone, not knowing of our future, working under most horrendous conditions -- and here are people who are still living a normal life, airing their pillows, even in such close proximity to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where all these horrible things are happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">And somehow or other, that particular scene reminded my mind, because you know how you sometimes remain with a picture in your mind, well that was the observation that struck me at that time and remained for me ever after. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">And a similar incident, from that particular walk- march rather, from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> proper to the <span class="DLF">marshes</span> and back, which we did everyday while we were working on that, on that job -- is that one day, whether we were going or coming back I don’t remember, but I did notice an eaten apple of a core on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> as we were passing. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I bent down and picked it up and quickly ate it. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And I was myself amazed that I have done it. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">That I was — the hunger that overpowered the even second thought, “Should I pick up this core?” </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Because after all 1t was on the <span class="DLF">road</span> and it could have been thrown away by some sick person, and it could have been the, the — god only knows, dogs could have been over it and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">It absolutely never entered my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">There was this little bit of apple left on the core and this is what I grabbed and ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">And I have very often come back to that, to that — apple core picture, that picture you know, even in this day when you are always concerned about hygiene and “under what circumstances would you do such and such, and not do such and such?” </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Well that is the answer; I did it without any second thought and that was of course probably the only apple I’ve tasted in more than two years at that point and that was — there was at least the taste of the apple of the real thing, of that real life that of course I was separate from. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">So these two incidents remain very clearly in my mind from this particular work detail in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> .

ANSWER:  Many times when I go back to these specific memories, to these specific pictures in my mind I always wonder “Living a world of plenty in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> where things are discarded constantly and I go back to that episode of that core of an apple, of what that could do to a starving person — where of course in hindsight and looking from another perspective in a totally different age I look at it now I am really most impressed of how life can change your approach to things. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">How life can absolutely move you into another <span class="NPIP">dimension</span> to make you aware of values of certain things even such as an eaten apple core, which of course today you would not ever consider anything but garbage. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Because people though away more things that are not garbage in today’s society that we ever dreamt of. </span>
