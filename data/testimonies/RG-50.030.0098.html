..uh...uh...Christian...uh...to come and bring a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buggy</span> and take us up to the <span class="DLF">hill</span> , you know, to hide us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">On Saturday night, I remember we came down like middle of the night...middle of the night, and they put me on because I... was very weak and with my mother and they took us to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> and they put us up in a...on top of the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , you know the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Sunday morning, just like a...can never forget it as long as I live, Sunday morning it was cold you know after a rainy day. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">It was right after Passover. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">It was...uh... uh...very miserable <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , Fall, and there was a lot of Jews hiding out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , you know, there in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So...uh...where we were staying, hiding, there was girls you know, girls, and they were...uh...had boyfriends. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">So Sunday morning the boys came to visit the girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And the Jews came out from out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> to...to sit on the sun to warm up. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">They were freezing. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">They were cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">They were wet. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">So they were sitting under the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , under the sun, and we could, you know, on the top of the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> where...where there was, you know, between the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> you could see. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">So when they...they came to visit the girls, they noticed that Jews are hiding or sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So they went and they took a piece of wood, you know, long thing, you know, wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Went up and they were killing all the Jews, beating on them and killing. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And those horrible screams. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">It still is in my ears. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Those screams. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Please...they begged. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">They were screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">There was a lot of children and crying and screaming. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">It was just unbelievable. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Unbelievable! </span><span class="sentence" id="126">So I told my mother...I start feeling a little better. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I said to my mother, I said, "Look, whatever is going to happen, it all...my father and all rest of the family and all the rest of the Jews has to happen with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">We're not staying here. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">We have to go down. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">We have to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">We have...otherwise, they're going to kill us like....you see what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Those kids...those screaming, those crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">They killed them to death.” </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So the next day, we decided we gonna volunteer go down into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , walk down to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Uh...I was very weak so my mother said...uh...whoever asked us where we're coming from...uh...she's bringing me from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> ...and there was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So slowly, slowly, you know, we walked down and took us hours, but I...I had to rest because I was very...uh...nobody would have anything to do with Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So one time we stopped exactly like I said with my father how they lived...lived together. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">We lived...they lived liked brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">So...uh...sit down on his front, you know, the <span class="DLF">steps</span> where you into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">At least my mother...my mother carried a few stuff, a few things on her back, you know, blankets, some clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">She carried some stuff with her and he...he came out with a piece of wood and he said...uh...he took that stuff from my mother and he said, "You're not going to use...be able to use that. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">They're going to kill you...before I kill you. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">Let..". </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So he wanted ...uh...you know, kill us, beat us up. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">He said, "Don't...I want...I don't want to see you here. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Don't sit here. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">He wouldn't let us sit.” </span><span class="sentence" id="148">So we had to walk further. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">That's..that's why I...every time I remember, you know, I say that...uh..how you live together with friends and everything, but your best friend was your worst enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And it's true. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">And so we finally came down, walked down to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> coming with the rest...some more Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And we went up on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and they took us to...uh...<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and not the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where my father was with the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">We never saw each other. (</span><span class="sentence" id="155">Sigh) Took us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Was the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hungarian ghetto</span> , and...uh..it was terrible there. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">There was this Hungarian policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">He went and they throw down a 50 cent piece, you know, on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and then picked it and went around and asked who threw this money away, and beat everybody who was...he could lay a hand on. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">Beat up everybody with a stick, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Everybody who could...who could just be there close by him, he beat him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And my mother got beaten up terrible. "</span><span class="sentence" id="162">You threw the 50 cents down.” </span><span class="sentence" id="163">My mother said, "No.” </span><span class="sentence" id="164">So he gave her over her face that...uh...blood start pouring you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">So we were there...uh...about 6 weeks in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="166">And then...then they start taking us to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , put us in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> you know, and those...uh...you know what they take the COWS.</span></p>
