<p><span class="sentence" id="0">ANSWER: None
ANSWER: None
QUESTION:  Well I -- Iam curious through the war -- you talked -- you had your family scattered in many different <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and your mom would -- would travel [indecipherable] and I’m sure it’s -- what [indecipherable] look like. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">How much do you know what the other members of your family were doing, where they were, did you [indecipherable] see them from time to time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  It’s very interesting question, and -- and as I go out speaking a lot to <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and so on, that question always comes up, people ask, “How did you know where your father was?” </span><span class="sentence" id="3">An-And I usually don’t have an answer for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I can tell you this, I did not know in the very beginning where my father and mother were, until the raid on the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , when I spent one night after the raid, after my mother and I escaped out of that -- out of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> there, I spent one night at their hi -- their <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , which was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Soest</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">So then I knew where they were. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">My brothers, I never knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">But there was a little time, which I don’t remember too clearly, when my brother Ott, my middle brother, s -- came to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> where I worked, and this was my little brother who came from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , and who needed to be fattened up a little bit, and -- of course, he was also in hiding, but -- and he spent some time with me on this <span class="DLF">farm</span> , I don’t know how long. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">From -- From his interview later on, I -- I deducted he was there at least three weeks, or maybe even a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">I thought it was only a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">So, that period, I knew where my brother Ott was, he was with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">But then he disappeared again, and of course, from the fall of 1944, until the liberation 1945, my father, my two brothers and I were all together. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Some of the communication was achieved through my grandfather’s second wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">My grandfather lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , my grandmother had died years before, he marred a non-Jewish woman, and had a daughter by her. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And I| think that daughter, who was not Jewish, at least she was half Jewish, did not wear a star, and traveled, and I think she managed to send some messages around, and I think it must have been through her that I found where my father and my two little brothers were hiding in that little <span class="BUILDING">summer cottage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">That’s as best as I can tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Course we had no phones, we didn’t write letters, was -- we couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And -- So sometimes it -- I just -- it’s all conjecture, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="18">https://collections.ushmm.org
QUESTION:  How much were you aware of what was going on in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , or with the war, or -- or in terms of what and where, with interest to Jews? </span><span class="sentence" id="19">How would -- How would you get your information?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="20">ANSWER:  The minute that we went underground, of course, we were isolated from the rest of the population of the world, you could say. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">But here and there, you would pick up an illegal piece of newspaper. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">You know, there were -- there were illegal newspapers that consisted usually out of two or four pages, badly printed, and sometimes you would find -- find one of those, or somebody would ha-hand you one of those. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">During my time in the <span class="BUILDING">Resistance hut</span> , of course I found out more, because the men listened to the BBC, and we had a map there, and we charted the progress of the Russians and whatever else was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">And we knew about the -- the bombardments in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">So, at that time, I was pretty well aware of where the -- where the Germans stood, and where the Russians were, and where the English were, and the Americans, and so on, and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">But after the raid, when I went back to the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , I was totally isolated. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">The farmers had -- they would talk about the war, but they -- they didn’t know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">What we could see were, of course, a thousand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">B17 bombers</span> flying over almost every day, and by night we heard the English, a thousand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> going overnight. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">We knew there was enormous bombardments. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">And I had several interesting -- interesting happenings at one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">A <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">liberator bomber</span> came down right around the corner from the <span class="DLF">farm</span> where I worked, and that was the time my brother Ott was there, it seems, because he, in detail, describes how that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> came down, and how we ran there, and -- and how we found a little piece of -- of Plexiglas, little piece of -- from one of the -- one of the <span class="DLF">windows</span> of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bomber</span> , or the -- we -- we savored it like a piece of -- this was a piece of freedom. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">That was one. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">On another <span class="DLF">farm</span> -- this must have been already in the summer of "44, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Messerschmitt 109</span> was shot down, and crashed right into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , right near by the <span class="DLF">farm</span> where I worked, there’s -- there was another <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="34">And I don’t where I had the chutzpah, that I -- I was devoted to flying and -- and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> before the war, already. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I loved <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , and build model <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Anything that would -- flew was to me, was fascinating. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And here was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Messerschmitt 109</span> lying pretty much undamaged except for it’s gear and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">I-It’s propeller bent, and -- and there was a German on guard there, just a soldier guarding the -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And I approached on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , and I asked him if I could take a look, and he said, yeah, that’s all right, and I actually walked around the God damn <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , and touched it, and [indecipherable] all fascinating. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">How did I get onto that? </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Oh, you asked me about what I knew about the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">During our ha -- last hiding, with my two brothers and my father, in the little <span class="BUILDING">summer cottage</span> , we found out nearby, about a five minute walk through the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , there was a big <span class="BUILDING">mansion</span> type <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and in that <span class="BUILDING">house</span> lived a whole collection of people, young and old. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">Later on, we found that several of them were in hiding themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">But, they listened every day to the BBC radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So, some might say the fall of 1944, until the liberation, we knew pretty well what was going on because of the evening -- in the evening we would go there, and we wouldn’t https://collections.ushmm.org listen ourselves, but somebody would go up and listen in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , where they had a radio hidden, and they would tell us, “The Russians are right near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> ,” you know, “and the- the invasion is going well.” </span><span class="sentence" id="46">By this time, of course, the sixth of June, 1944, the allied invasion of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , we knew it was happening. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">And then, of course, we had gone to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arnhem</span> , which was not too far away, the disastrous attempt from the English to -- with paratroopers to capture the <span class="DLF">bridges</span> , and being wiped out, and we thought we would be free then. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So anyway, that much we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="49"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arnhem</span> , we didn’t know the disaster, although it was only a half an hour away from us, we heard all -- End of Tape One, Side A Beginning Tape One, Side B
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Ed Lessing. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">This is tape one, side B. We were just discussing again, your ex- experiences during the war, and you were mentioning the -- the various <span class="NPIP">places</span> that you were in hiding, and one question I wanted to ask is, how many of the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where you hid, how many knew that you were Jewish?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  The very first <span class="NPIP">place</span> , two old ladies, knew I was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">The next one on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> , the first <span class="DLF">farm</span> , <span class="DLF">dairy farm</span> , they did not know. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">In the <span class="BUILDING">Resistance hut</span> , of course they knew I was a Jew, and weren’t too happy about it, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">After the <span class="BUILDING">Resistance hut</span> , when I started going back to farming, on several <span class="DLF">farms</span> , I registered as a -- as a -- as an Christian. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And then we come to -- there are little pieces in between that I don’t even want to go -- where I was a week , or I was a week and a half, or two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I was with my aunt in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> for -- for two weeks or something, and of course she knew was -- I was Jewish, but -- and then we come to the fall of 1944, when I joined my father and my two brothers, and there’s no question, of course, there. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">So, the only <span class="NPIP">places</span> where people didn’t know that I -- that I was Jewish, was on the <span class="DLF">farms</span> where I worked.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">QUESTION:  And again, you mentioned how your mother sort of set everything -- everything up, did a lot of the arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">ANSWER:  Especially in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Not for me later on, I found -- after the raid on the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , I found my own <span class="DLF">farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I was -- I would say I worked there, and w -- I’m not quite sure why I left to go from one <span class="DLF">farm</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I probably thought that it was safer to not stay too long in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">It’s very hard to explain the intensity of -- of the deceit you had to practice. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Your -- Your whole mind was set on deceit. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">What -- What hint could a farmer, let’s say, get from me that I was not who I said I was, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Wa -- My -- My mind was constantly at work, so that I probably decided that it was not a good idea to stay too long in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , because eventually something escapes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">QUESTION:  What sort of things do you remember, were you worried that would give you away? </span><span class="sentence" id="68">Something you would say, or the way you act?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  I’m not quite sure at this point. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">See, this was a 24 hour a day, seven days a week comedy you played. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">This is like being on stage, practically 24 hours a day, every day, even when y -- when you went to sleep, you had to watch out that somebody wouldn’t hear you dreaming, or something, and say something. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">I had a false name. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">I might, by mistake, whisper my own name in my sleep or something, or s -- tell about my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">I didn’t have a mother, you know, and the mother and father had died years ago in bombardments, both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">I mean, the stories that you made up, to -- in order t -- tho - it was a whole -- 1 -- this was a whole false lifetime of history. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Where did you come from, did you have family? </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Where did you live? </span><span class="sentence" id="78">How come you’re working on a <span class="DLF">farm</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="79">You’re from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">How come you work so well? </span><span class="sentence" id="81">You know. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Why -- We’ve had city boys here, they -- they never worked that well, they didn’t know how to go plow a <span class="DLF">field</span> with a horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">How come you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="84">You know, this kind of stuff, and what is he thinking? </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Is he talking with his neighbors about this guy we have from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , who works so well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">QUESTION:  And was that a time where farmers may have been suspicious, that -- since that sort of thing was happening, and --
ANSWER:  That I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">You see, in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , a Jew would stand out like a -- how do I say that? </span><span class="sentence" id="89">A mouse on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">billiard table</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">I could instantly recognize if I saw another Jew someplace in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And I’ve seen some on the -- on the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , once, when I was waiting for my mother to show up, and -- and I saw a man, and I immediately recognized this guy is -- is a hidden Jew, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">So, I thought, why don’t the other recognize me, maybe, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">The -- The skill and deception was like- it was like a spy story, spy who could construct a whole false -- false background, you https://collections.ushmm.org know? </span><span class="sentence" id="94">It was like -- And you had to make sure that you didn’t slip up anywhere, not a street address, not where you were 10 years ago, not where your father and mother had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">You know, you know, this kind -- not show any dislike of big chunks of -- of bacon, or ham being put on your -- you know, not the nice bacon that we get, with slices like a half inch thick, you know, it’s with all the fat on it, and farmers gleefully ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And I ate them, and I said in my head, I said -- asked God for forgiveness that I had to do this. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">But all that was a -- it’s like being onstage, and it’s very, very tiresome, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So anyway, it’s hard to -- very hard to explain what -- what it took to stay out of the clutches of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And I -- There was a second time when I almost -- almost got caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">The first time was, of course, the raid on the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , second one was later on when my -- when we all lived in that little <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> , and I -- we went every day to get some food in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">There was a <span class="INT_SPACE">central kitchen</span> then, food being scarce, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And all of a sudden I ran into a German on this <span class="DLF">dirt road</span> leading to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">I was on this crummy <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> that we had, and -- and this German stopped me, and wanted to see my identity card. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I was lucky, he was -- I th -- I have no idea w-what he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">You see, this is another part, to immediately gauge, if you saw a German, what kind of a German is this? </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Is this just a -- a -- Wehrmacht soldier? </span><span class="sentence" id="107">He doesn’t know shit from shinola, you know, he doesn’t know about Jews, or identity cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">But, I once ran into an SS man, and that’s a separate story. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">But -- But this guy questioned me, and I couldn’t figure out -- he was not SS, he didn’t have the SS on his -- on his collar, and yet, he seemed to intensely question https://collections.ushmm.org me, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And I just said that I lived -- that I was a farmer’s [indecipherable] farmer here down the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">I was on -- on a -- and could see him swaying back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">But what the hell he would have done, I have no idea, because this was -- we’re talking now, probably late fall 1944, when -- when everything was already in disarray for the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">Any case, that was a moment when everything sort of tightened up, and you stood there, and you said, is it going to go right, or is it going to go wrong? </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Is this the last- is this it? </span><span class="sentence" id="115">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And it wasn’t, but it was almost. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Okay, I don’t know if I answered your question, but --
QUESTION:  Well, another question I had, from the video interviews, is that -- I -- I’m interested in- in your father, it seems like, to a certain extent, he tried to maintain a normal life, during -- throughout the hiding is -- you mentioned that he had painting lessons once a week, for example.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Yes, he did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="119">QUESTION:  He -- He sounds like -- like an interesting character.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">ANSWER:  My father was an interesting man, he -- he was a kind of an ineffective man, 1 -- that -- and my mother always held him up as the artist in the family, and she was the one who took care of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">Even -- I mean, after the war, before the war, she was the driving factor, sort of, in -- in -- you know, getting everything done. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">But here they were, these two people, in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , for two and a half years. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You ever sat in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for two and a half years without going out? </span><span class="sentence" id="124">It’s not easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And he began to do sketches, put little still lifes on https://collections.ushmm.org the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , or -- and then he started painting with watercolors a little bit, and pastels, and my mother got him art materials, and it was a God given thing, you know, cause he would have gone crazy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And then, through somehow another, they found this painter -- I have a painting of him [indecipherable] upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">I have several painting of my father, and also of his teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Found this teacher where he went once a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I didn’t want to go into the details about it, but I told you about the raid on the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , and that my mother came to rescue us in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">The reason why she knew was, when my buddy and I ran off from the raid, we wound up in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hilversum</span> , I remember that my father took painting lessons from a man named Shlutter, a painter, well-known painter in- in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And that this man lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hilversum</span> , where we were, and I decided that -- we didn’t know where the <span class="NPIP">hell</span> to go, that I would to this Shlutter, because obviously he was all right, he was somebody we could trust, because he gave my father painting lessons. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">It so happened when we -- we took a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> there, a little -- a little sht -- a little -- little -- a -- a s-- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tram</span> , and it so happened when we got there, my father was there, painting, you know, very quiet in the <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> of this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And my father said, “What are you doing here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And my father never was very perceptive in things, and I told him, “Pop, we were raided,” you know? “</span><span class="sentence" id="135">And I think all the men probably are -- are going to be dead.” </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And he said, “Gee, gee, hm.” </span><span class="sentence" id="137">But he didn’t interrupt his lesson or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And he said, “So where you going to be today?” </span><span class="sentence" id="139">I said, “Well, we don’t know, we're,” -- and I don’t know where we were all day, until we wound up in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">But one thing is for sure, my father eventually went back to his <span class="NPIP">hiding place</span> , and told my mother, and my mother immediately grasped the seriousness of the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">My father didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And she -- how she found out, I don’t know, I think probably to Mr. Oskam, the policeman, where the hell we would meet that night. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So my father painted, and my mother -- and my mother took care of the -- tried to save the rest of her family, and did, and saved herself, too, of which I will tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">But his -- his glor-glory period came when we were all hiding in that little <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> , from the fall of 1944, until the liberation, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">He became a real strong father, you could almost say a brother to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">He and I took care of the boys, and ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">But he and I decided what -- how to find food, where to steal <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Where to beg for sandwiches from the farmers, or something, anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">It was like a team. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">When my father died, probably about 10 years ago, or so, I really felt like one of our team had died, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="151">He shouldn’t have died, we should have all died together, my two brothers, my father, and I, we were a team, a wonderful team of -- that managed to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And my father died, of course he died, but it was like losing a member of a string quartet, you know, and say God, you know, irreplaceable. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Anyway, so I have many funny stories about my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">My father mostly is known in the family for his funny stories, because he did so many things out of -- I don’t know, re -- because he didn’t -- he wasn’t aware. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">My wife always says, “Your father never was aware.” </span><span class="sentence" id="156">My father wasn’t aware of what the hell was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Hewasn’t even aware that I was in -- wa -- you know, wa -- my life was threatened when I was there, you know, with my buddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">So, I hope that answers that question, maybe.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION:  I wonder from a certain sense that -- that led him -- that let him get through the experiences in a way different from other people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER:  I didn’t understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">What did you say?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">QUESTION:  That him being aware -- sh -- maybe shutting things out, allowed him to sort of maintain some of his former life all through that -- the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  That’s probably -- probably so, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">He’s an interesting man, I was never very close to him, except for that period then. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I could tell you for hours about him, but I don’t think this is the <span class="NPIP">place</span> to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">He -- He tried all his life to not be a musician, and yet, he only was a musician, he always went back to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And after the war, when we moved to -- or when they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span> , <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> , my father really had -- I said, well, his only glory period was during the war, that isn’t quite true. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">After they moved to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span> , <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> , and my father began to play in the Springfield Symphony, and he played in the Hartford Symphony, he was a cellist, and he set up a string quartet with friends, and they gave concerts in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pittsfield</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">Fine Arts Museum</span> , those were glorious times for him, because he loved music. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">So -- But during the war, and of course, I don’t know all of it, because they were in hiding, my father and mother together, and somehow another -- I think my father probably had an easier time of it than my mother, because he could lose himself for hours in sketching a glass of water, and -- anda little jar, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="170">I have many of his sketchbooks still upstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">So, where do we go from here?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  Well, let’s go -- let’s continue after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">QUESTION:  Let’s talk about the war ended, and -- and what happened with you and the family from there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  All right. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I may duplicate some of it that was in the -- oh no, I ge -- I don’t know where the original video -- video interview ended.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="177">QUESTION:  It ends pretty much at the end of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="178">ANSWER:  When we were liberated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  Nothing after that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="181">QUESTION:  Very little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">ANSWER:  Very little. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">All right, the first thing I have to tell you about 1s -- its’ a little bit difficult, the structure is a little bit different. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">I must first tell you about what happened to my mother, because it -- then I can go back to -- to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">My mother, as I said, was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">And interestingly enough, she had a -- she had a dream -- my mother was always a little psychic, by the way, very interesting. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">There were times that she would say to my father, “I think your father is maybe coming for a visit from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> today.” </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And I don’t know, three out of five times, there was my grandfather in the afternoon, youknow, ringing the doorbell. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">So we always thought she was, what we call in Dutch, helderzingda, clear -- clear voyant -- clairvoyant. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">She had a dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I think -- I think it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dutch camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="192">She had a dream in which she saw a newspaper, a masthead of a newspaper, and that said, January 21, very big, and she woke up from it. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">And she thought, “I wonder what that means, if it means something.” </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And she thought, ‘Either I will be dead by then, or I will be free.” </span><span class="sentence" id="195">But then, how could she be free? </span><span class="sentence" id="196">I mean, she was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and soon after that, she was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="197">And one day in January, a friend of hers, who she slept with in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunkbed</span> , you know, the wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunkbeds</span> they had there, said, “You know, Lene,” she was always called Lene, from -- from Angeline, “Lene,” she said, “there is an SS guy sitting in -- in the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and he’s checking on people who have foreign nationality.” </span><span class="sentence" id="198">And my mother said, “Well, I don’t have foreign nationality.” </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And her friend said, “But yeah, you said when you were interrogated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , you told him you don’t have any right to keep me here, because I am an American citizen?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="200">Yes,” said my mother, ‘so what? </span><span class="sentence" id="201">You know, I don’t have any papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">I’m not really an American.” </span><span class="sentence" id="203">Okay, I got to go back, I got to b-backtrack, got to backtrack for a second to the interrogation in May 1944, when she was caught in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , in front of the Gestapo there. [</span><span class="sentence" id="204">indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">They asked her what’s your name, and I told you she gave her maiden name, Angeline Elizabeth Van Leer, and as an afterthought they said -- she said, “And you don’t have any right to keep me here, because I am an American citizen.” </span><span class="sentence" id="206">And they asked her, “If you’re an American citizen, where did you live in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="207">Give us an address.” </span><span class="sentence" id="208">And she rattled off <span class="DLF">121 LaMartine Street</span> , Jamaica Plains, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="209">And it’s a wonderful thing, because it was one of the addresses where we had lived in 1929, when my parents for three years, emigrated from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="210">It was a lousy year to come to the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , 1929, my father got sick, he got tuberculosis, and so on, everything went wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">In 1932 they returned again to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But they did live at <span class="DLF">121 LaMartine Street</span> , <span class="DLF">Jamaica Plains</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boston</span> , and my mother remembered it, and rattled it off in front of the Gestapo, and they wrote it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">They must have laughed, but they wrote it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">So, now we go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , and it’s January 1945, and things are really getting bad in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I -- Sorry, I have to s-suddenly think of S- Spiegelman’s, “Maus Two,” which bears the title -- when his father arrives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen</span> , either from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , or wherever he came from, some horror, comes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , and says, “And here’s where my troubles really began.” </span><span class="sentence" id="216">It’s -- It’s tragic, but it’s funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Anyway, my mother came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , and here’s where our troubles really began. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Sh -- Her friend said, “Go to this S -- SS guy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="219">My mother said, “Why, ba, ba.” </span><span class="sentence" id="220">Says, “Go, go, go anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">So what do you have to lose?” </span><span class="sentence" id="222">So she went to this <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , there was an SS guy sitting, and he was just closing the books, and sh -- he said, “What do you want?” </span><span class="sentence" id="223">And she said, “Well, I hear you’re checking on people with foreign papers?” </span><span class="sentence" id="224">And he said, “Yes,” he said, “but I just finished.” </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And she begged him to open the book again, and he opened the list again, and he said, ““What’s your name?” </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And she said, “Angeline Elizabeth Van Leer.” </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And he went down the list and he said, “Oh yeah,” he said, “you get yourself ready, and two days from n-now, you will be -- you will be exchanged for a German.” </span><span class="sentence" id="228">And she didn’t believe a word for it -- of it, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="229">But two days later, there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">There was not a <span class="DLF">railroad spur</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen- Belsen camp</span> , as you may ha -- may know, but there was -- people had to walk for two miles outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , or Belsen-Bergen station, whatever it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> standing there with a big red cross on it, and she went in there with 301 other Bergen-Belsen inmates, and as she came in -- she tells this all later on, I’m re -- I’m retelling now what she told to my brother Fred in interviews later on. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">She said there was an SS sitting there at a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and she said, “Could I have a little water? </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I’m very thirsty.” </span><span class="sentence" id="234">She had been walking. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And he said, “Sit down, you’re going to get coffee soon.” </span><span class="sentence" id="236">And of course, she didn’t believe a word of that, either, but a little later, a nurse came in with a tray with real coffee, whi -- nobody had seen in years. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">And then she began to believe that maybe it wasn’t a ruse, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="238">What they used to do to Germans wa -- load 1,000 people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , promising them to go to -- you know, be freed, and they, you know, two days later, they’d be all gassed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , or <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sobibor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">So that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> really started out and went through -- was very secure, there’s a route -- route through <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and my mother later on says very gleefully, they all saw the bombed out cities of <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">We’re talking now January 1945, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">We’re approaching the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would up in, I forget, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Dollan</span> , I thinkshe mentioned. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It’s in <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="244">And they came in on one side of the -- of the <span class="DLF">platform</span> , and -- an-and another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> came on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , and they were exchanged for Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And I got to tell you the rest of this, because otherwise what I tell you later makes no sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">The first night, they spent, sh -- this is a footnote to the Swiss treatment of dying -- 300 s -- terribly sick and dying Bergen-Belsen inmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They put them in an abandoned <span class="BUILDING">school building</span> on straw, and for the few -- first meal, my mother said, “They gave us white bread, and cans of sardines.” </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And she said -- she couldn’t help herself, she said she opened the can of sardines and poured the oil in the sardines over the white bread, and just ate and ate and ate. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">And she said, “I never was as sick in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> as I was that night.” </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And finally she found some relief in the morning by throwing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">It was a terrible night, she said. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">She’d never been so sick in all those -- in all her -- all her time in -- in the -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , or in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">And it got to be morning, and the others were still asleep, I think, and a little boy came by, and she had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and hadn’t -- did not know what was happening in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And she asked the boy if it was possible to get a newspaper somewhere, and he said he could, and he ran off, and he came back with a newspaper, a Swiss newspaper, and she opened it. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">It said January 21‘, and she was free. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Now magical things, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="257">That’s amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">My mother was a pretty amazing person. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Anyway, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> went on, or another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and they wound up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marseilles</span> , and there she was given a choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">She could go either to her sister in <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> , or she could go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And she decided she -- and the third choice was she could go to United Nations rehabilitation camp someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">And she decided she’d go to her sister in <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> , and for there there was a -- a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> lying there, the Gripsholm, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Scandinavian ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">And that was transporting wounded American soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">And she was already on board of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and then suddenly she changed her mind, and she ran off, and one of the officers there said, “You can’t do this, you already,” -- but sh -- he could never impress my mother, and she ran off the -- off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and said she changed her mind, she wanted to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">rehabilitation camp</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">United Nations camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="265">And so they put her on another <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , and I think they traveled for a whole week over the <span class="REGION">Mediterranean</span> , I don’t know why it took so damn long, but she finally wound up in a United Nations rehabilitation camp called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jeandark</span> , which was located in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philipville</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> , <span class="REGION">North Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="266">That’s where she stayed until the end of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Now, okay, we’ll leave her there, sitting there, safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Go back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Forthausen</span> , where we were in hiding in the little <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> , and we are a couple of weeks liberated, and I could tell you many stories, I don’t know how long you want to do this interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I could tell you a funny -- I think I really should tell you this story, cause it is so funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">The Canadians came, and we spent three days in a <span class="INT_SPACE">dugout shelter</span> , until -- under a fierce artillery bombardment, and then we came out, and we were free, and the Canadians settled all around us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , and there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> there, and God knows, and it was -- it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But we didn’t have anything much more to eat, so my father went -- and we had been making something that was called coffee, but it was made out of ground up shells of -- of -- what do you call that fruit that comes from a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">oak tree</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  An acorn?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  Acorns, ground up acorn shells. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">It was horrible stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">My father went and persuaded the Canadian cook in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> that this was the best stuff, and he exchanged it for three cans of corned beef, or something, which we hadn’t seen in years. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">And so -- And we went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and we found in -- we found in -- a German mortar, and with the ammunition, and we went and sold that to the Canadians for -- for sugar and tea, and -- anyway, but -- oh no, not for sugar, for tea, an-an-and -- and bread, and -- but we didn’t have any sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So my father peddled on this old little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and he saw there was a detachment of military police, huge guys, as he explained to them, broad shoulders, and they had these enormous gloves, and they had Harley-Davidson motorcycles with MP on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">These were tough bastards, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And my father went up to -- to one of them, [indecipherable] already, went up to one of them, and said, “Sir, would you have some sugar for us? </span><span class="sentence" id="280">We -- We’ve been -- hadn’t had any sugar.” </span><span class="sentence" id="281">Guy was a redhead, with a red moustache, as my father ex -- described him. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">The guy said, ““What’s the matter with you, begging around here? </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Say, you a Jew?” </span><span class="sentence" id="284">My father -- this is after two and a half years of not being a Jew, he said, “No, no, no, no, I’m not a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I,” -- you know -- he says, “No, I just need -- wanted some sugar.” </span><span class="sentence" id="286">He said, “Get the hell out of here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="287">And my father went -- left him. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">The next day he happened to be in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> again, and https://collections.ushmm.org they were breaking up. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">The whole first division Canadian army was pulling through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Endless, you know, miles and miles of -- of <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchens</span> , and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , and carriers, and End of Tape One, Side B Beginning Tape Two, Side A
QUESTION:  This is a interview with Ed Lessing, tape two, side A, and we were just continuing on your story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">ANSWER:  All right, this little story when my father came back into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and saw the military police unit breaking up, and he went up again, to the redhead guy, who was just about getting on his huge Harley-Davidson motorcycle, and revving up the engine, and my father said -- and the guy said, “Are you here again?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="292">Yeah,” said my father. “</span><span class="sentence" id="293">I wondered if you left behind any sugar.” </span><span class="sentence" id="294">The guy said, “I asked you yesterday, are you a Jew?” </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And my father said, “No, no, I told you I’m not a Jew.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="296">Well,” he said, “you see, I’m Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I would have given you sugar if you were a Jew, but I don’t give to any goyim.” </span><span class="sentence" id="298">And he roared off on his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="299">Ah, this is a lovely, lovely story. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">You -- You got to realize that my family is a story telling family, both my brothers, and my father, and I, we all tell stories, and we remember them. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So, our whole family is suffused with stories, and this is -- this is a -- a cutie from -- from the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">Anyway -- from right after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Okay, get -- let’s get serious again. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">A couple of weeks after our liberation, my father tells me, he said, “You know, they told me in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnfeld</span> ,” -- a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> nearby, “there are Some men -- some men who have lists, and they take care of -- of -- of -- of -- of our Jewish people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="305">That was all he knew, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">So he said, “I’m going to go there, find out about mutter,” the Dutch word for mother, we always called her mutter. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I said, “Yeah, sure.” </span><span class="sentence" id="308">And he rattled off on this old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , and th -- and -- and by that time, I https://collections.ushmm.org al-always keep on talking about rattling <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bikes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">You see, we didn’t have any air tires any more. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Tires were made then either out of wooden strips, very cleverly, wound around with steel wire around the rim, or if you were a little bit better, old car tires were stripped, the rubber -- solid rubber was then wound around, and so -- but you can imagine, within about a month, everything rattled loose on your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , so they always rattled. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Anyway, my father set off, and he went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnfeld</span> , and as he -- and now I’ Il have to quote him, because he tells this later, also in the interview, he -- he -- he reaches <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barnfeld</span> , and he goes there into a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and behind a rickety <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , he find three older -- older men, yeah, three older, Jewish men, and the -- and they said, “Can we help you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And as -- he said, “Yes,” he said, and -- and I’m trying to express this as naive as we were still. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">My father says, “Yes, my -- my wife was -- was arrested, and she was in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westerbork</span> , in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and then she was sent somewhere to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I would like to find out where she is.” </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So they said, “Well, you’re in luck, because we don’t know anything right now,” he said, “but s -- one of a -- one of our men is in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and he 1s coming back with all the lists, and where everybody is.” </span><span class="sentence" id="315">And we’re talking about 110,000 Dutch Jews, shipped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And my father said, “Oh, thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Ill be back in a week.” </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And a week later -- And he tells this to me when he comes back to our little <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , we’re still living in that little <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> , not a <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And a week later, he goes again. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">And as he tells it later, he said, “There I saw the three men again,” he said, “but they weren’t the same.” </span><span class="sentence" id="321">He said physically they were the same, but mentally they were completely beaten down. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">They said, “Mr. Lessing, we have just found out about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and there were <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And there’s a very -- hardly anybody 1s alive still.” </span><span class="sentence" id="324">In my speeches I always say this is the moment that they found out what we now call the Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">We didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">We didn’t know what happened to those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> that left every Tuesday out of <span

</span><span class="sentence" id="328">And they found it out, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">So, it was a terrible thing, and -- and -- and they said that we have lists, but there’s hardly anybody on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">He said, “They all murdered? </span><span class="sentence" id="331">Murdered?” </span><span class="sentence" id="332">He couldn’t believe it. “</span><span class="sentence" id="333">Well,” my father said, “but, could you just look, maybe my wife is on there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And he said, “Well, we give you very little chance, Mr. Lessing,” he didn’t want to [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And he went down the list, Red Cross list, and he said, “But she’s here, your wife is here. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Angeline Elizabeth Lessing Van Leer.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="337">God,” my father said. “</span><span class="sentence" id="338">How wonderful,” he said, “where is she?” </span><span class="sentence" id="339">And this little old man said, “She’s in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philipville</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="340">My father said, ““Where’s <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philipville</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="341">They said, “<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Philipville</span> is -- 1-1-it says here, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">North Africa</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="342">And -- And another funny story. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">My father said, “No, that’s impossible, cause we never had anything to do with <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="344">We never were in <span class="COUNTRY">Africa</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="345">He said, “Tha -- those -- that’s ca-can’t be,” you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And as he said that, the little old man got kind of insulted, and he said, “Mr. Lessing, the Red Cross never makes a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">She must be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Now, you better go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and tell your children.” </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And so my father went back, and he came back, and he told https://collections.ushmm.org us, “Your mother is alive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="350">It was exactly a year, practically to the day that she was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">It was May, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Well, that was one surprising thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="353">QUESTION:  When were you reunited with -- with your mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="354">ANSWER:  I’m not quite sure, but I think 1t must have been in August. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">We -- A couple of weeks later, we went on a -- on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Canadian army truck</span> , and voyaged back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And I must say, we were helped enormously by the members of the Resistance, the people who have been in the Resistance, who were still in charge then, before the other creeps from -- who had never done anything, came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> , and started to take over, and they [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">But it was still in disarray, you know, and the Resistance people were in charge, and my father and his three sons came there, back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> , and they said, “Ah, Mr. Lessing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="358">They knew him, and they said, ““What do you need?” </span><span class="sentence" id="359">And my father said, “Oh, we need a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to live.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="360">Well, we’ll give you a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">We got <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> from Nazis, Dutch Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">We’ve thrown them -- We’ve thrown them out, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">They’re in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> now,” and so we got a -- we got a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , three floors, I mean, they’re all been a -- you know, not <span class="BUILDING">detached houses</span> , they’re <span class="BUILDING">row houses</span> , with three floors. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And they said, “What else do you need?” </span><span class="sentence" id="365">And he said -- “Well,” my father said, “TI need some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And, “Okay, we give you <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And they gave us a -- a [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">They had a whole <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> full of stuff confiscated from Dutch Nazis, and we got that, and we got spoons, and forks, and knives, and even some curtain materials, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">And -- And they said, “What else do you need?” </span><span class="sentence" id="370">My father said, “Well, I -- you know, I’m a music teacher, I -- I had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> .” “</span><span class="sentence" id="371">Oh, we’ll give you a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="372">They gave him a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">piano</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="373">So, my father and I fixed up this new <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">abode</span> as well as we could. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">We put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , which was all disjointed pieces, you know, I mean, non- matching pieces, and where we thought it would do the best good, and -- and we hung up curtains on strings, and -- and that’s how we started out. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And my brothers went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="376">God, I wished I could read to you the piece that my brother wrote about going back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">He was -- See, born in 1936, must have been about nine years old when he went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="378">He wrote recently in a speech to the Michigan State Assembly, he -- he wrote a little piece about going back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="379">He said that we were -- as if nothing had happened, open your book to page number 25, and he said, after two and a half years of being shit, you know, after being in hiding, after -- after denying our -- our - Our -- Our -- Our -- OUr names, and our religion, and -- it was like -- I mean, the way he says it, a beautiful speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">Anyway, the boys went back to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and right around the corner there was a -- there were <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , and they became a -- a -- a pr- a prisoner of war camp for -- for Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">And the engl -- There were English soldiers guarding them, and every day we would see them march through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , you know, they went to -- God knows what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Oh, they -- they -- I don’t know what they did, and - and then one day, something magic hap -- magical happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">My brothers, who would go and hang around there, to see those German prisoners there in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and they’re looking through the <span class="DLF">gates</span> , and one day they came, and there were no longer English soldiers there, they were soldiers who had a Jewish star on their sleeve. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">And it said, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">They came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and they said, “They had Jewish soldiers there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="386">I don’t know, but my father and I didn’t believe a word at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">What do you mean Jewish sol -- there are no Jewish soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">So we went to look, son of a bitch, there was these euys, just like the English standing there, you know, guarding the <span class="DLF">gate</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">So, the way that my brother told it later on, my -- my little brothers went there, and they -- they said, “How do we make clear to them that we are Jewish boys?” </span><span class="sentence" id="390">So, my brother Ott, who was always kind of inventive, said, “Yeah, I know something. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Let’s go, and I’ll stand next to him, and I’Il sing us the only Jewish song I know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="392">And he started to hum, didn’t know any words. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And he started [sings notes] which I think it -- I’m not quite sure what it is, but he said -- 1t’s a well known song, I think, that people sing at Passover, or you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And the soldier looked at him, and said, “Come here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="395">He said, “Are you Jewish boys?” </span><span class="sentence" id="396">They said, “Yes.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="397">Come in.” </span><span class="sentence" id="398">And they brought them into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> and they became the mascots of that battalion, and every day <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> would pull up in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and soldiers’d say, “Are the boys here? </span><span class="sentence" id="399">We want to take them up to a trip.” </span><span class="sentence" id="400">And it was all wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">In August, I think, 1945, I came back from a Zionist meeting in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="402">We lived again in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> , which is about 20 minutes by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> one way. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">I came back from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , from a Zionist meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">My cousin had said, “You better go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> , there’s a group of kids there, they all were in hiding, and they sing songs, and they dance, and then there are also nice girls there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Well, I -- here I was, I was 18 or 19, never been https://collections.ushmm.org kissed, never been to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> with a girl, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I mean, my teenage years were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Girls, God. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">I wa -- In no time, I was on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , and it was wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">There was all these boys and girls, and then there were the soldiers of the Jewish Brigade, who brought food and drink, and they took us for weekends, and I joined this Zionist group. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">There’s also a girl there called Carla Hymons, but she was three years younger, and kind of a kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">I didn’t pay too much attention to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">Course, now I been married to her for 50 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Anyway, I came back one evening from a Zionist meeting, Sunday -- Sunday morning, came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">It was -- It was dusk, and I approached our new <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and there was an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">English army truck</span> standing in front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , which was nothing special, because the- the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span> always had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> standing there in -- but a-as I ran by, from under that -- that camouflage canvas, a woman’s voice called, and said, “Oh sir, could you tell me where the Lessings live?” </span><span class="sentence" id="415">It was my mother’s voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">I’ve always been warned, when doing interviews for the Shoah Foundation, watch out, departures and reu -- when people reunite, that’s when people start to cry, and it’s true. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">It always -- It always happens that way, because that was my mother -- my mother’s voice, and I barely had strength to -- to say, “Mother, it’s me, it’s Eddie.” </span><span class="sentence" id="418">And she came out of that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , not at all what we expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">She was all tanned. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">She came in an army jumpsuit. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I mean, we ex-expected this Bergen-Belsen emaciated, sick person, but of course, she had recuperated marvelously out there in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> , and as a matter of fact, typically like my mother, in no time at all, I understand, a few weeks after she arrived there, she was in charge of the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> already.</span><span class="sentence" id="422">Anyway, there she was, and we rang the doorbell, and my father came, and -- and he was just, you know, he just -- he kept on saying to her, “Just sit down, I just want to look at you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="423">And she walked around [indecipherable] and she had -- she had boxes full of stuff to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">And we had saved one chocolate bar, that had fallen out of the <span class="DLF">sky</span> one day when we were still hiding in that little <span class="BUILDING">cottage</span> during the winter of 1944 - ’45. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">The English made a mistaken drop of an enormous amount of weapons and radios, and also <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">food canisters</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">And I had managed to get one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">food canisters</span> , and hide it until the Germans had taken everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">The Germans had been warned, and they came and took everything, but they didn’t get this. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">Out of that, we had saved, for all those months, one little chocolate bar for my mother when she -- when she would come back, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">And here she was with boxes full of stuff, you know, with chocolates, and cigarettes, and whatever she could have got of there, out in that -- anyway, well there she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">She had flown back -- two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> had flown from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and as I later h-heard -- this is -- I mean, this is the God damnedest ironic and horrible thing, one of the -- one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bombers</span> , w-with survivors, had flown from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Algiers</span> back to Europe, to <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="431">Most of them were Dutch. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">One of them -- One of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> crashed, and everybody was killed, but the other one arrived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> , and my mother from there hitchhiked, [indecipherable] and finally wound up in front of our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and there she was. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">And my brother Ott, in his hurry to see her, he fell down the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">He rolled down two <span class="INT_SPACE">floors</span> of -- of <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , and it was pandemonium, but it was glorious, glorious, glorious. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And my mother https://collections.ushmm.org walked around, and she said, “Oh, beautiful, this 1s -- 1s this ours? </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And my father said, “Yes, this is our h-home now.” </span><span class="sentence" id="437">And she said, “Oh look at all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> you have, and - and,” -- this is the -- my father telling, you know, again, a little story, a mini story, he says, and she walked around, and she said, “Oh, it’s so beautiful, and -- and look, you even put curtains, and I,” -- she was so impressed. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">She said -- But the next morning, when she got up, she said, “Well, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> 1s not right there, we got to move that, and those curtains, they got to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">Th-That’s -- That’s a mess, and,” he said -- my father starts shifting everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">Typically, like a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And then my brother said, “Mom, there are Jewish soldiers around in, and they guarding prisoners of war.” </span><span class="sentence" id="442">You know what my mother said? </span><span class="sentence" id="443">She said, “I never want to see another Jew in my life.” </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Oh, it was shocking. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">However, three weeks later, at a party in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish Brigade</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Italian camp</span> , she was a performer, she was an amateur singer. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">She sang Yiddish and Jewish songs for them, and she just loved it, so.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="447">QUESTION:  What did that mean to her, or to you at that point that she [inaudible] see another Jew in her life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="448">ANSWER:  If you read what she tells about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , she said everybody stole from everyone else. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">She said you couldn’t leave a -- a hanky lying around, you find the next day it was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">If you -- well, at one point -- I -- I can’t tell you the whole story of my mother, but th-there -- she tells about one night, she ca -- she wa -- she -- she managed to get a job in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , from I think midnight until seven in the morning, or something https://collections.ushmm.org like that, where she was once in a while be able to steal some -- a potato or something, which would -- she would then divide with her friend, or something else, a lit -- tiny bit of extra food. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">And she said, “One morning I came back from my job, and the whole <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> was empty.” </span><span class="sentence" id="452">And she said the Germans had this crazy mania, like every two weeks or so, they would move everybody around into different <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , for no God damn reason that anybody could see. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">But then you had to move your stuff, and if you weren’t there when you, as she wasn’t -- she -- she came, and it -- it was in the middle of the winter, it was very cold, she says, bitterly cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Snow everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">And she said, “I came, and there was no one there, and all my stuff was gone.” </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And she said, “I sat at the <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , the empty <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> ,” she said, “and I cried.” </span><span class="sentence" id="457">And she said, “I don’t want to go on, this is the end, I -- I don’t want to go fight any more.” </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And that’s her- with her magical thing, she said, “I heard a voice saying, you must go on, don’t give up, don’t give up, you must go on, you must live,” she says, “and then I -- I schlepped myself to the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> where they had gone, and I pushed somebody aside so I could get a <span class="NPIP">place</span> in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunkbed</span> , and -- to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">And I borrowed a blanket from a friend,” or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Anyway, she continued on. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">So -- But she said you couldn’t trust anyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">They would sell your -- their -- your -- their souls for -- for -- you know, they’ll sell you for a -- for a piece of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">So her impression of Jews was like, what do you expect, you know’? </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Anyway, let me continue with the story, otherwise we’ll sit here until a long, long time yet, because there’s more to come on this. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">So, my mother was back, and I went back toschool. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">Now I was -- I was a terrible scholar, I -- I -- I had been to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> , and failed, had been held back. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">In -- In -- In desperation my father had asked a neighbor, ““Wh-What should I do with my son?” </span><span class="sentence" id="468">And the neighbor had said, “Do you know what’s a good profess -- send him to trade school, he learn profession.” </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And then my father, “What -- What kind of a <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="470">What kind of a profession,” and -- and this man said, “Well,” he said, “I work with people who are instrument makers. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">They -- They -- They -- They make and repair scientific instruments.” </span><span class="sentence" id="472">He said, “It’s a good job,” he said, “and maybe your son can learn that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="473">So, I don’t know if you know the Yiddish expression, ashander? </span><span class="sentence" id="474">It means -- It means -- It means a -- it’s a terrible thing in the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">It used to be said if a -- if a girl marries a non-Jew, that’s ashander, it’s -- it’s Yiddish, and it means -- it’s a -- it’s a -- it’s a terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">So here my -- I probably was the only Jewish boy who ever was in that <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="477">I mean, there were no Jewish kids in <span class="BUILDING">trade schools</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="478">They became lawyers and doctors and writers, and whatever, but here I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">I had gone to the <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span> , and during the war, when the Germans decided Jewish kids couldn’t go any longer in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , I was out of <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="480">And now the war was over, and I went back to the <span class="BUILDING">trade school</span> , and I finished one year of -- to get a diploma in instrument making. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">It didn’t take very long after that, I worked at one jo -- I worked at two jobs, and -- with instrument companies in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Delft</span> , and first as an apprentice in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , and later on -- my mother made another decision for me, come to think of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">My mother said, “Why don’t you take a little vacation before,” you know, and -- oh, the https://collections.ushmm.org first job I had, I worked in a <span class="BUILDING">machine shop</span> , as an apprentice tool maker, or instrument maker, and I had a -- I found out I had an anti-Semitic boss, a g -- a guy who said Jews are no good. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">And I told this at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and my mother said, “You quit, right now.” </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And I quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">She says, “Now you to-take a vacation,” oh no, first, “go around, see if you get another job.” </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And I went to another -- there was another instrument company, very prestigious one, and I asked for a job there, and they said, “Well, we don’t have aj -- we don’t have a position in -- in the -- in the sh -- in the -- the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> , but w-we could take you on as an apprentice draftsman.” </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And I said, “No, I -- I work in the <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="488">My mother said, “Why don’t you go take a vacation for a week?

</span><span class="sentence" id="672">And -- But before that, I should tell you another little incident with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">I lived on the <span

I’ve cut out of the Jewish newspaper in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And I plucked it out of there, and it said that Ed Lessing was engaged to Carla

QUESTION:  Was it important that you both had similar experiences during the war, that she was in hiding as well, or did that -- was that not even part of the conversation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">ANSWER:  Of course, because that’s how we met. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">We met in -- We met in the Zionist organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">Both of us didn’t want to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , both of us wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I mean, all the girls, all the boys, nobody want to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , although some did, but we all wanted to get -- get the hell out, and go to the -- many went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , others went to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="701">Carla’s brother went -- helped by the Jewish Brigade to get to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> illegally. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">It was the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">We didn’t realize why it was the end, I think even. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">It’s just strange, when I think back of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">We wanted to get out. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">None of us knew the numbers, by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">None of us knew at that time that 75 percent of the Dutch Jewish population had been -- had been murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">A lot of people went on those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , and they -- yeah, well, you heard, I have an uncle, or somebody had -- that his father was killed, or -- but it didn’t form a picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">Again, the Holocaust did not exist yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">The -- The scope of this -- of this horror, was this -- was unknown to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">It had been bad, and a lot of people got killed, 1t seemed, but what can I tell you? </span><span class="sentence" id="712">That’s how I remember it, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="713">QUESTION:  So what changed? </span><span class="sentence" id="714">When did people start to see it as this [indecipherable |
ANSWER:  Well, I got to jump way ahead, but let me see. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I better stay a little bit chronologically, otherwise it doesn’t make any s -- we got married, and in 1950 we decided now was the time to go to -- to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="716">1948, the state had been declared, in 1950 we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">We left on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">LaGuardia</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> of the <span class="DLF">American export line</span> , and we had a marvelous trip across. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">We stopped in various <span class="NPIP">places</span> , Gibraltar, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paraeus</span> , and -- and we wound up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> , and Carla’s brother was there, and we went to where Carla’s brother and sister-in-law lived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dovrat</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="719">And there we lived for five years, as kibbutniks -- kibbutzniks. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Idealists. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">You didn’t make, you know, no money, and I started working at first as a blacksmith there, because I had some experience with metal working, of course, a-and later on I became a tractor driver, I had my own little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tractor</span> , and I spend most of my time spraying poisons on apples, and pears, and grapes, and -- and Carla worked in the <span class="BUILDING">children’s houses</span> , with -- with the babies, and with little children, and -- and our daughter was born in 1952, I guess, and we named her Noa, N-o-a, for figure out of the -- out of the Bible. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">And I wasn’t very happy in the kibbutz. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">I had already tasted individual life, and it was very hard to adjust. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">I had been an independent guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">When I come to think of my whole life, I’ve been -- always been more or less a -- a lo -- a -- a-- a-- a guy who did better as a -- as as -- as a loner. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">Not -- Not necessarily completely detached from life, but -- but as one who took care of himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">I took care of myself during the war, most of the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">I was not with anyone else, I was by myself, except for la -- at the end. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">Beforethat, I had two brothers, but they were eight and 10 years younger. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">They were always together, like twins, and I was by myself out there, you know, 10 years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So, I had worked in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , I had worked in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , in my own profession, and here I was a tractor driver. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">So I wasn’t too happy there. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">My daughter got sick, she got tuberculosis, which runs in the family, and almost died in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And strangely enough, we had not made any decision to go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , but it -- it happened through a bunch of strange coincidences. </span><span class="sentence" id="735">I had no family in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , none whatsoever, all my family was in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and it was quite a -- quite a group by then. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">My two brothers, my father and mother, my cousins had come over, with wives, with their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">It grew here in the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , all around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Springfield</span> , and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">And I was -- I was sitting out in -- 1- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and everybody was poor, they didn’t have money to travel to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> to -- in those days everything was different, you know, you didn’t say, “Oh well, we go, you know, spend a couple of weeks in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> ,” you know, wh-what the hell, a couple of thousand bucks, so what? </span><span class="sentence" id="739">20 dollars was a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">So, I had actually no prospect of seeing my family again. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">Carla had her brother, and an uncle, and she had some family in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , I didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">And my mother wants us -- when we -- when we left the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , Carla and I, we had asked for a re-entry permit, which you needed in those days. </span><span class="sentence" id="743">You needed a re-entry permit if you wanted to come back into the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , as a non- citizens. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">We weren’t citizens, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="745">I had sent the money to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , but the re- entry permit never came. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">Oh, we said, so what. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">It was just -- It was like a -- a -- a <span class="DLF">safety line</span> in -- in case we wouldn’t like it in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , then we could always come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">But, you know, we liked it well enough, and five years went by, and then my mother wrote. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">She said, “Did you ever get that re-entry permit?” </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And I wrote back, “No, we didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">We sent the money, but we didn’t get it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="752">She -- Well, my mother being well, my mother, immediately spoke with her senator. “</span><span class="sentence" id="753">What the hell’s going on here? </span><span class="sentence" id="754">My son sent money to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> for re-entry permit.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="755">I’1] look into it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="756">Two weeks later a letter came from the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tel Aviv</span> , that, “You are hereby requested to reapply for a visa to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ,” and I hadn’t planned to apply for a visa -- send photographs. </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And we thought, well, my daughter hadn’t been s -- been so sick, and almost died, and maybe we should go back for some time, and -- well, from there it rolled on and on and on and on. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">They needed photographs, you needed documents, you need to go to the local police to tell you that you were a good character. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">And one day a letter arrived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , and somebody in -- the letters in the kibbutz all come to the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> , and then they get distributed. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">And somebody in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> said, “Hey, I’m going to open this letter.” </span><span class="sentence" id="761">He opened our letters from the <span class="BUILDING">embassy</span> , and said, “Hey, these people are applying to go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Now, it’s hard to imagine at this point in the history of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , but then, if you left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , just leave it and go to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , you were an outcast already, sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">They would give you a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> , and two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , and 20 bucks, and goodbye Charlie, that was nice of you to be in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="764">We don’t want to have further anything to do with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">To go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where you came from, you were yuradeem. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">There are two words in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , one it <span class="DLF">alleyah</span> , which means going up, when you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , you make alleyah, you go to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , you go up. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">The word El Al comes from there, by the way, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airline</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">When you leave <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , you yurate, you go down. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">We were yuradeem, people who go down. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">It was, again the word ashander, an-and it was a terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And in the general meeting, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> , the members decided that we had no right to live there any more, even though we had worked for five years, our butts off, and all that, but -- and we had been bona fide members, they voted us out. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">But they didn’t want to throw us out right away, first -- they would throw us out as soon as I found a job, some -- outside of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">So I went, and I applied for a job, and I got a job as a draftsman, in an English company, the <span class="BUILDING">refineries</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">oil refineries</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haifa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="774">And I don’t know any more what happened, but we didn’t -- we decided that we wouldn’t stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> after all. </span><span class="sentence" id="775">However, we couldn’t go to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> either, because of my daughter’s tuberculosis that she had had. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">They took x-rays, and they said, “You'll have to wait a year.” </span><span class="sentence" id="777">In those days tuberculosis was like AIDS today. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">You had it, you didn’t get into the <span class="COUNTRY">States</span> , and that was the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">So, they said, “You'll have to wait a year.” </span><span class="sentence" id="780">And I don’t know, we decided, you know what, if we have to wait a year, let’s go to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and we’ll wait a year there, and then we’ll apply to the <span class="BUILDING">American embassy</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">And so we got on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> , and left <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> with our daughter, and went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and we lived there for one year in 1956. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">I went back to the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I had worked before as a draftsman, found out about a new profession that I had neverheard about, and immediately decided that was the profession that I wanted to learn. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">It was called industrial design. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I’d never heard of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">It was ideal for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">It was a combination of art, and technology. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Industrial designers are the people who design <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and telephones and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerators</span> , and -- in other words, people who give shape to modern industrial products. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">Anyway, we spent a year in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , had a wonderful time. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">One of the best years of our lives, I don’t know why, but it was just wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">My daughter, in quick succession, dropped her Hebrew, which she spoke fluently, and learned Dutch, and at the end of the year, when we went to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , she dropped her Dutch, and in three weeks spoke fluent English. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">So, went through three languages in no time at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">And so we got back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="793">QUESTION:  But let’s just go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> for a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Again, being identified as people who had survived the war, an-and what was t -- as you say, to later become the Holocaust, was there -- were people 1-identified in different ways, [indecipherable] didn’t feel like they were different [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">Were there conversations about that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="824">QUESTION:  Was it considered a weakness to dwell on that, or --
ANSWER:  I think it probably was. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">There -- There are many -- I mean, this is in hindsight now, of course, and I’ve heard -- we all have heard now, the stories of -- that the Holocaust survivors weren’t particularly welcome in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> after the war, because they represented defeat, and what <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> was about was victory. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">And then there were these people who kept on talking about the horrors they had seen, and nobody wanted to hear this. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">Nobody wanted to hear the stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And the hidden children -- that term by ca -- didn’t exist, of course, but those who had been in hiding, we -- when you heard a story from a -- from a Holocaust survivor who had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , you weren’t going to talk about, hey, I was in a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for two and a half years. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">They would laugh. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Nothing happened to you. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">You weren’t in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , you didn’t see anybody die, did you? </span><span class="sentence" id="832">No, but -- anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">No, it -- I guess there was something like that, but I’m not sure that that influenced us at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">We lived with a little group of o-other Dutch kibbutznikim, some of who had also gone through hiding, and we worked hard, we got children, and we didn’t talk about the war, talked about everything but the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">Talked about the crummy bastards in the kibbutz who were freeloading, on -- on us who were working so hard, and they talked about the -- the guy, the sadana witha the guy who puts you in <span class="BUILDING">work places</span> every day, and he always gave you the lousy jobs. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And talked about tractors, that they weren’t working right, or stuff like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">Years went -- went by talking about that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="855">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">We came back, and of course now we had a daughter, and I started looking around for a job, and an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and we -- we found that in the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where -- from where we are right now, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dobb’s Ferry</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And I started a job with a -- with an instrument company. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">Let’s see, a son -- we got a son. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">He was born here in the -- in here, in the <span class="REGION">area</span> , and we moved from an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dobb’s Ferry</span> to this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hastings</span> , 36 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">In the meantime, I started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> at night. </span><span class="sentence" id="861">I went to <span class="BUILDING">Pratt Institute</span> , and got a degree in Industrial design, and started working on <span class="DLF">Madison Avenue</span> , and then got laid off there, because they ran out of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">This is just about the time Kennedy got assassinated. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">And then I sort of slid into doing free lance work for myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">And life went on, and Carla started going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and she graduated, and she -- she first went -- got a Bachelors, and then she got a Master’s from <span class="BUILDING">Columbia</span> , and she became a Social Worker. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">And was all -- that was a great accomplishment for us, because we had missed our education in a sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">So now I was free-lancing, and then -- and I got a <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> for awhile, on the corner of <span class="DLF">Fifth Avenue</span> and <span class="DLF">42" Street</span> , in a prestigious <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , and a -- we were very busy, and the kids were growing up, and so on and so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I thought that our life -- my life would be pretty well without surprises further on. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">I looked at it -- I forget what birthday that was, but it’Il be my 40" -- my 40" would have -- would have been in ’66, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="869">Born in ’26. </span><span class="sentence" id="870">Anyway, somewhere, one of these birthdays, I said, “Well, I think I’ve seen it about.” </span><span class="sentence" id="871">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Sounds a little cynical, but I had a big birthday party, and at the end of the day I thought, probably it’s going to go on until my death wi -- about the same way, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="873">With working, and kids growing up and leaving the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and so on and so forth, and -- and two things happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">Actually, three things happened, but -- but the first one happened in -- let me see, I think 19 -- 19 -- 1980. [</span><span class="sentence" id="875">inaudible] 1980? </span><span class="sentence" id="876">1981. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">My wife got involved with a couple of other ladies in setting up a -- something that hadn’t been done before, a special kind of meeting of people who had been in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">And now, she was always involved in reading Holocaust literature, and especially Dutch 1s -- tr -- poetry, and stories written by Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">I never touched it. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">My brother sent me the standard work in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , about the destruction of the Dutch Jewry, a two volume book, and it stood on the shelf. </span><span class="sentence" id="881">I once looked, there were a couple of photographs in it, I was horrified, I put it back on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shelf</span> , never touched it. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">Anyway, in 1981, she started to organize this -- this business with -- but before that, there was an article in New York magazine, I’m sure she had -- she must have told you about all this -- was an article in New York magazine in which there was a- a couple of stories, a bunch of stories of -- of hidden -- what they suddenly were called, hidden children, children who had been in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">It hit the -- It hit the -- the -- the -- the - the -- the media, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="884">In short order, CBS, NBC, ABC, the magazines, Time, Idon’t know, Newsweek, everybody wanted to know -- a new buzz word there was, hidden children, who had ever heard of hidden children? </span><span class="sentence" id="885">Here we had been for 50 years surrounded -- now we -- we didn’t think about it ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">Anyway, that’s the time we got in -- we got asked to be interviewed by the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> , I guess, and in short order we -- I got onto all kinds of television programs. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">I was on CNBC, we were -- the whole family was on ABC Good Morning America, and -- it was amazing -- amazing time. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">Anyway, the conference was in sight. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">It was on Memorial Day, 1981, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">And Carla said to me, “Are you coming to this conference?” </span><span class="sentence" id="891">She had been very busy organizing this. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">I had heard the news, you know, and -- and -- and I -- I think my --  a- answer was -- is -- is a classic by now, I -- I said, “Ah no, why should I come? </span><span class="sentence" id="893">I mean, you will be busy, running around here -- there -- at the conference, and I'll just be hanging out, you know, waiting til it’s over.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="894">Well,” she said, “you know, my brother is especially coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , and he’ll be wandering around by himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="895">Couldn’t you just come?” </span><span class="sentence" id="896">And I said, “All right, all right.” </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I’ve been married for many years, you learn when to -- when to be acquiescent, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And so, there we gathered, on Memorial Day weekend, in -- on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Times Square</span> in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">Marriott</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="899">And I think it was Friday night when the first registration was supposed to be on, and I -- Carla was busy up there on the <span class="INT_SPACE">seventh floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="900">They were -- They had the -- like, sort of <span class="NPIP">places</span> where you could register. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">And I positioned myself between those <span class="DLF">windows</span> , where people stood behind them, had all these kits for they -- for those who had registered, and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="902">Nowthe <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span> 1-1-in -- in that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> are made out of glass, sort of. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">They -- They -- They rise from -- from -- from the bottom on the -- in -- in an <span class="BUILDING">atrium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="904">And then, when they come to the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , they open up, and they disgorge their people. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">And I stood there, and I watched the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">elevators</span> bringing up these people, these gray haired men and women, of all kinds of heights and sizes, and girth, and -- and then I saw them go to the -- to the <span class="DLF">windows</span> there, where the volunteers of -- were standing, and they were getting their kits, and then they got the tags, and they put the tags on, and they wrote on there where -- who they were, and where they had been in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">And I can’t -- to this day I cannot explain to you, but as they got -- started to crowd around on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and I began to read their tags, sort of furtively, you know, I wasn’t with anyone, and they began to form groups and talk, and I looked at the tags, and the tags said, I was hidden in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , I was hidden in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , I was hidden in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="907">I came from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , I came from <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="908">And this -- very strange, but I began to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="909">I began to cry, and it was to me as if I always had believed that I was the only one who had been in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">Is a thing so strange, I mean, I knew, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">I mean, my o -- my own brothers, and friends, and everybody had been -- but here they were, the hidden children, s -- 1600 of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">And they crowded around, and they talked, and I just stood and looked at them, and I cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">And they were suddenly like I had all these brothers and sisters, but of course, I had very little in common with most of them, sum -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">There was very little in common between somebody who has been in hi -- in hiding in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and somebody who has been hi -- in hiding in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> , let’s say, or in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="915">The situation w-were vastly different, but it didn’t matter. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">And the conference started up, and Carla’s brother came, and we sat in the conference, 1600 people, we listened to Abe Foxman, you know, of the Anti-Defamation League, who was a hidden child. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">And we listened to other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And I cried, and everybody cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I cried for three days. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">Something magical happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I, who had never read a book on the Holocaust, I suddenly was -- it was like, I don’t know, like my mind opened up suddenly to something that I could -- you asked me, did you t -- earlier, did you talk about the war, either in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Yor</span> -- in -- in the Zionist organization or in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">kibbutz</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="922">Never a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Carla and I didn’t talk about the war with each other. </span><span class="sentence" id="924">And it happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="925">It changed my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">I -- It went on for three days, and wherever I went, I talked with people, and they talked to me, and I got to tell you funny thing, that people never stopped talking, and they couldn’t get enough of telling what happened to them, as if they had never -- as if -- as if they had never told it to anyone, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">Or maybe they didn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">It was -- It was so bad, I stood in the <span class="INT_SPACE">men’s room</span> next to a guy -- next -- the - the guy next to me in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">urinal</span> said to me, “So, where were you in hiding?” </span><span class="sentence" id="929">And I said in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="930">I said, “So where were you in hiding?” </span><span class="sentence" id="931">He said, “I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="932">And we talked while we peed. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">And even there, you didn’t stop talking with -- and -- and [indecipherable] what happened to me, and then we zipped up, and then we talked some more <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="934">It was astounding. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">It was an astounding experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">And when it was over, three days later, we left, and it was as if I had suddenly acquired, you know, like 1600 sisters and brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">I didn’t want to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="938">Nobody wanted to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">There were people sitting downstairs in the <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span> that -- that cried because it was over. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">When you ask people today, who were at that conference, they all remember it exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">I was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I experienced it. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">It was as if the <span class="DLF">door</span> suddenly opened, after 50 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">It was as if we were suddenly allowed to remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Anyway, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , it was very strange, as -- the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> was in the <span class="BUILDING">garage</span> downstairs, as I drove out, an enormous thunderstorm broke out over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="946">The sky was blue with lightning every second, and the rain poured down, and it thundered b-between those <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , it sounded -- it was like <span class="NPIP">hell</span> had broken loose, it was like God himself sort of thundered out on -- on us for -- you know, it was very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">Got <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , started reading every -- every book, every pamphlet, every story I could lay my hands on. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">And my life changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">It -- It’s never been the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">I became a speaker, became an interviewer for a -- Spielberg’s Shoah Foundation. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">I -- I’m a-about the best speaker they have of the Hidden Child Foundation. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">I spoke last month at the commemoration at the Supreme Court of New York state, to the judges and the lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">It’s -- All this happened after that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">So --
QUESTION:  Let me ask you, based on -- on what has happened since then, and that you’ve become so involved, do you look back on all those years of not talking about it, and wonder why you and man -- and many others didn’t really discuss the story?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="955">ANSWER:  Yes, of course I have, and there’s all sorts of theories about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">If you ask Carla, who is a Social Worker, and who psychologically knows much more than I do, you heard her https://collections.ushmm.org say earlier, when we were talking about it, briefly, about needing four decades to -- to be able to talk about it, but that -- that still doesn’t -- I still don’t understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">But th-the experience is -- I’m not the only one. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">There are so many who said -- I’ve interviewed people myself, not hidden children, but the camp survivors, who said, “Ah, Mr. Lessing, this is the first time that I will be speaking about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">I’ve never spoken about it like this with anyone else.” </span><span class="sentence" id="960">What is it? </span><span class="sentence" id="961">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">I -- I -- Really, I’m stupid, as far as that’s concerned, I have -- I have no idea why it took 50 years for me, but it -- for me there was a definite epiphany, that -- that moment there, I could look, I could take you to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> on that <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">Marriott Marquis</span> on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Times Square</span> , and say, here’s where I stood. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">Here is where suddenly everything changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">No, no, come back in another 10 years, maybe Ill have an answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">Maybe Carla had an answer, I’m not quite sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">Anyway, I became quite active, slowly, not -- not immediately, but Carla, of course, had the -- became vice-president of The Hidden Child Foundation, and I -- I began to -- and she formed a group here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Westchester</span> , and I decided that my forte was maybe writing some things, I have written little pieces, and I began to write a newsletter, every month I write a newsletter, there’s only two pages, but I love to write a little editorial for it, and I’ve written those, and -- and then later I started a newsletter, same thing, two page newsletter for The Hidden Child Foundation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and that has a circulation of about 3,000 people, and that goes around, you know, the -- the whole <span class="REGION">New York region</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="967">That’s my involvement, and the speaking -- the speaking involvement is much more intense. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">I spoke to, I don’t know, maybe 15 - 20 <span class="NPIP">places</span> this -- during the Holocaust commemoration season, you know, these -- these speech days come in seasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">Anyway, that was one -- one thing that changed my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">Now, I got to go to something very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">That was in 19 -- was that 1990, or 1991, the big [inaudible] 1991 -- 1981, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">In 1982, there was a decision that in -- of the Dutch Jews, that they would hold a conference for hidden children in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="973">And of course we were invited to come, and of course we decided, you know, we were hidden children from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , so Carla and I decided yes, we will go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Okay, tickets, airline tickets and so on, so forth, and -- about two months before -- about two months er -- before the conference, I decided that -- are you comfortable? </span><span class="sentence" id="975">You could lean back, maybe, if that’s easier for you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="976">QUESTION:  No, that’s fine.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="977">ANSWER:  Are you okay?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="978">QUESTION:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="979">ANSWER:  About a month and a half, or two months before conference in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , I suddenly decided that I had actually never said enough -- given enough thanks to one man in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , who had helped me save my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">I don’t know if you remember I talked to you about a police officer, Oskam, a great model of a naz -- Dutch Nazi, but he was really a wonderful guy. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">I thought, I wonder if Oskam is still li -- I didn’t know his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">I wonder if that police officer is still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="983">And I couldn’t find his name in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">I asked my brother Fred, who did all the interviews, he said, “Yeah, something like <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boscamp</span> , or something like that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="985">Anyway, I sent a letter to the Bureau of War dec -- documentation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> , and said -- described the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> where I had been, and described Oskam, and I sent a little picture, a little photograph of Oskam, his wife, and their son, who was then three and a half, four years old, and sent it off to war document -- and asked them, is Mr. Oskam -- Mr. Boscamp, or whatever his name 1s still alive, and I described him. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">And I got a letter back that said, “No, we’re sorry, but that gentleman has died, and so -- his wife has also died. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">But his son, Oskam junior is still alive, and he’s a retired plumber, and we sent your letter with the photograph, on to him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="988">So I got a letter back from Oskam, junior. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">And he said, “Mr. Lessing, I don’t know who you are, but I’m very grateful for the little photograph you sent me, I’ve never seen that photograph.” </span><span class="sentence" id="990">Of course he hadn’t, because I had taken it just before I left for the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="991">And he said, “What can I do for you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="992">And I said to him, “I’m sorry your father died, but I would like to, when I come to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> for the conference, I would like to get together with you, and talk about your father, he -- who saved my life, you know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="993">And I got a letter back from him, it said, “Well listen, I was only four -- four, four and a half years old, and I don’t know much. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">My father was a very closed man. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">I -- I don’t know what to -- what I could tell you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="996">And I said, “I don’t really care, but I would like to find out a little bit about your father, who was he, what -- what background did he come from.” </span><span class="sentence" id="997">Suddenly, I- it had to do with the whole hidden children business, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">Suddenly I decided I must find out about what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">I must find out what happened to all the Jews during the Holocaust, and here was a chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">So I wrote to him, we’re coming to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , and can we meet with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">And he said, “Yeah, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">I don’t know what I can do for you, but okay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">We go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , and we are 10 minutes away from Amsterdam airport Schiphol, and the captain comes on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">As they always do, it’s, “Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for flying KLM, we’ll be landing in 10 minutes in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schiphol</span> , and don’t forget any of your stuff,” whatever, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">And I burst out in crying -- crying, next to Carla. </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">I’m sobbing sitting there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">She said, ““What happened, what’s the matter?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">I said, “This shit makes no sense at all, but when we land, when this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> land in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Schiphol</span> , I see at the end of the <span class="DLF">runway</span> , there’s a <span class="DLF">line</span> of black <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , with SS, waiting for me, and they will kill me.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">A direct remembrance of the morning of the raid in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">And she said, “Well, you know that that’s not true.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">I said, “I know that’s not true,” but that’s how I felt it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">It was like -- It was like I was right back there, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">Well, we wer -- We landed, of course, and my cousin was there with her little blue <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Honda</span> , and of course the SS disappeared from my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">Anyway, the next day we meet Oskams, junior. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">By this time I found out the name is Oskam, not Boscamp, and Oskam ju -- Oskam junior, who doesn’t look at all like his father, but he looks like his mother, you know, have a round face, and round body, and very jolly guy, and he’s a retired plumber, and then we meet him in this tiny little doll’s <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , like they have in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">The whole <span class="BUILDING">house</span> fits about in this -- in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">And they have the coffee, and the cake, as always in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , you know, you have to eat coffee, and you know, and big cakes with great almond paste in it, lovely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">And we sitting down, and we meet his wife, and -- so he said, “What can I do for you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">I said, “Well I -- I didn’t know who your father was, really, because it was all so secret.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And he tells me a little bit about his father, and it comes out that Oskam came from a family of all Nazis, Dutch Nazis, and bad ones, anti-Semites. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">People who tried to discover where Jews were hidden, and found them, and -- and denounced them to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">The worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">The whole family was one big heap of garbage, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">He was the only good one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">But because the whole family was so bad, his reputation was -- was bad -- for the Germans was excellent, because he came from this virulent Nazi family, they thought he was so too, and when -- when I show you a picture of him, he looks like it, like a Nazi in black uniform, and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">He was a good man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">Anyway, we’re talking, and he tells me about this br -- his father, and then -- and then I said, “Listen, did you know there was a <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> not far from here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">And he said, “Yes, I -- I knew that, my father told me that.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">I said, “Did you know who was in the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">He said, “No, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">My father didn’t tell me too much about it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">I said, “You didn’t know that I was in there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">He said, “No, I -- I don’t.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">He said to me, “Why are you asking me these questions?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">I said, “Well, I had this crazy idea,” -- all this comes after the revelations in 1991, the conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">I -- I had to find out everything now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">I said, “I thought if maybe there were a group of men in there, and I probably saw them for the last time when they were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">And I thought maybe a brother or a sister, or maybe even a father or a mother might still be alive, and I could tell them at least, for that last morning, when we ran into the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> and warned them, and,” -- and he’s listening to me, and he says to me, “But Mr. Lessing, I just want to tell you something wrong with your story.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Is -- And I thought, “What the hell does he know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">He was four years old at the time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">I-I -- I said, “What do you mean there’s something wrong with my story?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">He said, “Well, I don’t know much what happened there,” he said, “but I know one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">Nobody was arrested that morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">They all escaped.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">Now, you’ve got to realize, for 50 years I have lived with the idea, on and off, not every day, not every week, but at least once a month, I would think about the morning of the raid on the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , and how we stormed in, my buddy and I, and warned the men, and pulled the blankets off them, and shouted, “It’s a raid, it’s the SS, get up, the Germans are here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">And then, when we saw that they were all up and out and awake, we fled. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">And always the question came up, we should have stayed, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">We should have stayed with them, helped them more. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">But then it went in my mind, then, not the seven that were there, but we would have been caught, too, and we’d have been killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">This way, there were seven killed, at least two escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">And that went on through the years, this feeling of guilt that we -- I didn’t stay long enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1052">I should have spent more time there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">I -- I -- So what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">I might have been killed with them, but -- but then that didn’t make any sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">We did warn them, and you know, and we did our best, and so we couldn’t help it, you know, this kind of stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">And here this man tells me they all escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">So instead of being guilty of maybe not doing enough, it now comes out, I’ve actually saved their lives, or helped save their lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">So, I https://collections.ushmm.org come out of that conference with this man -- this man, and my cousin is there, and she says, “So, how was it?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">I said, “You can’t -- I can’t believe this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">The men whom I thought were killed, all survived.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1061">God,” she says, “that’s amazing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">Who were they?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">I said, “He didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">I don’t know either.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">By the way, I should backtrack for one second. </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">At the beginning of the conference of my talk -- it is not a conference, but a talk with -- with Oskam junior, he said, “Mr. Lessing, I went into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> to see if there’s anything I could find on my father, and you know, there were thousands of paper my father had gathered through the years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">They were all the old tickets that he had given to people,” you know, where you don’t have a -- you don’t have a na -- an a -- license plate in the back of your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , or people didn’t have a | -- a light on the front of their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and there were thousands of those tickets, or copies of tickets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And he said, “I threw all those away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">I saved a few things,” and he came up with a picture. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1070">But,” he says, “I have something here, and it had -- was sent to my father by your mother.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">I said, “My mother? </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">From where?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">He says, “I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">It looks like from <span class="REGION">Africa</span> someplace. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">Algiers?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">He fishes out -- now this is 1992 I’m talking about, so it’s seven years ago, he digs out of there a postcard sent by my mother, to his father, saying that she came out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , she doesn’t know what’s the mat -- what -- what happened to her husband and s -- and her -- and her three sons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">She wonder if they’re still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">Would he know something more? </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">And he hands me this postcard, it was like a postcard you get after somebody dies, and it reaches you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">It wasn’t addressed to me, but it was my https://collections.ushmm.org mother’s, she had written it, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">She had typed it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">office typewriter</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">I have it here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">That’s how it started out already. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">He says, “This something that interests you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">I said, ““What do you mean it interests me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">This is from my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">She sent it after she came out of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bergen-Belsen</span> , she,” -- I don’t know, it’s amazing, anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">You see, life was full of surprises, and -- so anyway, as I said, my cousin said, “Do you know who was in the c -- in -- in that <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> ?’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">I said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">She said to me, “You know, there’s a radio program on here, comes on once a week, on Friday morning, it’s called Address Unknown, goes on the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic radio station</span> , and they interview people, there’s a guy who interviews people, and -- who are sic -- looking for people they have lost years ago.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">I said, “Yeah, well, you know, I lost people 50 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">Sh -- Who the hell would know?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">And she said, “Oh, you could try.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1094">So I call up the <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> , and I got a -- got the producer on the phone, and -- very nice lady, and she said -- I told -- I told her a little bit about this story, and she said, “That’s a fascinating story, Mr. Lessing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">Are you going to be here next month?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1096">I said, “No, I -- I’m here just for a conference, I’m -- got to go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">And, she said, “Ah, that’s too bad, because it takes us about a month to put program together, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">We have already,” and so on, so forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">You probably know all about this, and -- okay, we went to the conference -- there’s something else I didn’t tell you, and I should tell you about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">I don’t -- End of Tape Three, Side A Beginning Tape Three, Side B https://collections.ushmm.org
QUESTION:  This is a continuation of the interview with Ed Lessing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">This 1s tape three, side B. You were just talking about going back to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1102">ANSWER:  I said, “No, I have to go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">And we went to the conference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">We went to visit a lady in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brussels</span> who was -- played a part in a friend of mine’s life, and- which I haven’t told you about, and I sort of should backtrack on that later, because it’s an important part also, what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">Anyway, we go to the conference, we come back to my cousin again, who lives in the center of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">She lives, by the way, very close to where I had been in hiding in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , and where Oskam junior lives, that’s all around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Utrecht</span> , the <span class="REGION">area</span> they’re in now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">So, she says, “Call the <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> , they’ve been calling here all -- all -- all the time.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">So I call them up, I get the producer upon the phone. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1109">Yeah, Mr. Lessing, we -- we -- we decided that your story is so fascinating. </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">Could you come next Friday morning?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">I said, “Sure.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">So, Friday morning very early, Carla and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> , and my cousin went also with us, and -- and I said to my -- said, “Carla,” I said, “this is a waste of time,” sit -- sitting there talking about something that happened 50 years ago, who the hell would remember an obscure <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> in an obscure piece of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> somewhere in an obscure little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">You’re going to get that on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">So -- But we were there, and there’s a guy, he was sort of like -- you could say a little bit like, oh, the Letterman of the -- of the Dutch air waves, a very popular man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">Hans Frombilihamber, Hans Frombilihamber, should put his name in here. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And Hans seats me there, sits me down, and this is an hour program. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">They make a break after the half hour, and then they gave our telephone number, and then people can call in if they have any -- have any [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">Anyway, he interviews me, and I tell him the story about the hiding in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and the -- the raid, and I tell him about finding Oskam junior back, and about the terrible surprise, or the wonderful surprise, to find out that I didn’t -- what say -- did do enough, that I helped those people -- to save seven people, to save their lives, and -- and -- and he makes a break, and they play some music, and then the program goes on, and at the end, he says, “Well, thank you very much,” and he -- “Pll show you where we have the telephone.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">So we go back to a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and they have a dozen telephones there, and they have six people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">And they do this every week, by the way, it’s been going on for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">There’s six people, they take the telephone calls, and they write on slips whatever call comes in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">And so, I come there, and these dozen phones are ringing off the hook. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">And they’ve got a little stack of slips already this big. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">And they ask me, you know, as it goes on, as they’re writing it, “Is this something?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">And they hold it in front of me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And there was very strange things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">There’s a -- “Yes, my -- my sister was in there, in the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> with a dog,” You know, I -- there’s all kinds of stupid things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">But, there was one -- th-there were several that were very interesting, one -- once -

<p><span class="sentence" id="1161">QUESTION:  Can you describe it for me?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1162">ANSWER:  Well, what you’re seeing here is -- looking at the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk beds</span> , the upright posts are made from pine trees that were cut by the men, and you can see there’s an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">upper bunk</span> , somebody’s si-sitting on there eating a sandwich, and there’s a lower <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , where somebody’s eating an apple, or something like that, and I’m leaning against one of the posts of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> , in shorts, and a woolen jacket, and I’m looking directly into the camera. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">I’m the -- this man that I was talking with, had taken this photograph. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">It was taken in the fall of 1943, before the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> was raided. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">Now, I said to Lou -- and he described all the men, and their names. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">So now I knew who had been in the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">And then I ask him the final question, I said, “Lou, everything is revealed except one thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">Who was my buddy, who was my partner that morning, who stood guard with me that morning, who escaped? </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">Who was the man who my mother gave her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> to, and -- and the flashlight?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">And he said, “I don’t know, don’t you know?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">I said, “No.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">He said, “Don’t you remember https://collections.ushmm.org anything of him?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">I said, “I seem to remember a man who was a shoemaker in the regular life.”’ </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">And he said, ““Oh, well, he wasn’t a shoemaker, his father was a shoemaker, and his name was,” -- I said, ““What was his name?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">He says, “His name was Jan Carman, Jan Carman.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">So now I knew who had been my buddy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">I said, “Where is he, what happened to him?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">He said, “Ed, I don’t think you’re -- it can be, because Jan Carman was with me that morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">We fled together.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">I said, “Lou, it can’t be, he was with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">I think your memory must be mixed up.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">He said, “Well, maybe it is, you know, it’s years ago, and I’m old, and,” -- I said, “What happened to Jan Carman?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">He said, “He was with me three weeks later, we were raided in -- in unrelated raid on a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> with Jews, and he was- he was taken, and he was executed in the <span class="DLF">dunes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">And he 1s buried in the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> for the martyrs, the -- of the Resistance, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holland</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">So the picture changed again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">The man who were de -- who I thought were dead, were -- had -- had lived, the two who had escaped, one -- one had been caught, and was -- was executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">So, with that, I went one more -- once more back with -- with Oskam junior, to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">And then I knew 50 years had gone by, because where there had been an impenetrable wood of young pine <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> , now there was a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> you could look right through, with tall <span class="ENV_FEATURES">pine trees</span> , and you could walk right through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">It poured that morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">It rained cats and dogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">I had a yellow slicker, and one of these plastic coats over me, and it poured, it was a dismal day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">And we went to where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hut</span> had been, and the only thing there was was a slight depression in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">I tried to find a splinter of wood, a little piece of glass, https://collections.ushmm.org something to take back, and there was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">And then finally he took me to the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> , where I stood that morning and watched the Germans come, and I stood there in the rain, and they distanced themselve a little bit -- there was some more people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">There were people from the -- the -- the <span class="BUILDING">nursing home</span> next door. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">Anyway -- and I stood there, at the same <span class="NPIP">place</span> where I had stood that -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">And you know, it’s weird, and it sound very dramatic, but it -- I stood there, and it was almost as if I could hear tires coming up again, up on the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">It was scary, it was scary being there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">Must have been a little bit like Holocaust survivors going back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , you know’? </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">Anyway, there is -- there’s too much to tell, because it’s all in little details, there -- the ones who had given us food during the days when we were in the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , were the nuns next door. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">Next to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> was a <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and then next to that, there was a -- what do they call that, where nuns live?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1202">QUESTION:  A <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1203">ANSWER:  The <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">And the sisters at the <span class="BUILDING">convent</span> , every day put food next to the <span class="DLF">fence</span> , and we had cut a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in it, and I would -- was one of the persons who was designated to bring the food to the <span

here,” and they Slapped her in the face, and she fell on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> , and they walked right over her, and threw her in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> for three months, also. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">And Oskam, the policeman, was found walking around with a gun, which he was allowed to have, but in civilian clothes, because he had heard about the raid. </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">And they took him in for awhile, he came back three weeks later, emaciated, and beaten up, and all this stuff was coming out of what had happened that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">Anyway, it was time to go back to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">I came -- I had -- I had a bunch of photographs from Lou, and I had made a whole slew of new friends from the <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> , and -- and from, you know, the people, and it was all wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">And so Carla and I went back, and I settled down here, in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and I’m sitting right here working, in December, 1992, I get a call. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1215">Hi, this is Hans Frontikel in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , from the <span class="BUILDING">radio station</span> , remember me, I’m -- I interviewed you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">I said, “Yeah, how you doing, Hans?” ‘</span><span class="sentence" id="1217">Fine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">I wonder if you could come to <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , I have a TV program, and we’re going to do a half an hour on the -- the Dutch Resistance, and also about the Jewish persecution, and I thought you, being involved in both, maybe I could interview you again, but now on television.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">I said, “Yeah, well that’s very nice, but I don’t have a budget to go for 20 minutes to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Amsterdam</span> .” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1220">Oh no,” he said, “we pay your flight, and we pay your hotelsand everything.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">I said, “I'll be there.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">And so all of a sudden I found myself back in s -- in December, and this is what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">H-Hans, my interviewer send his -- wh-what is it called, his -- the guy you -- an -- an editor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">Tall guy, and he said, “Ed, I would like to go over the story once more with you, just quickly, for the interview, the day after tomorrow.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">I said, “Okay.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">I said, “First of all,” -- no, I -- I -- I -- I said, “Okay, but,” I said, “you know the story.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1227">Yeah, we sed -- like to -- tell me a little bit shortly, again.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">And so I said, “Well,” [indecipherable], it was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , and [indecipherable] you know, and we got raided, and I was -- was out with a buddy, and” -- and he said, “Do you know who your buddy was?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1229">I said, “Well, I didn’t know in August, but now I’ve heard that it was a cert -- a -- a certain Jan Carman.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">And they said, “What happened to him?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">And he said -- I -- I -- Is -- I said, ““He was shot in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">dunes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">He 1s buried, and,” I said, “I visited his <span class="DLF">grave</span> yesterday.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">I had in the mean time, gone to the <span class="DLF">graveyard</span> of the Resistance people, and there I cried over Jan’s <span class="DLF">grave</span> , and -- and -- Tong was his name, Tong, the editor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">He said, “Okay,” he said, “now, the day after tomorrow, Ill come and pick you up, and first we’ll go to the <span class="BUILDING">museum</span> of the Dutch Resistance.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">I said, “Oh.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1236">Oh,” he said, “well, I want to show you a film there, and,” -- okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">So, we went there, and I sat there, and this was in the former <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , and so I sat there, and I watched this film, which seemed like an old film, it didn’t seem -- I said, ““Why are you showing me this?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1238">Well,” he said, “I was told to do this,” and I couldn’t figure it out, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">Anyway, when it was over, we went to the <span class="BUILDING">TV studio</span> , and there on the set was a nice https://collections.ushmm.org thick <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> , and on the end of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">couch</span> was a little Christmas tree, cause the program was going to be aired on -- on Christmas day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">And it was a live audience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">Oskam junior and his wife was there, and my cousin with her husband were there, and as -- my second cousin from -- from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">The Hague</span> come over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">And I was alone, Carla hadn’t come with me ya -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">So, the lights went on, and there was Hans with a nice Christmas tie, and me, in little -- nice little Jewish boy, sitting next to a Christmas tree. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">So, by then I had been on TV a couple of times, and I had some idea, you know, I was here on channel 13, and I’ve been there with CNBC, and a couple other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , and -- and so I sort of knew what the routine was, you know, and the interviewer asks the questions, and you give the right answers, you know, and don’t embarrass anybody, and you don’t be idiot, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">So, he said, “Mr. Lessing, many will remember you from this summer, when I interviewed you on radio, but now here you are again, and I want to ask you a few questions.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1246">And so he asked me where I was during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1247">I said I was in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1248">And where were you in hiding? </span><span class="sentence" id="1249">I -- Well, I was, among other <span class="NPIP">places</span> , was in this <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1250">And what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="1251">Well, we were raided. </span><span class="sentence" id="1252">And -- And the interview went along fine, you know, standardized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1253">By then I got a little bit, shall I say, blas¢é about the whole thing, you know”? </span><span class="sentence" id="1254">But it was fun to be there, and -- and he said, “So, Mr. Lessing, what happened?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1255">I said, “Well, we stood guard, a buddy of mine, and -- and -- and I, and we happened to see the Germans coming, and we went back and warned the others, and,” -- he said, “Do you know who your buddy was?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1256">I said, “Well yes, he is Jan Carman, and he -- I visited his <span class="DLF">grave</span> yesterday, and he got executed by the Germans, near the dunes in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1257">And then he said something that did not fit in the thing, and he said, “Mr. Lessing, I want to tell you that we have received a part of a diary of the man -- your buddy, your partner who stood guard with you that morning, describing that morning, the raid, and everything, just like you tell it.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1258">And I thought for a second, and I thought, he is wrong, that can’t be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1259">Cause Jan Carman’s date on his <span class="DLF">grave</span> says he was -- he was executed in February, 1945 -- 1944, and we were raided on the 29" of December, 1943. </span><span class="sentence" id="1260">There had only been a couple of weeks in between, and he was on the run all the time, I knew that from Lou. </span><span class="sentence" id="1261">So I thought this -- something -- something is screwed up here, and -- but, you know, live audience, you’re not going to -- so I said, “Oh.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1262">And then he said something that really chilled me to the bone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1263">He said, “Mr. Lessing, I want to tell you that the man who was with you that morning, who stood guard with you then, was here -- is here to talk with you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1264">And I became ice cold, and I thought, I just visited his <span class="DLF">grave</span> , and the dead don’t rise from the <span class="DLF">grave</span> , and -- and he is so fucked up here, you know with this, I’m sorry, excuse my language, but I didn’t know what to think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1265">And a light went on on the far end of the stage, and this man walks out, tall man, who I’d seen in the photographs, who was described to me as the man who lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1266">And out walks this man, Herman Mueninghof. </span><span class="sentence" id="1267">And he walks over to me, and he grabs my hand, and he said, “Eddie, I’m so glad you’re alive.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1268">And I said, “Herman, it’s wonderful.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1269">I said, “What are you doing here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1270">He said, “The TV people brought me here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">I said, “All the way https://collections.ushmm.org from <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1272">I said, “What do you do there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1273">He said, “I’m a Catholic bishop, and I live in <span class="REGION">New Guinea</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1274">I said, “But why are you here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">He said, “They wanted me to meet you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">I said, “That’s wonderful,” I said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">He said, “You don’t seem to remember that -- how we stood guard together that morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">You don’t -- don’t you remember how we -- how your mother saved our lives? </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">How your mother, that night, gave me her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and the flashlight?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">And all of a sudden I realized I was wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1281">It -- It wasn’t the other man, it was this man, this bishop, this Catholic bishop, Herman Mueninghof. </span><span class="sentence" id="1282">And again the picture changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1283">The -- Again we -- the two of -- two of us had survived, and the others had survived also, the only one who had not survived was this poor Jan Carman, who had been in the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , who I had remembered vaguely. </span><span class="sentence" id="1284">And we talked, and we cried, and this just -- I said -- he said to me, “Your mother saved -- saved our lives.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1285">I said, “Yes, I know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1286">He said, “No, you don’t.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1287">I said, ““What do you mean I don’t?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1288">He said, “Do you remember how your mother gave me her <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , and a little flashlight?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1289">I said, “Yes, I do remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1290">You went out, you -- you pedaled away in -- in the darkness.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1291">He said, “I hadn’t gone more than two minutes away when a German sprang out in the middle of -- of the <span class="DLF">road</span> -- the <span class="DLF">path</span> , and said, halt, get off the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , stand against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1292">There was a little <span class="BUILDING">pumphouse</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1293">He said, “And I stood against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , with my face to the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , and he frisked me from top to bottom, to feel if I had any weapons. </span><span class="sentence" id="1294">If your mother hadn’t told us to bury the weapons that we had, our -- our nine millimeter Mausers,” he said, “they would have shot me, probably, on -- on the spot.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">I said, “What happened then?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">He said, “I don’t know where I got the guts, but I said, what are you doing? </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">Why are you stopping me like this?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">And the German said, “I know you’re one of these -- these terrorists from the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">And Herman said, “What <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">I don’t know any <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">What are you talking about?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1302">And he said, “Yes, don’t deny it, you’re one of the terrorists from the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">We have orders to arrest you all, and we’ll get you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">He said, “I have no idea what y, -- he said, “I come from <span class="BUILDING">night school</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">He says, “You come from <span class="BUILDING">night school</span> , what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">Where <span class="BUILDING">night school</span> ?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">He says, “I come from <span class="BUILDING">night school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zeist</span> , and,” -- he said, “What are you studying there?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">He said, “I’m studying to be a Notary Public,” which was true, Herman was studying to be a Notary Public. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">And he said -- and he said, “I felt that the guy, what he really wanted, was the little flashlight.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">Now this wasn’t an ordinary flashlight, 1t was something that was worth gold in the last -- in -- during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">It was made by Philips. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">It was a little hand generator, you squeezed it, and 1t made light. </span><span class="sentence" id="1313">And in a time that there were absolutely no batteries any more, these things were worth gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">People would buy -- pay hundreds of gilders to get one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">And the guy wanted this, you know, it was worth something to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">And Herman was very smart, he says, “I thought that if he arrested me, he would have to hand everything over to his superior officer, but if he let me go, he could keep the flashlight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">So he -- I said to him, give me the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> is no good to you, it’s solid tires.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">He said, “What I -- M-My mother is waiting with dinner, you know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">And he said, “I could see the guy thinking, and then he said, “Nah, alza gazie, go.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">And he said, “I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , and I pedaled away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">And if it hadn’t beenfor your mother telling us to drop the weapons and bury them,” he says, “I wouldn’t be here.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">Another surprise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">There was no end to the -- to the surprises.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1324">QUESTION:  Let me ask you some general questions, because it’s interesting how you talk about the picture changing, and even over the last 10 years, all this information that you’ve now learned from, you know, about ha -- what happened 50 years ago, can you just talk just generally about what it’s been like for the last decade, to revisit the history, and have it all change, you know, fill in all those <span class="DLF">holes</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="1327">ANSWER:  It’s a little bit like being hungry, and never really having enough to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">It’s a weird thing to say, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">I am daily still trying to find out what happened, not exactly to me, but what happened to -- to the Dutch Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">I read articles, I -- my cousin send -- the same cousin with her little blue <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Honda</span> , sends me, almost weekly, articles from the Dutch newspapers describing the things that had happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">The money that’s missing, the paintings that were stolen. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">The -- The archive of -- of -- of -- of name cards that was found recently, abandoned by the Dutch government, somewhere in -- in it -- on the <span class="INT_SPACE">third floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">All these things still are filling out my picture of what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , to the Dutch Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">Every new book that comes out, I immediately buy, and they send me from <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , in Dutch, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">That story seems to never be completely https://collections.ushmm.org complete. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">There’s always new -- seem to be new little things coming out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">Because it’s impossible to remember two and a half years, every minute of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">So, I found out some of the things, and -- and -- but there’s still the desire to find out exactly where was I, what did I think, what happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">It’s an ongoing thing, it will go on til the end of my life now, because the -- the -- the clarific -- it -- 1t’s like -- it’s like troubled water that slowly becomes clarified, more and more and more and more, who we were then, what we were, what we did, why did I do this, why did I? </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">So, that’s the best that I can tell you, it -- itis a need to find out, still. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">And it all started in that God damn moment there, on that <span class="INT_SPACE">seventh floor</span> of that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">It all started there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">It’s very strange. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">It was time to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">I got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">plane</span> , very, very tired, because so much has been revealed to me now again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">And I got back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">JFK</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">JFK airport</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and Carla was waiting for me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">And she said, “Well, how did it go?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">I said, “I got to tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">It’s very strange, but for a Jewish boy like me, has now ha -- I have a friend who 1s a Catholic bishop in <span class="REGION">New Guinea</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Indonesia</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">I subsequently asked Herman to send me the complete diary, and when I got it there were pages missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">And I send him a letter, and I said -- I call him Herman, I don’t -- don’t call him Your Holiness, or Your Worship, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">Or bishop. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">And I said, “Herman, where are the pa -- missing pages, again?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">He said, “There were things in there that were not so nice.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">I said, “I don’t care. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">I want -- would like to know.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">And he send me the pages. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">There were remarks made by the members of the Resistance in the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , about Jews not being reliable enough, you couldn’t trust them with https://collections.ushmm.org your life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">I mean, this is -- this is ironic. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">They had this 17 year old Jewish kid, he was not in the Resistance, he was just in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">They didn’t really want him in the <span class="BUILDING">hut</span> , but Oskam, who was very influence -- influential in that <span class="REGION">area</span> for the Resistance, and he was pivotal for them, had asked them to take in this Jewish kid, and so they had to take him in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">But it wasn’t -- there were several members who said, “Well, we ca -- we can’t really trust him, you know?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">What is so superiorally ironic is that I later on saved the God damn lives of these men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">I mean, it’s interesting how things evolve. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">Let me see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">You don’t want to go forever with this -- with this -- are you running out of tape?</span></p>

QUESTION:  This is the continuation of an interview with Ed -- with Ed Lessing, and this is tape four, side A. And we were just going to talk in general, sort of, thinking about how you’re a different person than you might have been without the experiences you went through during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">Let’s first start in terms of religion, cause you had mentioned during -- during the war that you had made that promise to continue -- you made a promise to God to continue with religion, I wonder if you’d talk about that, a-and how that didn’t work out.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1370">ANSWER:  They say that in the -- in the first World War, I guess, that in the <span class="DLF">trenches</span> , every -- every soldier becomes religious, and prays. </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">And in a sense that’s, I guess, what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">And my mother would have certainly approved of it when I s -- when I said that -- I promised God that I would try to keep his -- the laws he had given to Moses on <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mount Sinai</span> , and in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">desert</span> , that I would follow them all my life, if he would just spare my family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">And they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">And I held on for years afterward, in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I would -- I had my own kind of Jewish religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">On Yom Kippur, I would take a prayer book -- no, I wouldn’t -- not -- not a prayer book, I would take the Old Testament, and I would go out to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Hudson river</span> , and I’d sit there all day long, and I’d fast, and I read. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">I read about the Jews, and their history, and the battles, and King David, and King Solomon, and all the wonderful stories of the Old Testament, and of my people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">But at -- again, as I began to find out what the Holocaust really had -- had been, it all seemed -- religion seemed like a farce. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">God had taken his own people, and murdered one and a half -- let the Germans murder one and a half million of his own children, little children, innocents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">It didn’t make any sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">Like so many other Holocaust survivors, I guess, there was no thinking of God after <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">And so I slowly, slowly left it all. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">I became -- I read more, and more, and more, and none -- none of it pointed to the existence of -- of God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">It all pointed out to the -- to the terrible things that human beings can do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">So, religion became not important any more to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">What did become more and more important, though, is the fate of the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">I am very fervent in my defense of the j -- of the Jewish people, as a most marvelous, marvelous people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">Difficult people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">Moses knew that already, goes up for a couple of days on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountains</span> , come back, and they already screwed it up, they made a golden calf. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">There’s a lesson there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">I mean, the J-Jews are difficult, and they are impossible, but they’re also genius, they are the salt of the earth. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">And to me, the Jewish people in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , they’re -- our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , I mean, this is all miraculous, after 2,000 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">Jews have waited for this, and we’ve got a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">And I thank God. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">We have worked -- We have gone there for five years at least, and given our lives to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">It was well worth it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396">So, religion is sort of evolved into a fervent nationalism, and -- and a defense of the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">I will accept no blame whatsoever to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , what they do, or whatever they do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">It’s -- I’m like the old fashioned English -- Englishman, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">My <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> - Or maybe it was an American, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">I think it was an Englishman who said, my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> right or wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">To me, the -- the security of the Jewish people is uppermost, and https://collections.ushmm.org it sounds horrendous, but if it would be necessary to throw every Arab out of -- out of <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> in order to secure it’s -- it’s -- the safety of it’s people, I’d say, don’t hesitate, do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">We have suffered for 2,000 years, murder and mayhem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">I mean hangings, burnings, it’s horrible, the whole Jewish history is -- is one of -- of -- of suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">Enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">Now it’s our time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">And so, I guess, my religion became really my love for -- for my people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">And it’s difficult sometimes you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">I -- We had to -- Carla has two grand -- had a grandnephew here, very nice young man who worked for the <span class="BUILDING">Israeli embassy</span> here, and he came with his girlfriend, and they stayed here for three months upstairs in a little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">And we had this -- we had this conversation, and they said, “Oh, we don’t -- we don’t give a damn for politics in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> , it’s horrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">We don’t want to know anything about politics, and we don’t want to -- and I think we should give the <span class="REGION">land</span> back to the -- to the - to the Palestinians, or whoever, and th-the Syrians, and -- and we don’t want to be involved in this.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">And I -- These were the people I admire, these are the sabbers, the people who are born there, and I said, “Let me tell you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">Let me give you at least a view of a Holocaust survivor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">We had no <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , we had nowhere to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">There was no way out, they murdered us by the millions.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">I said, “The Jewish people suffered unbelievably, [indecipherable]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">Now there’s a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and you are our hope.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">I said, “The first thing for us as -- as survivors, is a Security, a safe haven, where Jews can go, where Jews can be defended. </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">So don’t say that you’re not interested, please.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">And they understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">So, I don’t know if that’s an answer for your question, but that’s as close as I can come. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">Religion is no longer of an -- any importance to me at this point, but the fate of my people is, very much so.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Family doctor?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1451">ANSWER:  Yeah, family doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1452">In <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> they say your house doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="1453">Every once in awhile I catch myself with these Dutch translations. </span><span class="sentence" id="1454">And he said, “Well, you know you -- you have to get an -- undergo a G.I. series, you -- you have like ulcer symptoms, you may have an ulcer. </span><span class="sentence" id="1455">Anyway, it came out I didn’t have an ulcer yet, but I was very close, and he said -- he recommended that I go to a <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> nearby, where it -- for very cheap, and you could get therapy, you know, but -- and it was -- c-could be seen by a -- so I contacted a -- a doctor there, and he said -- and when he found out that I was a Holocaust survivor -- that was just sort of be -- people began to be aware that there was something special with people who have come through that, and -- and I started going every -- once a week to this -- to this <span class="BUILDING">clinic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1456">Unfortunately, after awhile, that doctor couldn’t see me any more, but he recommended me to another doctor, Doctor Hillel Swiller, and I went to him for about -- one of the first sessions I had with him, I said, “Look, I want to tell you something doctor,” I said, “I am not one of these guys who believes in going for years and years and years into psychotherapy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1457">I see it more or less, exactly the way, if I break a leg, I go to a doctor, and he puts a cast around it, and then like a month later, or you know, whenever, two months later, the cast comes off, andthat’s the end of it, you know?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1458">Well, that was 23 years ago, and -- and I don’t go now any more, I -- but he totally changed me, because I was a very angry person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1459">I can still get very angry, but at least I -- I calm down again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1460">I was very depressed, <span class="DLF">skies</span> were gray all the time, and I was very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="1461">I was not a very good father, I’m afraid, with my children, I got very angry sometimes, I would throw things against <span class="DLF">walls</span> , and ooh, when I think back of it, it’s almost unbelievable that I was like that, but I -- I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1462">Had no insight in myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="1463">That is all changed, you know, you begin to -- maybe just age, but also, again, finding out about what happened to us then, has clarified my own personality a lot, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1464">I can see myself now as -- as that -- the little boy, who -- how he grew up, and how he -- the 1929 episode in -- in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> was a terrible one. </span><span class="sentence" id="1465">My mother had to farm me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1466">She farmed me out to a young woman who -- I don’t know if she beat me, but she was very bad for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1467">I remember crying, and doing -- and finally my mother found out, and she took me away from there, and farmed me out to old people, grandma, grandpa they were called, and they were lovely for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1468">But that first -- first experience, being separated from my mother, who had to go to work because my father was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> then, and being alone, and being mistreated, when the war came, and the whole thing started all over again, the loneliness, and the danger and the fear, I think it all accumulated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1469">And then we had, what, 25 years of doing nothing, and then you wind up with a psychiatrist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1470">It’s -- You know, it’s funny. </span><span class="sentence" id="1471">One of the last sessions -- recently I had to go back to him for just the one session, because I have interviewed a man nearby here, who had been in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> with his brother, and the story was so terrible that I had nightmares overnight, wh-what happened to him, happened to me during the night, and the next morning I was crazy, I -- I couldn’t clear my head, and I -- my wife said, “You've got to go see -- see a shrink because, you know, this has been too much of a thing.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1472">And I went back to him, and we tal -- and he helped me immediately, and we talked about it, and he -- he explained to me why it upset me so much, because it was -- this man had been with his brother in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and it brought all my war stories back, the danger, and the fear with my little brothers, and -- and I said, “You know, I never talked about the Holocaust with you, did I?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1473">And he began to laugh, he said, “You did nothing else.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1474">He says, “You did -- you did all the time,” he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1475">I said, “I can’t remember that, did I talk about? </span><span class="sentence" id="1476">I thought I only talked about sex, and -- and -- and women, and,” -- he said, “You crazy.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1477">He said, “You,” -- no, he didn’t say I was crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1478">He said, “Ed,” he said, “every session you talked about the Holocaust.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1479">Oh, I did? </span><span class="sentence" id="1480">All right.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1481">So, I don’t know where we started with this question, I lost myself in the answer, but -- oh, did th -- did therapy change me, how did it change me? </span><span class="sentence" id="1482">It made me into a more wise person, I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="1483">More livable person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1484">I don’t think our marriage would have lasted if I hadn’t, was pretty impossible, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1485">Carla is very even person, 1s like -- the whole family, her mother was like that, her brother is like that, they’re wonderful people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1486">They - They’re not -- don’t have great emotional outbursts on the up side, but also not on the https://collections.ushmm.org down side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1487">They’re very, very stable, and I was very unstable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1488">So, Iam more stable now, let’s put it that way.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1489">QUESTION:  In -- In terms of what’s made you and Carla so involved now, recently, the last 10 years, where maybe other people, other survivors, they’ ve withdrawn more, what’s made you do -- choose that <span class="DLF">path</span> , and also how is it -- how has that changed you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1490">ANSWER:  You know, I -- I’ve thought about it, and I’ve come up with an answer that may not be the right one, but when you deal with Holocaust survivors, as you do now, and as I have done in interviews, you realize there’s an enormous range of suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="1491">Those people -- and I’ve interviewed people who were lying 1n a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the ground in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> for nine months, frozen practically to death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1492">That is not comparable to what I -- what happened to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1493">They saw th -- I’ve interviewed people where, first their fa -- their mother, then their father was killed, then the brothers, a -- a woman had seven brothers, she wound up with one after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1494">One by one they were killed in <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Polish forests</span> where they were in hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1495">One by one, she saw them being slaughtered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1496">That woman is probably -- it is probably impossible for her to go out and do interviews -- interview other Holocaust survivors. </span><span class="sentence" id="1497">I come from a family that survived complete. </span><span class="sentence" id="1498">An oddity in <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> , by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1499"><span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> has a -- has a -- I don’t know if you’re familiar with the statistics of <span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1500"><span class="COUNTRY">Holland</span> is the worst <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> after <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , and certainly by far the -- the worst <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> for survivors in -- in the -- in -- west of Europe, <span class="REGION">western Europe</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1501">So, my k -- my family survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="1502">I came out with a father, I came out with a mother, I came out with two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1503">I came out with cousins, I came with uncles, aunts, a whole family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1504">I think that because of that, it is possible for me to go and interview other people, and not go completely to pieces. </span><span class="sentence" id="1505">I think if I had been like the woman who saw her family slaughtered one by one in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Polish forest</span> , I don’t think I could be like -- sitting here, talking with you like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1506">So -- Then there is something else, this is usually not talked about. </span><span class="sentence" id="1507">There is an intellectual range in Holocaust survivors, as well as non-Holocaust survivors, course. </span><span class="sentence" id="1508">It makes a big difference what -- where you come from, intellectually. </span><span class="sentence" id="1509">If you come from a Polish farming family, a Jewish family, somewhere in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">shtetl</span> , where the father was a shoemaker, and the mother did the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , and -- and life was fairly primitive, but wonderful, but then, that’s not my background either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1510">I come from a family, my father was an artist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1511">My mother was a telegraph operator when she -- when -- when no women were practically working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1512">I come from a family that loved music, loved literature, loved all the kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1513">I come from a family where I have one -- two brothers who were college professors, one -- one has changed in the meantime, to be an -- a psych -- a psychotherapist. </span><span class="sentence" id="1514">You know, this makes a big difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1515">I-It’s possible for -- for Carla and me, come from a little different group, little different level, to help others. </span><span class="sentence" id="1516">When -- When we go to national conferences, and I see the others, they’re not that many that -- I cried when I saw them the first time, the 1600 hidden children, and I still feel, you know, love for them, but -- but I realize now that not all Holocaust survivors are people that -- that I can -- that I can feel at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with, you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="1517">And it’s interesting in https://collections.ushmm.org many of the interviews that I’ve done, the interviewee said, “Ed, we got to get together afterwards, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1518">Let’s go out, you and my -- my wife, and -- a-a-and I, and you and your wife, and we’re going to have dinner together.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1519">And I thought, “I can’t do this, not with you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1520">I mean, very primitive people sometimes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1521">Lovely people, but primitive, I couldn’t -- you know, I couldn’t. </span><span class="sentence" id="1522">There was nothing we had in common, except that I interviewed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1523">So -- Let’s see, what was the qu -- what was the question? </span><span class="sentence" id="1524">Oh, why do we -- why can we do this, and others cannot? </span><span class="sentence" id="1525">I think it had to do with our background, the fact that we’re not too damaged, and the fact that we came from backgrounds where reading, and -- and -- and culture was of -- of importance. </span><span class="sentence" id="1526">And you’|I find this all over, if you look at the people who, let’s say, are important in -- in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holocaust community</span> , they’re most -- mostly people who were not that terribly damaged, and who -- who can write, and read, and understand, and so -- or a psychologist, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="1527">I don’t kn -- I -- I think -- that is my view of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1528">QUESTION:  Is there anything else that you want to --
ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="1529">I forgot something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1530">And I think he deserves a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and I don’t think he is in the original interview, because he couldn’t be. </span><span class="sentence" id="1531">After the conference, in 1981, of the Hidden Children, a letter arrived at my -- my wife’s <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">desk</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , of the Hidden Children, from a man in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yonkers</span> , his name was Eddie Strauss, have you heard of him? </span><span class="sentence" id="1532">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1533">Eddie Strauss wrote a letter, and it said, “I’m so sorry, I’m a hidden child from <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and I’m so terribly sorry I couldn’t come to the conference, because I was in the https://collections.ushmm.org <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , but I would like to take up contact with you.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1534">And Carla came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with this letter, and she handed it to me, and said, “Listen, I’m very busy, and this man writes, and he lives right nearby here, about 10 minutes away, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yonkers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1535">Maybe you can contact him.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1536">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1537">So one day I call -- called up this man, and I got him on the phone, and I -- and I said, “Ah, Mr. Strauss?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1538">Yes?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1539">I said, “My wife handed me this letter, could I come and say hello to you?” </span><span class="sentence" id="1540">You know. “</span><span class="sentence" id="1541">Yeah, I heard you -- you were sorry you couldn’t come to the conference.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="1542">Yes,” he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="1543">So I went down, straight down <span class="DLF">Broadway</span> , same <span class="DLF">Broadway</span> you have in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , and entered a dark <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , climbed five <span class="DLF">stairs</span> , five steps up from street level, and entered a dark <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and there in the far -- far end of the dark <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> sat a man in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchair</span> , with one leg. </span><span class="sentence" id="1544">I hadn’t expected this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1545">He was overweight, and I shook his hand, and I said, “So, tell me about yourself.” </span><span class="sentence" id="1546">And out comes this story that he was -- he lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Antwerp</span> , in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , and he was play -- out playing one day, and he stayed out too late, and when he came back, a neighbor grabbed him from the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and said, “You can’t go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .” </span><span class="sentence" id="1547">And he found out later that his mother, his grandmother, his three year old sister, and his one year old baby brother had been snatched away from the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that day by -- by the Germans, put in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1548">They were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and the day that they arrived, they were all gassed, all murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="1549">That was Eddie’s background, and his family. </span><span class="sentence" id="1550">He wound up in an <span class="BUILDING">orphan home</span> in -- <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> had six or seven <span class="BUILDING">orphan homes</span> that were set up by the -- by the Judenrat, and with help of the Belgian Queen Mother, and the Germans knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1551">So these children were really, I say, hostages of the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1552">But they were cared for, and taken care of, and Eddie had been one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1553">He had, after the war, he had come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1554">He -- He went to an uncle of his in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Manhattan</span> , and -- and his grandfather lived there, and it didn’t work out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1555">They were German Jews, and they couldn’t understand this boy who had, at one time, been found in the <span class="DLF">street</span> , totally full of lice, and -- and full of wounds, and -- so Eddie was placed somewhere in <span class="REGION">New Jersey</span> , with people who were very good for him, and he went to -- he went to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , and he graduated, very smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="1556">Joined the American army -- was drafted into the American army, and of all <span class="NPIP">places</span> was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , because he knew fluent German, and he knew French fluently, and English. </span><span class="sentence" id="1557">And he worked for the adjutant general, or something like that, in -- in -- in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munchen</span> , or so-someplace, interviewing Germans to see if they were Nazis, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1558">He came back, and he invented a story about himself, he made an artificial life. </span><span class="sentence" id="1559">The people didn’t know that he was Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1560">He st -- He said that when people asked about his parents, he said they had died in a car accident in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , and he had had -- he had a sister somewhere, but also in <span class="REGION">Texas</span> , and he hadn’t seen her in years, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1561">He told me all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1562">His name was Eddie, like mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="1563">Our birthdates happened to be the same, the eighth of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="1564">And somehow another, I decided that I would adopt this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1565">And I began to do what in Jewish we call mitzvahs, good deeds. </span><span class="sentence" id="1566">I got him -- first of all, I got him money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1567">I helped him with everything he needed, as much as I could, and he became like a brother to me, and I was his brother, you know, I’m the brother that had died. </span><span class="sentence" id="1568">And I took care of him as much as I could, for years. </span><span class="sentence" id="1569">He went -- He had only one leg, he had diabetes, and about a year after I met him, his other leg had to be amputated, so now he had no legs at all, and he wanted to commit suicide, he had tried once to commit suicide. </span><span class="sentence" id="1570">Ha -- But he got a new <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , a nice, clean <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and he had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">electric wheelchair</span> , which made him very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1571">And I gi -- brought him gifts, and I brought him books, and I talked with him, and -- and I took him to Hidden Child meetings in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> , on Purim, or you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1572">And he was here, we sat in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with him for Passover, to the seder, we invited him, and brought him with. </span><span class="sentence" id="1573">Lot of trouble, always, getting him with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchair</span> to there -- <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1574">And we took him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , I took him to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> when the Hidden Children, our group from <span class="REGION">Westchester</span> , went to the <span class="BUILDING">Holocaust museum</span> , he wanted to go there, and you can’t imagine what we went through, took Eddie in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wheelchair</span> to -- to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1575">And February, 1997, he died in front of the computer I had gotten him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1576">He wanted to learn the computer, and he learned, and then he was suddenly dead, and he was gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="1577">And it fell to me to take care of his stuff, little stuff that he had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1578">And it fell to me, about a year ago, to put a -- to take care of his funeral, and then later to put a stone on -- on his <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1579">And I decided that there was more to him than just -- more to his <span class="DLF">grave</span> , and there should be more to that <span class="DLF">grave</span> , and I had a gra -- on the gravestone, I had a stonemason chisel that -- something like, in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> -- let this <span class="NPIP">place</span> remember not only Eddie Strauss, whose name was really Abraham Katz, but also his mother, with her name, and his father, and https://collections.ushmm.org his sister Esther, and his little one year old brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1580">I put all their names on there, with the dates, all killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1581">So that gravestone is nearby here, and I’m very proud of that, that at least that’s the last thing I could do for Eddie. </span><span class="sentence" id="1582">And I wanted to put that in, it was also a part of my development after the war, as a -- an aware Jew, let me put it that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1583">End of Tape Four, Side
