<p><span class="sentence" id="3">QUESTION:  From way back. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">This is a long reach.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Well, my name is Ernst Weiths, and I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> in 1908. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">I am coming from a completely full Jewish background because my father was Jewish, my mother was Jewish, both grandparents were Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">So, I was born in 1908. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And, uh, I had a sister; she was born in 1914. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">My father was...actually my grandfather had a <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> ; and my father was working with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">And he didn't like it. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">And, uh, he had, uh, two brothers, one was engineer; and the younger was...uh a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And he hated the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and he hated office work; but he became then an accountant later on, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">And, uh, we were together-- the whole family was together 'til the war broke out in 1914. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">And then my father had to go to war. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And when he came back in 1918, he met somebody else. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">They met in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Salzburg</span> --that 1s close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And when he came finally <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he was asking for a divorce. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">So, we had these four years of war, we had hardly anything to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">My mother had to go out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , exchange her rings and everything for food, what it was like at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Everything was rationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">You had to get card or marks, cards for your food. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">You got frozen potatoes and all that stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Anyway, then finally when he got his...uh his divorce, we still--my sister and myself were still with my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">Up until 19... until the time when I was ll. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And he didn't give her any child support or anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">She had to raise the two of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And it came the time when she just couldn't do it anymore, and told me that I have to go and live with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">So...and she kept my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So my father was in another state of <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> with his new wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">They worked, uh both as accountants, for a company. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And one day I packed a little suitcase and went on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and went to see them, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">And it was real...not very comfortable for them, because nobody knew that he had a 11 year-old son. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">So he actually didn't, uh, look forward to that very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">But he had no other choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And, uh, so that I stayed with them and I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I mean, I finished <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , and my mother let me go to--by the way, here you call it <span class="BUILDING">college</span> , [but] it was <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> --in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> for one year. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">But I didn't do so good in Latin and Greek. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">So when I came to my father, first of all he didn't want to spend the money to go to a <span class="BUILDING">college</span> or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">So he said, "I just...you just try to finish <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> here, you know, and then we see." </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So in the meantime uh they uh asked me to be baptized, because my stepmother was Lutheran. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And when they married, my father became Lutheran too. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">So I got baptized over there when I was 11 or 12, and I had my documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Actually, I didn't have anything to do with being Jewish from that age on, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">From 11 on. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I went to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> ; and we had religion <span class="NPIP">outside</span> with the Pastor and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So I stayed with them...uh 11, 12, 13, 14...when I was 14-- 'til I was 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So, my father... I, myself, at that uh age, I didn't really know...know what I wanted to be later on, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I thought maybe I'd follow him and go in a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and learn accounting, or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">No he didn't...he didn't want that at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">He was...he hated his job. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">He was more for nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">He loved flowers and animals--I mean, not animals, but fish. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">He loved fish and flowers. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Cactus, actually. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And he was...when we lived together with him, we had the whole--even before, when he was still married to my real mother, he had the whole <span class="INT_SPACE">living room</span> full with aquariums, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">With fish and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">And every time he bought a new fish, he hid it behind him and sneaked it in; because my mother didn't want him to spend the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They were very expensive, and we didn't hardly have enough money to live on. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">So when he was with his other wife, he did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">He had these aquariums all over the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> ; and he had the <span class="DLF">windows</span> covered with flower pots and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">And he wanted me not to go in a <span class="BUILDING">office</span> ...work in an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Go out and be in the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , in nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">So one day they went on vacation to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and they went to all this...the biggest <span class="BUILDING">nurseries</span> that there are in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">And finally he found me a <span class="NPIP">place</span> to learn, to begun, in a <span class="BUILDING">nursery</span> , in...1n <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kempten</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">Close to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="67">You know, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">So but I thought maybe it's alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I was real skinny, not strong as anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">And they came back, picked me up and took me there to that <span class="BUILDING">nursery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Was only the boss, his wife, and they had a daughter which was a little younger than I was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  How old were you at that time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">ANSWER:  I was 14. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">When you have to learn this job, you have to learn 3 years; and in these 3 years, they gave me a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and board, you know, and no money. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">You didn't...you don't get paid for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">You're learning. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">So...but I had to get up at 6:00 in the morning; I was already out there, working. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And I was...I wasn't strong or anything, but I made it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">Carried this big stuff around and worked in the <span class="BUILDING">greenhouse</span> , worked <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And my boss was...he was an excellent nursery man, a gardener. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">He was the best in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">But at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , he was the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">He beat his wife up every other day. (</span><span class="sentence" id="84">Laughing) So this girl and myself, we grew up in that milieu, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="85">And she was, I think, only 2 years younger than I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">And I had to work 6:00 in the morning, and even some...most of the time until 9:00 in the evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And uh when it was dark <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , come in the <span class="BUILDING">shed</span> and I had to cut the wood, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">And then when he came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> from drinking, he said, "You can go now." </span><span class="sentence" id="90">To sleep, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And then he was full of hard going, he came back at 11:00 back from the...from the...back from the <span class="DLF">gardens</span> , from the <span class="BUILDING">greenhouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And he then he went up and hear beating up again and again. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Oh, well, it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">But I... And then, of course, when I came there, the first few months I was crying every night. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I was homesick. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">And my parents in the meantime got transferred back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> from that <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they used to work out in another <span class="NPIP">state</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">So they stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And uh well, after 3 years he wanted me to stay on and he would pay me. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And I said, "No, I don't want to stay any longer." </span><span class="sentence" id="100">In that job, you go from <span class="BUILDING">nursery</span> to <span class="BUILDING">nursery</span> to learn more and more and more. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">So he got me a job in another one about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="102"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> is about three hours by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="103">And I stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">That uh was nice, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">The people that worked in the <span class="BUILDING">nurseries</span> , most of them, they stayed in; they got their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bed</span> and their food and everything there. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So I stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">Another couple of years, I moved on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Stuttgart</span> --which is <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , too. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">And I stayed there another couple of years. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">And then--I think 1t was 1928--I came back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="110">And, uh, my father and my stepmother had a nice <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> off in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburbs</span> , and I had a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But my work was on the other side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">It was one of the biggest <span class="BUILDING">nurseries</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">So I worked there, but I had to go back and forth. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And after awhile, it was too much; so I got my own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> close by about 5 minutes from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">nursery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">And I had my own <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">And I made my money there. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And some days, holidays when I was off, I went <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They did my laundry at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and everything; and over the weekend I stayed <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And then I went back to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">So, that went on from 1928 to 1938. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">I was there 10 years.</span></p>

(</span><span class="sentence" id="151">Laughing) But he didn't, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">I mean, the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , they uh were, of course, on his side. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">And they hated the Jews for centuries, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">They were glad they had a chance to get rid of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So these people came up, and said he had to let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I can't stay in his <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And in the <span class="BUILDING">nursery</span> , the guy...they couldn't believe it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I just, I said, "Well, I am sorry, but I have to quit. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I have to quit."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  How had they found out? </span><span class="sentence" id="161">They had gone and searched your records?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  You said in '38 everything changed when Hitler came to power. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Could you tell us some of the things that changed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  Well, first of all, everybody had to wear the star, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Whoever was Jewish had to wear the star.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">QUESTION:  You, too?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">ANSWER:  Yah, sure! </span><span class="sentence" id="177">And uh...I mean, most of the time we just covered it up when we could get away with it, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">But if they catched you, that was...that would of be terrible, but... Then finally, you know, they closed <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> , they started deporting Jewish... And uh I...I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and for a little...
