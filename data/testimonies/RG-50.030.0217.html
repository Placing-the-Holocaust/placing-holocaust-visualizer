<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION: You can speak now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1">We are recording.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER: Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My name is Stanislaw Soszynski. </span><span class="sentence" id="4">I was born on February 24, 1931, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Old Town</span> through my whole childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">This is the oldest part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , mostly inhabited by the poor, craftsmen, merchants. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">A very diverse population, forming the northern part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="8">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> was inhabited by many, even very many, Jewish families. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">In our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , at <span class="DLF">11 Fret Street</span> , there lived five Jewish families, out of twenty-odd total in the <span class="BUILDING">building</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Our relations were those of neighbors, that is <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> were not locked, theft was unknown. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Nowadays the full symbiosis that existed in those crowded, packed <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> is forgotten. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">There were of course disturbances in this symbiosis. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">There had to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">Whenever people are crowded into a <span class="INT_SPACE">mall space</span> , the conflicts of their interests lead to occasional strife. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">That peaceful life, that life of storekeepers, tradesmen, craftsmen, minor civil servants, was interrupted by the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">There was an immense <span class="BUILDING">market hall</span> near the <span class="DLF">street</span> that I lived on. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">It was on <span class="DLF">Swietojerska Street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">It was split in half, and fish were sold on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> , while vegetables, fruits, and dairy products were sold on the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">That <span class="BUILDING">market hall</span> will be very important to the lives of many people during the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Firstly, food will be sent through it, for it stood on the <span class="DLF">line</span> that was designated by the Germans as the <span class="DLF">border</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">Later, in the years of the defense of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Old Town</span> , that <span class="BUILDING">hall</span> will be transformed into a huge <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Although it is impossible to change a <span class="BUILDING">fish market</span> or a <span class="BUILDING">produce market</span> into a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , that was how it was, regardless. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">The siege of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in 1939 was a great drama. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">The Germans, having broken the resistance of the Polish army west of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> , surrounded <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="25">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was full of historic architectural artifacts and monuments. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">Almost 700 antique <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were so ravaged by the war that they had to be built practically all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Besides, the 1.5 million enclosed people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> defended itself desperately, led by President Stefan Starzynski. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">The defenders consisted partly of members of the Jewish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">President Starzynski, the defender of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in 1939, appointed Czerniakow as his co-worker representing the Jewish population, the Jewish society. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">When the Germans entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , a demolished <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> covered in snow, in which the <span class="DLF">walls</span> smelled scorched. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I lived through one of the most difficult times in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">We were going on <span class="DLF">Wierzbowa Street</span> to Marshall Jozef Pilsudski Square to visit my aunt, passing the burned <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> of <span class="DLF">Theater Square</span> , when on the other side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> I saw a man who appeared to be drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">I was with my father and my siblings. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">He was stumbling from the sides of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> to the <span class="DLF">curb</span> and weaving across the width of the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="35">At last he fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">Father said that we should keep going down the side of the <span class="DLF">street</span> that we were on, but he crossed the <span class="DLF">street</span> and approached the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">He picked him up, and now others came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Together they sat him on a <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">I saw that my father lifted up the man's trouser leg and bound the man's leg with his handkerchief. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">He kept going down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , parallel to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">When we came out onto the square, I noticed that Z-shaped anti-aircraft ditches had been dug into the grass of the square. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">There were some people filling them in while a German sentry watched over them. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">The soldier wore a helmet and carried a carbine with an affixed bayonet. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Father went up to him and looked at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">He came back and said "That thug ran his bayonet through that man's leg." </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I could not understand how someone could simply bayonet someone's leg like that, on the <span class="DLF">street</span> in broad daylight, simply because he was not filling a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> fast enough, or, as it later turned out, because he was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">It was an inexplicable situation, but I realized then that a time had come when law went against common sense... these are complex matters, I cannot explain, but I realized that invaders, Germans, bad people had come.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION: You were eight years old then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER: I was then eight years old, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">A common life of poverty commenced. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was destroyed, there was no running water, no light, no food. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Water was carried from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Because women did the laundry in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , every <span class="BUILDING">home</span> had a big kettle for doing the wash. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">The men stood in a row and together took all of the pots. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">They went in long strings to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> , taking <span class="DLF">streets</span> that sloped down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="56">They nailed together boards and put them over the water they collected so that it would not splash out. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">These problems cemented people all the more; nothing unites like misfortune. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">Joy may split, while misery draws people together. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">This is the second scene that I remember, and it also is as if from a ghastly dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">German patrols began appearing in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> dressed in what were known before the war as anti- [102] suits. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">They were made out of a watertight, prepared fabric. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">On their backs they carried <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and in their hands they had nozzles such as are today used to apply lacquer under pressure. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">There was some kind of poison in those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> , phenol or carbolic acid or some other liquid that destroyed everything that it came into contact with. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">It turned out that these patrols demanded money from owners of <span class="BUILDING">Jewish stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="65">If the extortion money was not paid, the Germans would hose down the inside of the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> with the carbolic acid. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">There was a jeweler in the next <span class="BUILDING">building</span> to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">He had a tiny <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , so small that the <span class="DLF">door</span> simultaneously served as the display. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">counter</span> inside, while the precious things he put on display were hung on an ingenious little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">shelf</span> in the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I stood before the <span class="DLF">door</span> when the Germans came up and demanded payment - he did not have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Within a few minutes, the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> had been soaked with that stinking carbolic acid. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">To this day, I get a feeling of grimness whenever I enter a newly disinfected <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , because I see a man with that destructive nozzle in his hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">There was no talk of a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> at the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">At first it was even said that the Jews would be in a better situation than the Poles under the occupation because they would be able to understand what the Germans were saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">The lion's share of the Jewish people understood German. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">This turned out to be an illusion. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">The winter of 1939-1940 was bitterly cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">The frost was so strong that it split open <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">On <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Town Square</span> , there stood a dozen <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> at the base of which was a temporary <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">In the middle stood a statue of the patron of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> broke up so that limbs were falling down on the <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">During that winter I wore my scarf, earmuffs, a fur hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">I was standing in the <span class="DLF">gate</span> when one of my friends ran out bare-headed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION: One of your Jewish friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER: Yes, one of my Jewish friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">I motioned to him with my chin, to ask "Hey, have you gone crazy? </span><span class="sentence" id="85">You should put something on your head." </span><span class="sentence" id="86">He motioned with his head at a German patrol standing at a narrowing in the <span class="DLF">street</span> to which all the passing Jews had to bow. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">He did not have a cap so that he would not have to bow, in that horrible cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">I looked at him, he was three or four years older than me, and I felt the strangeness of the situation. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Then talk began that there would be a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , that all the nationalities in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> would be put into their own <span class="REGION">zones</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="90">No one said that there would be a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> , an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">extermination section</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I think that the precision with which that society was destroyed was the result of great thought - psychological thought, organizational thought. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">I think that it must have been done by people who knew mob psychology. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">It is not so simple to collect three or four hundred thousand people in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> without telling them about one's goal, one's purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">The first step was simply lying: that is, it was said that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> would be split into sections. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">There would be an assigned Aryan section, a German section, a Jewish section. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> was relatively speaking huge, very large in this first phase. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">These <span class="REGION">sections</span> were to be inhabited exclusively by those assigned to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">The psychological groundwork for this division was laid by posting on streetcar posts and street lanterns signs that said "Jews Are Forbidden To Walk On This Side Of The <span class="DLF">Street</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Suddenly, a part of the <span class="DLF">street</span> was off-limits, like <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> , like <span class="DLF">parks</span> , and similar places in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Another form of preparation was that the Germans placed signs on the <span class="DLF">roads</span> that instructed drivers to drive past very quickly because the <span class="REGION">area</span> was infected with typhus. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Finally, small <span class="DLF">walls</span> sprang up. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">The people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , especially the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Old Town</span> , the oldest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> , were hot-headed, and if <span class="DLF">walls</span> were put up against their will, then they took them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">At first those <span class="DLF">walls</span> were taken part. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Someone needed some bricks, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">It turned out that this was another ploy: it was said that the <span class="DLF">walls</span> would form <span class="DLF">checkpoints</span> where the police could check passer-by's identification, but in reality 1t was announced that the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhood</span> was closed, and that people who were forced to wear armbands with the Star of David had to go there. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Tens of thousands of people living in that <span class="REGION">zone</span> had to be moved, however.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION: Your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was not in the <span class="REGION">zone</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER: Our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was on the <span class="DLF">border</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION: So it was still on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER: The back of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="111">But our part, the front of the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , where our <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was, was on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">This later led to an unexpected result: the great smuggling operation that began when the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">For example, people would pour milk down the <span class="DLF">drain-pipes</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> part. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But now I am speaking about the point when tens of thousands of people were leaving the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and tens of thousands were moving in. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">Because time was very short, the people who had property there had to quickly sell everything in an effort to save something. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Those people were pauperized. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">So a great <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was created, containing 300,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Today, when one looks at a map and knows the outcome of it all, one can see that the <span class="DLF">line</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was very carefully drawn so as to leave all large <span class="DLF">parks</span> outside. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">No large area of greenery, no square that could give some respite to the children there, not to mention the adults. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">One of the surprising, shocking facts that I have learned is the story of the teacher in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> who asked the children to draw summer. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">It turned out that the children did not know what it looks like. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">Four and five year-old children who had grown up behind the <span class="DLF">walls</span> could not; draw a horse, cows, sheep they did not even know what those things were. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Families left our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in tears. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Superintendent Bomoski [ph -220], a simple man, helped them load what they had - they were not rich people. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">In any case, we said that sooner or later the war would end, that we would surely see each other again. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Unfortunately this was not to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Those <span class="DLF">walls</span> were the battle-ground of a contest between the leadership of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the people of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Because by means of those <span class="DLF">walls</span> , attention was turned away from the basic facts. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">If one day it was announced that Zlota, Hoza, or Sienna, or a part of a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> was no longer in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or else was now included in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , it seemed as if directing energies toward "defense" was the most important thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">In reality, this was not the case. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Hunger began there. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">Rations were purposely reduced so that hunger began. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Small boys who could get through the <span class="DLF">holes</span> knocked in the <span class="DLF">walls</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Among others, two boys from our <span class="BUILDING">building</span> came. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">They sat on a stump. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">All of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> in that old part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , since the only heat was from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">coal stoves</span> , had large stumps in the <span class="DLF">courtyard</span> for chopping wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">They sat on that stump, we all ran up. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">They sad that it was hard, that some of their parents were in poor health, that they came because they had nowhere to go and they knew they had friends here, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">The adults gave them, I had nothing of course, what they had, some pieces of bacon, bags of flour. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">I made an appointment to see them. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">Because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> went through the <span class="DLF">streets</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Powzazki</span> , there was no other way for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> to go, one could board on the <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> and ride through. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Although a policeman guarded the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , it was possible to jump out, at first, when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">streetcar</span> still operated as it did before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">I suddenly found myself in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that is hard to imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Thousands of people walked back and forth, apparently with no purpose. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Peddlers ran around with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carts</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Someone was selling bread, which he kept in a basket made of barbed wire, so that no one could take it without paying. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">All of this was so unbelievable that even now that I am an adult, an old man, an artist, whenever I try to represent it graphically I look at my work and think that it is complete]y surrealistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Bread bundled in barbed wire is inedible. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">One cannot even begin to share those peoples experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I found the boys: it turned out that they lived with ten other people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Sanitary problems began immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">Today, in a world in which everything works without disruption, we do not understand what it means, twelve people in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">Not in one <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Now, suddenly that one small <span class="INT_SPACE">water closet</span> intended for the use of a family of four or five must function as a street lavatory. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">An unbelievable thing started to happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I cannot talk about people dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">I know it now, but I did not see it then. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">But there were dead bodies laying on the <span class="DLF">sidewalks</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">QUESTION: In the <span class="DLF">street</span> or on the side?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">ANSWER: Everywhere! </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Today it is known that; on <span class="DLF">Krochmalna Street</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> in which, out of four hundred inhabitants, four hundred died! </span><span class="sentence" id="162">A whole <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> died, a huge <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> with four hundred people. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">After some time, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was sealed off completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">One could not go in without a special pass, and even with a pass... the story went around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> that a Polish doctor, on the so-called <span class="REGION">Aryan side</span> , whom a Jewish doctor called because he had a serious case, went into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with a pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">The Gestapo followed him and killed everyone, the patient and both of the doctors. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">That information went around the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">ANSWER: Was it true?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">ANSWER: Yes! </span><span class="sentence" id="169">Of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Today, after the war, the names of those people have been established, and it is known that it was done with all of the perfidy of the consequences that such a form of extermination carries with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Because the <span class="DLF">walls</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> moved as those people were crowded even more, and we lived close by, I had an experience that I already told you about that is I sold milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">This was necessary because my father fell ill and could no longer support the <span class="BUILDING">household</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="173">There were three of us then, my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I was twelve years old then. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I took a milk can and went outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to a farmer who would sell me twelve liters. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I was scared while transporting it, because the so-called "sentries" stood guard at all of the <span class="BUILDING">train stations</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="177">This was often quite dramatic: a German gendarme called "Pretty Boy, " because he had a very pretty appearance, an ideally smooth face, clean-shaven, a pretty boy, came into the <span class="INT_SPACE">compartment</span> and started looking for contraband. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">Meat, butter, whatever made him happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">I was sitting on my milk can between the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">seats</span> next to the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">There was another milk can up on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">luggage rack</span> , which its owner, another man, had opened so that it would not go sour. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">The German seized the can by the handle, not knowing that it was open. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">The milk poured all over him. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">Everyone began to laugh, he asked politely whose can it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">The man next to me said that it was his. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">He opened his holster and shot him, right in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Within a few seconds, the man was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">I brought the milk <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">That day I also brought; a bottle of honey <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">I was supposed to go visit a friend who lived next to the <span class="DLF">ghetto wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="190">I poured some honey on a piece of very bad bread, which reportedly was made of sawdust mixed with flour, bread which was rationed to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">I took my bread and honey and went down the <span class="DLF">street</span> eating it. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">I got too the <span class="DLF">street</span> where the <span class="DLF">ghetto wall</span> was, when a "szaulis, " a soldier working for the Germans, standing by the <span class="DLF">wall</span> in an ash-grey uniform with black cuffs and a long cartridge belt motioned to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">I was convinced that I had died because I immediately thought that I was just as scruffy and disheveled as those boys who sneaked out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in search of food, and that he had taken me for one of those boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">That was the longest walk of my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">I went up to him and waited for him to turn his gun on me and shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">It turned out that he needed my piece of bread with honey. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">He twisted my arm, took it and put it in his mouth. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Then he waved me off, "Weg." </span><span class="sentence" id="199">Coming back, I knew that I was alive, but at the same time I realized... maybe for a few minutes I was a Jewish boy - that there was no law there, that this was a horrible lawlessness. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">At one point a rumor went around <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> that Jews were being deported. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">No one knew how, but the word "<span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> " entered the vocabularies of the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="202">Of course the terror inflicted on the people of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was so strong, people were shot on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , stopped, rounded up and sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> , whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> were surrounded where thousands of men would be asked for identification and put in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> known as "boxes, " that all of these terrible rumors fell on different ears then we have today, as I speak. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">When one sees dead people on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , one reacts differently than to a man killed in a car accident. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">But all the same these were horrible matters, exceeding the imagination. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">I had another experience that was unique. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">It turned out that there was no hope for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">He is very sick, so sick that he must die. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">We were all aware of this, but a person wants to... a person clings to his hopes. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">Father was put in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> which had been a <span class="BUILDING">specialist hospital</span> before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">The <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> was located in a T-shaped area that was cut out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , but inside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="211">To go in, one had to pass a guard, go along a few <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> which belonged to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and there was the <span class="BUILDING">hospital building</span> that was separate. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">This was a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> by name only - there was no proper food there, no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">There were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">beds</span> , but again in name only -- normal, <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">iron beds</span> , not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hospital beds</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">As a result I carried part of the food we were able to obtain to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">I carried a can with a spoon and by the <span class="BUILDING">Arsenal</span> , because the <span class="DLF">wall</span> went along <span class="DLF">Przejazd Street</span> , it was completely empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Evidently there had just been a round-up or some shooting or... anyway, I saw the Wacht mann in the <span class="DLF">ghetto gate</span> from a long way away. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">He mixed up the soup to make sure there were no weapons or ammunition in it and let me pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">As I walked by those <span class="DLF">walls</span> , people appeared who were fixated by the sight of my can. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I saw this, I felt it. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They could not cross the <span class="DLF">wall</span> , but at the same time it was a horrible feeling of an indescribable hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">That was how I took it. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">A few months later, the Ghetto Uprising began. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">From what I remember, it was not the fight that it is described as today, a band of desperate people shooting and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Because we lived nearby, I saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">It was a militarily well-organized defense of parts of <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I do not know how the battle looked in the rest of the <span class="REGION">area</span> , but along Swietojerska, Bonifraterska, and <span class="DLF">Franciszkanska Streets</span> , within our sight, was fought in an exemplary way. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">So well that snipers, placed in high points in those <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> , for a few days did not even allow the German soldiers and divisions to enter that way. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">It was not until heavy artillery, with multiple barrels, was brought in, and <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were subjected to direct fire - they would fire at a <span class="NPIP">spot</span> several times, the <span class="DLF">wall</span> would collapse revealing an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and they would move on to the next <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , they were methodically destroying <span class="BUILDING">house</span> after <span class="BUILDING">house</span> - that the defenders retreated. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Another shocking method, one that the Germans would use massively during the Warsaw Uprising of 1944, were fires. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">The Germans would set fire to whole blocks of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So that northern part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> had an enormous column of smoke over it. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Because they would not let the fire department in and there was no access to that section of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> burned until they burned out. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">They then began to demolish those <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION: After the Uprising?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER: After the Ghetto Uprising. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">No one was allowed in. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">The Germans put up signs saying that they would shoot without warning at anyone found in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="238">It turned out that this was all part of their plans; in 1939, the architect Pabst had drawn up a plan for the destruction of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="239">That northern part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was to be leveled with the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="240">No one knew that then except for people like Professor Zachwatowicz, who was able to get to the documents dealing with Pabst in the <span class="BUILDING">town hall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Now, filled with horror and surprise, we watched as a great <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> of a million and a half people and covering several square kilometers was turned to desert, completely leveled. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Everything of any value was taken out: pipes, balconies, roofing, upholstery, and so on, and then the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were blown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">The <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were mined and blown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">In 1944, when the Warsaw Uprising broke out, the northern part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> that the Germans had designated to be the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was a flat plain. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">The partisans who went to attack the German divisions 1n the cemeteries discovered that there was no possibility of cover, because on an open <span class="DLF">field</span> like that, heavy machine guns can stop anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">This is very hard to describe in just a few words, those years, 39 to 45. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">If one goes to that part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> today, one can still see how it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Every time a cable is laid, everytime a shovel touches the earth there, reminders of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , that life, come up. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">I wanted to understand why it happened, why those people were destroyed, why that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">I looked for some sort of memory of those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">I dug up the strangest things there. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Some of them I could not pick up, or, feeling their gravity, I decided that I had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> worthy to hold them. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">For example, once a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozer</span> pushed aside a huge block of bricks, under which lay several hundred trouser and vest buckles, which evidently had been in a bag or a box that had decayed. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">Oxidized buckles. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">Because they had been there, crushed, for a long time, they had formed a cluster, a sculpture. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I looked at it and thought that this was a kind of summation of what had happened there. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">There must have been a sickly tailor there who was suddenly told that he had to leave everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Of course, the buckles were the most important thing to him, because that was his <span class="BUILDING">shop</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">He hid them down there in the <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="260">They took his live away, and the buckles lay there. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">An object, a tiny object, can say more about a drama like this than a hundred words. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">That flat plain was petrifying to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="263">It made it clear that life is stronger than that... that... demonic destruction. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">That was not human destruction, it was somehow devilish. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The knowledge that someday this would all be grown over, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> would sprout, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">neighborhoods</span> , children who did not even know what had happened would be playing, it would be another <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">I tried to remember and cement in my memory what had happened from this angle and I collected fragments of that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and of that life. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Sometimes the images I saw wandering in the ruins were surrealistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">I think that I have told about this already. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I once saw that bricks were flying into the <span class="DLF">air</span> on that flat plain. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">They would jump up. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">A brick would leap into the <span class="DLF">air</span> and fall down again. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">There were whole <span class="DLF">fields</span> of jumping bricks. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I could not understand, I thought that I was starting to see things, for how do bricks jump? </span><span class="sentence" id="274">But I put aside my concern and went closer to where the bricks were flying. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I now saw with great surprise that that Teutonic fury had destroyed everything on the surface, but that down below the fundament remained, and they contained good, healthy brick. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So the local carters earned money by clinging <span class="DLF">holes</span> down to the fundament, throwing the bricks up to the surface, and selling them to people who were building. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">It was very simple and logical, there was nothing extraordinary about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">All the same, that was how life began to creep back into that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">Spontaneously, in the general rebuilding of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , it began by taking out the bricks, restoring order. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">The bricks were put in piles, the <span class="REGION">area</span> was cleaned, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Muranow residential district</span> was built, partly on land that had been part of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> began to expand as far as the cemeteries that are still there today. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">It turned out that this was a kind of holy place. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Today it is very difficult to build something in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> without disturbing the peace of the murdered. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">A bulldozer scooping up earth to build a fundament brings up human bones, <span class="DLF">mass graves</span> are found in completely unexpected <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="285">Every time a new <span class="DLF">urban building site</span> is being chosen, history must be examined to ensure that the <span class="NPIP">place</span> is not one of martyrdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="286">QUESTION: And later the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> was destroyed thus, all of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="287">ANSWER: The Uprising?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION: You did not tell us your experiences during the Uprising.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">ANSWER: That is because I did not know that: 1t was a subject of our conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">A year after the events in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> rose to do battle. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">As it turned out, that what they had done in one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">district</span> , they now expanded onto a scale of the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="292">My beloved <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Old Town</span> , in which I grew up, and which was the place on earth to which I belonged, as everyone should have such a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , was leveled just as the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">It is very hard to understand the words "Your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> has burned down." </span><span class="sentence" id="294">They are only five words, but it is very difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">When we went out, it was also very surrealistic. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I kept fish. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">I always liked animals, birds, plants. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">I made myself an <span class="DLF">aquarium</span> and kept fish. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">I had already had one sad experience: <span class="DLF">windows</span> had to be completely blacked-out, so that no light at all got out, and it was winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Upon opening the curtain one morning, I saw that the <span class="INT_SPACE">aquarium</span> had frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">It was so cold in the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> that those poor fish were frozen still in the ice. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">It is now September 2, 1944, the end of the defense of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Old Town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">We are to come out with our hands up. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I run into the <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and there is the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aquarium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I know that soon there will be a great fire here, and that the aquarium will shatter, and that that little bit of water has no chance of putting the fire out. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">The <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> is a place to which one comes back, to which one comes with the feeling that it is a place of respite - I will not mention the English saying, my <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> , the place in which I rule -- and now it does not exist. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">The <span class="DLF">walls</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> have been jarred apart, and from the gap between them I can see the ruins of the neighboring <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">These are all surrealistic images. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">During those 32 days of fighting, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Old Town</span> was demolished down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">When we came back in January 1945, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">It was kilometers of, tens of, hundreds of <span class="DLF">streets</span> where no one lived and burned out <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> stood. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Not only that, but it turned out that the whole infrastructure, telephone links, gas, light, water, it all had been destroyed underground with special instruments. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I now know, as an architect and as a person who is interested in his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , that German scientists prepared a device called a "Typhoon" which blew up <span class="DLF">sewers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="314">It was made and used. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Unfortunately for them, it was well thought-out scientifically - assuming that all of the <span class="DLF">sewer entrances</span> were closed. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">In that case, the <span class="DLF">sewer</span> would be destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Because both in the Ghetto Uprising and in the Warsaw Uprising soldiers used the <span class="DLF">sewers</span> to travel under the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , some of the <span class="DLF">entrances</span> were open. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Even on the territory of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , a board with some debris would be placed over the <span class="DLF">entrance</span> , and this made blowing the <span class="DLF">sewer</span> up impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Which saved <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> in 1945, because it was said that the hundreds of kilometers of <span class="DLF">sewers</span> could not be built in another <span class="NPIP">place</span> , but here there at least is the existing network. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">The destruction of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was planned . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">I mentioned <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pabst</span> 's plan. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">But in 1944, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> was turned into a <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Festung-Warschau</span> , on Hitler's orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">This <span class="BUILDING">fortress</span> was supposed to hold the Red Army at the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Vistula</span> , and to prepare the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> for the fighting, special detachments went around dynamiting <span class="DLF">city blocks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="324">As if this were not enough, places of cultural value were consciously targeted for exploding, and an average soldier could not do this on his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leszno</span> , near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Poznan</span> , in 1945, the files of the certified architect Menzenbach [ph - 42 ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">He was a methodical man . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">Every card in the file was labeled as belonging to him, and each had a photograph of a <span class="NPIP">place</span> he had registered, with a note next to it saying when, where, and what was to blown up. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Looking through the cards, one is horrified. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">A qualified architect, a man whose purpose is to raise <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">earth</span> to serve man, to make something beautiful, using all of his knowledge against the works of his colleagues; he walked and classified: this is to be blown up, because it has value. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">This is not to be blown up, because it is not valuable from a cultural standpoint. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">An example of this is the Bril [ph - '53] <span class="BUILDING">Palace</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">The <span class="BUILDING">palace</span> is not distinguished by its architecture compared to a Secessionist [ 55 | standing next to it that had no cultural importance. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">But the Bril [?] </span><span class="sentence" id="334">Palace was blown up, while the remained. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">Specialists walked around and said "Blow this one up, and leave this one alone," or else burn it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Another apparatus, whose German name I do not know, was designed to destroy completely sites that were found to have cultural significance, that is a translation from the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Those <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> that were cultural pillars. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">One of them was the <span class="BUILDING">Royal Palace</span> , and when one looks at photographs of the destruction, one sees that that was not regular mining work done there I have established that a special sort of coal dust was pumped into the <span class="INT_SPACE">basements</span> of such a <span class="BUILDING">building</span> , which was then detonated. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">That dust tore <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> apart into pieces the size of this cup. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">Nothing remained.</span></p>
