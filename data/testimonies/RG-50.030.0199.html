<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Would you tell me your full name please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  My name when I was born or the name today?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Both.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born as Naftali Salsitz and now my name is Norman Salsitz, but during the war I had a few different names.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="4">QUESTION:  We'll get to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">Tell me where you were born and when.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">ANSWER:  I was raised in a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="7">It's in <span class="REGION">southern Poland</span> it's named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> , and this belonged to the minor Poland. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">We called it in Polish Mourpoliska. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And before the first world war, it belonged to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Alsea</span> which was called <span class="REGION">Galicia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">In 1920.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Tell me a little bit about your parents and your family before the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="12">ANSWER:  Well, we were a very large family. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">We were nine children, five sisters and four brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">I was the youngest from the nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My father was a Hasidic Jew, very religious, my mother...the whole family was very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">He had a long grey beard and my mother was very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">She wear a Sheitel, which means a wig. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And everything was around Jewish tradition, Jewish religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I attended when I was 3 years, I started heder, which means a <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Til 3 years I had my hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">By 3 years, they cut off my hair, but they left side locks. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And after this heder when I was 6 years, I attended a small <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="23">They called it Yeshiva for the young boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I also started <span class="BUILDING">public school</span> , regular <span class="BUILDING">public schools</span> for which was together with the Polish boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And when I was 15 years I was sent out to a <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> to a very famous Rabbi in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> , a larger <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and which my father was a disciple of this Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">He was a follower, so he send me to his <span class="BUILDING">Yeshiva</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">And then when I came back...I wasn't there too long, because I wasn't very happy with it, I started to work in my father's business. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And my father had a <span class="BUILDING">wholesale store</span> in which we sold everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Now the <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> used to come to us and they bought the merchandise for their <span class="BUILDING">stores</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="30">So here you could call it a <span class="BUILDING">general store</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="31">We had there everything what was needed for a <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , we sold it. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">And it was quite a prosperous business. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> mostly, they were very poor Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">I would say 50 percent were poor, and 40 percent made a living, and 10 percent were rich Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">My father was considered to be among the 10 percent rich Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And this how we lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">It was a very close family. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">My sisters, when they were married, my father saw to it that they would remain in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="39">He gave them a dowry. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">He bought them a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and he established a business for them. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">What he used to do, he used to take a branch from our business and he gave it over to him and he took care of this on a wholesale level for this business. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And this we lived quite happily til the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">My oldest brother went to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> in 1919 one year before I was born because in 1919 we had the pogrom. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">The Poles came and they killed nine Jews, wounded 200, and this pogrom was for the celebration of gaining independence. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">So what 1s a better way to celebrate independence after so many years than to have a little pogrom. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">Not a big one, but at least nine people killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So after this, my oldest brother left and he came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So he didn't know me because I was born a year later. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">In 1933, my second brother left. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">He became a Zionist which all family was always in. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">There were Hasidic, but they always were, all the sisters belong to Zionist organizations and even my father was enough up-to-date that he was a Zionist. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">And my brother left in 1933 as a Chalutz, as a pioneer in this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So those brothers were out from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but the rest were living in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> til the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And it was a happy life. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">I was never satisfied with this life in this little stetl because I looked for something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="57">I wanted to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I wanted to go to <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="59">My dream was to become a doctor, but I was too young and I was maybe too weak to say to my father, "I want to take off this Hasidic clothing," which I always hated, "and to be like everybody else, to be a modern man.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="60">But it didn't come til a year before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">I joined the Zionist organization which was the Hanoar Hatzioni. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">It was the young movement and I was very happy because this was the tie that gave me a chance to belong to organization together with girls, which before I couldn't speak to her. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">There was special one girl which I fell in love when I was 12 years old, and I had a chance to be with her together with our other friends, and this was quite a happy time for me that I could get out of this burden of what my father wanted me to be a Hasidic boy to sit in the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and to study from morning til night.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  What happened when the war broke out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Well, then before the war we started to feel when the things happened to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we felt it in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="66">We felt it because the climate started to be...the Poles started to show their anti- Semitism a little more openly. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">Til 1935 was not so bad because til 1935, Pilsudki was the marshall in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and he was quite good for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And the minute Pilsudski died, a lot of tihngs happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">It changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Smidli took it over and then special laws came out against Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">The businesses started to be bad for Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">They opened cooperatives and slogans were all over and they used to say in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , [polish] [polish] means everybody to his own for his own. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">The small businesses lost everything because those cooperatives started small businesses in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="74">So what they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">peasants didn't sell their produce to Jews, so usually used to buy them, but they brought them to the <span class="BUILDING">cooperatives</span> and they used to exchange them for merchandise they needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">So they cut out the Jew who bought the produce and they cut out the Jew who sold them their merchandise. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">But we, our family didn't suffer because they were not enough advanced to have <span class="BUILDING">wholesale places</span> to supply the storekeepers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="78">So even there were more storekeepers in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , our business improved because they had to come to us for this merchandise to sell to the peasants in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="79">So we didn't feel it. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">But my father always said that this is only for a time being because eventually they will be enough advanced to start their own wholesale stores and their own manufacturing, that they will cut out even the wholesale letting the manufacture which was mostly in Jewish hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">So we knew this is only...in a short time, our business will go down also. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">And then the climate was so bad that everything what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from the papers we started to see, it started to happen in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="83">There was a time that they tried to forbid ritual slaughter for kosher meat which in the time of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pilsudski</span> would never happen, but it happened, but the Jews fought back and it didn't come to be that the slaughters should be forbidden. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Also, they organized ,they established a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> on the system that it was in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> tn this time because in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> even before the war, they had a few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , which starting with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">So they had in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breizakotuska</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="86">This was in the northern part in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">And what they brought in mostly, supposedly to be for communists which were enemies of the state, but also Jews who they thought didn't do such business, they did something wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">Instead to put them to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> or instead they give them fine, they brought them over to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , which was a very notorious <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="89">So all those things were prepared against the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Like for instance, there was the Prime Minister. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">His name was Slatkovski ?. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">He was a general, so he even was a very famous expression, when there was a debate about Jews and people say the Jews have to go out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , be thrown out of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , beaten up in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , so he said to beat up Jews no, but to destroy them economically he said ofshun. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">In Polish ofshun means by all means. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">So this was a very famous saying, ofshun, Prime Minister said that we have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Now, for instance, the...
QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I'm gonna have to break in if I may. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We need...for this interview, I want to talk about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">So let's focus on what happened to you.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Well, this I give you just a feeling how the situation and this was so in this time, I decided that I have to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , that this <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was not for me, so I had to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Now to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> wasn't so easy because where would you go to? </span><span class="sentence" id="102">I wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> because I became a Zionist and this was my dream. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> wasn't so easy. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">I was little too young, and then later you had to have a certificate from the English government and only a few got and a few were lucky in that. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">And so I decided to go illegal to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="106">So in 1938, I joined a groups that we paid in money and we're supposed to be smuggled to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> illegal to enter <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="107">So we had to pay 500 zlotys for it; 500 zlotys was quite a lot of money. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I decided with a friend of mine, he was a very close friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">Now this boy didn't have the 500 zlotys, so I remember the day when the letter came that we should pay it in, I paid in my 500 zlotys, and he didn't have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">So his mother had two silver candlesticks, probably from her mother, so she went and she had to sell the two candlesticks and still he didn't have the 200...the 500 zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">He was short 200, so I remember I gave him the 200 zlotys, and he said he would pay it back to me in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And we paid in and we were prepared and we waited to go, but this never came to be and the war in the middle started and we supposed to go in August and the war started in September, the Ist of September. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And this dream fell through. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">Also I wanted to come to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because I had here a brother, and all my father's brothers and sisters were here. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">My father was the only one who remained <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">So I wrote them letters and I begged them to send me papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">But none of them sent me papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">Only what they had to do 1s to invest 25 cents to go to another <span class="COUNTRY">Republic</span> and send me affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But they didn't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And when they didn't do it, so <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> was out. </span><span class="sentence" id="121"><span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> was out. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">So I had to stay there til the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Now, Ist of September the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">And it was a very bad feeling because we knew that this something terrible will happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Everybody there were rumors that the Polish army is strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We have a strong calvary, and they mobilized people, the older people. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">Now the Polish government, I don't know if they did it purposefully, if they had traitors there, because they mobilized old people. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">People who used to serve in the Austrian army in the first world war. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">The young people they didn't mobilize. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And so I felt that my duty, I felt myself as a Polish patriot. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">I wanted to be part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="132">I lived in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="133">So I went and I volunteered to the army soon as the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">They didn't accept me because they said they don't have enough uniforms for the regular army. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">How would they take me? </span><span class="sentence" id="136">So my parents naturally didn't know that I went and I volunteered. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">The feeling was that something terrible will happen and we awaited it. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">Now the Ist of September, the war broke out right a day, 2, 3 days later. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Thousands of refugee came through our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And most refugee who fled from the western part of <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> came to us and the reason why they came to us is because we didn't have a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">And there was a short cut from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> to cut through to the east, and usually when there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> the Germans used to bomb the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> and to shoot, so this way because there were <span class="DLF">fields</span> so they used to go through this <span class="DLF">route</span> , thousands and thousands, every day more and more. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And then later you could see the army broken up, broken units, and they came through our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">And Saturday, the 9th of September, the Germans came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And as we were never a lucky <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , like we had a pogrom; we had other things always happen in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">So Saturday morning the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">There were no Polish soldiers, so we figured there would not be no battle and the Germans will come and take the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So it happens at 12 o'clock, a new regiment came in that had run away and they said they're going to make a <span class="DLF">line</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="148">And the Germans came in about 3 o'clock, and there was a battle and there were 65 Germans killed and about 200 Polish soldiers, and there were about 150 Jewish civilians. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">Why Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="150">They didn't kill when there was a battle picking out Jews, but the Jews were the refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">They didn't know where to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">They mostly were Jews, because Poles didn't run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">They were not so much afraid so they were caught in the middle 1n a strange <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">And the atrocities started right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">They took us out in a open <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and they burned half of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">And we were in the middle and they came and they said that the battle, the fight was done by Jews, not by Polish soldiers, and for this reason they're going to burn alive all the Jews from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And they burned, they purposely started to burn the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> around where we were located. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">And we saw that maybe they will do these things, which they did not at the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">But it so happened in the evening, somebody came and they said, "No. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">They will let us go.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And they kept us for a whole night in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">The next day we came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and all the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were plundered, the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> which were not burned were plundered. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">The Germans stayed in there a half day. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They went in and took out everything they wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And we started to live under German occupation.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="166">QUESTION:  Can you slow down just a moment. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">Tell us what it was like for you under these conditions? </span><span class="sentence" id="168">What did it feel like you standing there watching all this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  When I was watching where we were in this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , surrounded and when they started to burn the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> around us and I saw there the young soldiers standing there and watching us and I looked at them and in this time I imagined myself being him. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">Being 1n a uniform, having a rifle in my hand, and he should be the victim. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And I was thinking, "Would I let him die, to be burned alive?" </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Because there were children started to cry and I wanted to compare myself what I would do in that case like this and I couldn't understand that they came and they occupy a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and take civilian people and kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">Because we were sure that they would keep their promise and they would burn us. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">So then later, the next day they started to take us to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And every day they came and they took out everybody and there was a lot of work. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">The whole Polish army was broken up and we had to clean the weapons and used shells from cannons and we used to load it on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to take away. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">Also, we had maybe a hundred dead horses because it happened that this unit which came to our town this day, this was a cavalry unit and when the fighting started, the horses were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">And the horses were laying dead, and this was still hot summer, so it start that we had to clean them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Now Jews were not used to such kind of work, bury horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">They were not strong enough for this. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">So we had to dig <span class="DLF">holes</span> and pull the horses and bury them because we were afraid of an epidemic. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">And so there were a case I remember that one Jew when we dug the horses, one officer came and he said to the Jew he didn't [like] him for some reason or other. </span><span class="sentence" id="183">And he said to go in in the <span class="DLF">hole</span> with the horse and we had to burn him too alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">And we started to cover and with the dirt. </span><span class="sentence" id="185">Then in the last minute his wife found out and she came and she screamed and begged and cried. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">Finally, he was almost buried completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">He said, "Alright, you can dig him out.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="188">In those [days] they started to harass the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">They used to take old Jews with long beards and they used to harness them to <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , and they used to sit on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and they used to pull them. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Just to show and make pictures and make a film. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">Everything to insult. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">In the beginning those insults were very bad, because we didn't know what awaits us. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">But everyday something else happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">And we got used to the yesterday's insults, but the next day there were more severe insults. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">So we forgot already what happened yesterday because we had to cope with the new one. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">And then later they gave out the curfew that Jews can only walk out from their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> between 10 in the morning til 12 noon, and then from 4 in the afternoon till 6. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">So you imagine only for the 2 hours to go out and to do everything what you had to do for the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Naturally, nobody did business anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">They confiscated the merchandise. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">They took away everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">And in the 2 hours you could see everybody was running, running, running because you wanted to do, to accomplish in the 2 hours what he could do in a whole day. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And then later he was in a hurry to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , not to be caught in the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So those were the harassments. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Then later it came the harassments which couldn't walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="205">We had to walk on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="206">The first day it was terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="207">What you mean I cannot walk on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="208">But later we got used to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">We got used to it, so we walked on the <span class="DLF">street</span> and if somebody walked on the <span class="DLF">sidewalk</span> in the beginning they didn't shoot us, but they arrested them. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">Then later came out a order that every Jew who saw a German on the <span class="DLF">street</span> had to take off his hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">He had to greet him. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Now, so they were cases like in my father for instance, I remember, there came a young German policeman, so he took off his hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">So he went to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">He started to beat him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And he beat him up and he said, "Why do you beat me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="216">He says, "Well, because why you taking off the hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">Why you greeting me? </span><span class="sentence" id="218">What am I? </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Your friend? </span><span class="sentence" id="220">You are a dirty, lousy Jew and I'm a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">Why am I your friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Why you greeting me?" </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So the next day, when he saw a German, he didn't take off the hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">So he went and he beat him up. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">And he said, "How long do we have to teach you when you see a German you should take off up your hat, take off your hat and bow because you are subhuman and..... So everything what they did, 1t was only to make life miserable. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">And then the war, of course, very bad because every day they caught the same people and they took them away to all kind of work, to clean the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="227">And then the Poles were standing and laughing and enjoying because they didn't touch them and they were very[helpful?] </span><span class="sentence" id="228">and if sometimes the Germans didn't know where the Jews lived, the Poles...usually the young Polish boys used to go with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">They couldn't speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">One word they learned very fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">Jude. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">Jude. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">So they went with the Germans and they used to show the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Jude. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">Jude. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Jude. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">That there lives a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So the Germans went in and took out everybody and dragged them to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Now the work was done and they didn't pay for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">The people were hungry. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">They couldn't make a few zlotys 1n their profession or something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">They had to go from morning til night to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">And the worst time was in the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">In the winter we had to clear the <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">From far away, kilometers away, for the Germans that their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> should be able to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">So we had to stay in the snow from morning til night. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">Even when the snow was falling down, we still had to clean. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">So we sometimes asked, "What's the use to clean up? </span><span class="sentence" id="249">In 5 minutes they will be covered with snow again?" </span><span class="sentence" id="250">But nevertheless, we had to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And I was with the Germans about a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Then something happened to my father, somebody, one of his friends denounced him to the Germans that we had hidden merchandise and the Germans took away everything we had from our <span class="BUILDING">warehouses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="253">They cleared out everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">They didn't leave anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="255">And I said to this man...I threatened him and I said to him, "Someday, I will pay you back for it.‚Äô </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And he went to the Germans and he told them that I'm a very dangerous. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">I was at this time 19 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">I was a boy from the Yeshiva from a <span class="BUILDING">Rabbinical school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Before the war, I wore the long peijes. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">And he told them that I belonged before the war to a communist party which was against...and that I'm dangerous to the Germans, and I also said that I will go and to do some sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">This what he told the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="262">Now, they didn't know me, so they said that tomorrow we're gonna arrest him and we shoot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">I find out about it and I run away to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="264">To the <span class="REGION">Russia zone</span> because <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> was divided. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The <span class="REGION">western part</span> was taken over by the Germans, and the <span class="REGION">eastern part</span> was taken over by the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">So I went over to the <span class="REGION">Russian zone</span> and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemberg</span> [<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> ]. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">And I was very happy in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemberg</span> because there I joined a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> which I always dreamed about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And I also joined a Jewish theatrical group. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">There was a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish theatre</span> and I always I said, "If I cannot be a doctor, I want to be an actor.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I always had it in my blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And even in <span class="BUILDING">home</span> before the war when we used to make like plays for a holiday for Hanukkah for Purim, every year our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> made the play. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">And I always had the lead in this play and I used to sing by a cantor. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">I had a voice soprano, so the cantor liked me and I used to sing solos. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemberg</span> and my dream was fulfilled. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">I went to a <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> and I joined a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> so I could play...be a part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">So I said, "Well, the war will last maybe a year or two, and I will meanwhile do what I want to do.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Meanwhile, I found out, I was there 3 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I find out that my girlfriend which I liked...her mother is gravely ill and she was only with her mother because her father and brother and sister were on the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So I find out about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">I decided to come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And I came back to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">And I will never forget, this was already in January. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">We had to put white sheets over us to camouflage the snow and we went through the <span class="DLF">border</span> and we were caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Those are long stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">I don't want to dwell on how we were caught by the Russians, and then they had to take us to <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemberg</span> , back to <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="286">We knew once we are in the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , so after from the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , they send us to <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So during the night, we overpowered the guards and we tied them down with blankets. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We took away their rifles, and we went back to the <span class="DLF">border</span> and this time we managed to cross the <span class="DLF">border</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="289">QUESTION:  Who is... Slow down. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">We have plenty of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Who is we?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="292">ANSWER:  Well, there was one man. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Before the war, he was a horse dealer. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And he lived in the <span class="REGION">section</span> where the <span class="DLF">border</span> is. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> 's name was Jarloslaw. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">It was known that every week he takes a group of people who want to go to back. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">And when we came back he took a group of people who want to run away from the <span class="REGION">German side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="298">So he was like a smuggler. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">He was a Jewish man. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">And he took at this time 15 boys from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> who wanted to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">Because 1n the beginning they couldn't make a living in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lemberg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="302">It was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">There were thousands and thousands of refugees. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">They didn't have where to live, where to sleep. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">So here somebody told us that the Jews live in their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">It's bad under the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">They have to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">They have to do certain things. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">But the atrocities didn't start night in the beginning, so they figured they will come <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because on account of this girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Maybe subconsciously I wanted to be with the family too. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">And I will never forget the day that I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , my father was sitting in our <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> studying some Talmud, and I came in and he saw me and I said, "I'm back.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="313">And he didn't lift his eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">While looking still in the book, he said, "As much as I am happy to see you, you made the biggest mistake in your life that you came back.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="315">Those were his words when he saw me when I came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">And naturally when I came back the first week, I was hiding because I was afraid that somebody would say, "The police.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="317">because I remembered that they wanted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">But this was already new police, and nobody remembered and I joined the Jews with their misery in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> going to work and starting to do business and my father still had this little <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , but it was little in this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">But he didn't come in in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , because he was a Jew with a long beard and it was like a red cloth when you want to aggravate a bull. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So my sisters were in the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> and I started to travel to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , and brought in merchandise, mostly <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="321">And this how we started to make a living. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And I was the young in the family, so I had to do it, and I did it to support all my sisters because I had the three married sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">Their husbands were not capable to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">They were very religious Jews with the beards and I was young. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">They didn't speak so good Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">So I used to travel every day someplace else and to bring in merchandise and to sell it and to make money. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">And we worked like this til about spring of 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">Spring of 1940, they made a registration, so all the Jews had to be registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">And then they used to make like...there came a few high officers from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> , and they took us in a big <span class="BUILDING">building</span> and they made like a selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">From the people who were registered, they picked out at this time 200 young boys and we had to come to the <span class="NPIP">places</span> where <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> were waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">And they send us to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="332">This was the first time they made this registration. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">And the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> was in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Leipyia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">This was near a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Novisanz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="335">This was near the <span class="DLF">southern border</span> this was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Carpathian mountains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="336">Our work was that we had to break rocks. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">It was like a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> where we had to break rocks, but the problem was that what we did...when we broke up the rocks we had to transport them to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> on hand <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , on wheel barrels, and the next day we took the same rocks and we brought them back to the first <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And this was our work. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">It was very hard work. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">And they gave us very little food. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">But 1t wasn't so bad because in this time, this was in 1940, our people in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> still lived in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="342">They still had what to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> could send...we could send packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">So the community from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> used to send every week a package to every prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">And they send it to the community of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novasanz</span> , of this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="346">And this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> brought it us to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="347">So we had enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">After 2 or 3 months, we started to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">And all of us run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And the Germans didn't even look for us even run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">What did they do? </span><span class="sentence" id="352">When everybody run away, they had from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , also young people, so they went to other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and brought in other <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="353">So they didn't bother looking for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So I came back from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and I started to work by the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So they took me and we started to build <span class="BUILDING">garages</span> for the Wehrmacht. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">And they accepted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">They also made us register, they looked us over who is young and strong, so because of my work. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">So everyday I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="359">They didn't pay us for the work, but I was glad to go to work for them so they wouldn't catch me to work different work like cleaning the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , cleaning the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Because I had to go work anyways. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">At least I went in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I had a pass that nobody should grab me from the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="363">And we worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">And once being with those Germans or working in the <span class="BUILDING">garages</span> , so I used to buy for them a quart of kerosene, a loaf of bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="365">I used to bring to the Germans a few eggs, and we exchanged this. </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And it was there where I worked. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">And sisters were 1n the <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , and they did some business buying this from peasants and selling some produce. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">It was not like before the war, but we thought it 1s bad, but somehow we will survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">They didn't kill at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">But Jews for every little things were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">They were harassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">And they caught the slaughter the Shochet who used to slaughter for a kosher meat, so they arrested him. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">After 2 weeks, they paid a lot of ransom...they paid money, they let him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">And everything was done with money, you could buy yourself out by the German police. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">And we still lived in our <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , so it wasn't so bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">But we knew that we are under German occupation, and also we heard stories from other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> about atrocities. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">There was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Mielec</span> , for instance, not far from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so when the Germans came in, they took about 200 Jews and they put them in in the <span class="BUILDING">shul</span> , in the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , and also in the <span class="INT_SPACE">public bath</span> and they closed the <span class="DLF">doors</span> and they burned the people with the <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="378">QUESTION:  Do you see that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="379">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">This I didn't see, but this was in the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="383">So we heard about atrocities from different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , but they asked...1t was just arresting contribution...we had to pay money, but nothing terrible happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">Until in the fall of 1940, they came, they established a very notorious <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> near us named <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow</span> was an <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">SS camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Now <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow</span> was established because this was the place where they started experiments for the V-1, V-2, rockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">This is the first what they did it, and they picked out this <span class="NPIP">place</span> because there were a lot of <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="387">In <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , there was a section, it was called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pushun Sandomerska</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="388">It means the wilderness of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sandomierz</span> , the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Before the 18th century practically, nobody could go through it. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">It was old, <span class="ENV_FEATURES">virgin forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">Later, people started to make <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="392">In this section of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow Sandomerzko</span> , they made the first experiments. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">They brought in Jews and Poles too, and they worked there for a certain time. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Later, they killed the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">They were afraid that they would run away and they would start to tell stories about those experiments. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">I remember that during the day, three or four times you could hear a boom, a noise, but you didn't see a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">You didn't see anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">You could hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">It sound like something is flying then noise, then it was an explosion in the <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="400">You could see a ball of fire and it disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">And this happened a few times a days, so this were the experiments that they used to shoot the rockets, but they exploded. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">Then later when the rockets exploded, then on the places pieces of cast aluminum used to fall on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">Now the peasants used to collect it and they used to make utensils, spoons, jars, cups, everything they used to make from this. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">So the Germans didn't want it should be, and they used to send out special police to go and collect those items. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">And this came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">So in 1941, at the end of 40, I was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="407">Again, there came a commission, and they took the young people and they looked through and while they picked out the people, they beat up everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">And I remember I was beaten up terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">I was standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> , then somebody and I didn't move so fast, so SS men with their rifle butt hit me in the back and I flew to the front and I feel down and I was all bleeding. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">So the man who was in charge, his name was Schmidt. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">He was a Feldwebel, I mean a Scharfuhrer from the SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And he saw me on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , so they picked me up, and I was bleeding from my mouth, from my nose. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">So he came out and he said, "Hey, what happened to you?" </span><span class="sentence" id="414">Like not...he joked around. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">So he took out a handkerchief and he gave the handkerchief I should wipe the blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">So I wiped the blood. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">He said, "Now, clean my boots.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="418">So with my blood, I had to take and I had to wipe his boots with the blood.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="419">So those were the things that they were terrible in this time, but looking back those were things that you could survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">They were terrible, but it was not extermination. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">It was not killing off everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">But in this time, those were the bad things. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">So I was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">They were so vicious that when they took us on open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> and they took in this maybe 100 from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> in the open <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> , when we traveled, they took us by the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="425">The driver purposefully, in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> on the <span class="DLF">road</span> , on both sides, there were <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="426">Now <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> were not high so he purposely drove the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> under the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> where the branches were sticking out and the people should be hurt, and a few of them were hurt. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">It cut open their heads and all that because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> went in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">branches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="428">I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow</span> about 6 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">During the time, every night was there a ritual. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">When there was the appell, this Schmidt picked out somebody and he was hanged. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">We all had to watch by the appell how the man was hanged. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">And usually he picked out somebody of us, and he was the hangman. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">Now there were times in the books that I am writing there and I give more details, so there was a times that he picked somebody who didn't want to hang the other Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">So he took a knife and he cut his throat because he didn't want to hang him. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">And also this Schmidt had a habit, when we walked to work we cut <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> because they wanted to make the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> a little larger, so he used to shoot just in our rank, in our column. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">Not aiming. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">So once I was hit in my right arm. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And it was very difficult to work because the hand, but he didn't do no damage and I with somebody's help, I was transferred to other detail to put up <span class="DLF">telephone poles</span> through the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And one time when I lifted a <span class="DLF">telephone pole</span> , I dislocated a disc in my neck and I couldn't straighten out. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">And then I knew that if I would be there and they would find out that this happen, they would shoot me because what do they need a man with a dislocated disc? </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And then with the help of somebody I escaped, and I came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="442">01:40
QUESTION:  Let's back up again. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">Tell us, again...slow down. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">Tell us how you escaped.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="445">ANSWER:  Well, when I was shot, so the Germans, they didn't know would be tied down to 1, 10 men. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">I went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">It was hard too, because we worked there cutting the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">trees</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So it was hard, but with the help with others, they covered me. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">You know, in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> the comradeship, the friendship was so big that everybody would do everything for his friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">Even we were strangers we became so friendly that at times even they would endanger their lives to help their other friend. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">So they covered, but when I dislocated a disc it was very bad for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">I used to hold on to two guys when we worked I should be a little straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="453">And I knew that I would not be able to hide this a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">So there was a man who was in charge of the Jewish columns. </span><span class="sentence" id="455">It so happens that this man was a cousin of my girlfriend. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">And I told him this. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">His name was Kleinhandler from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="458">And he was the head, he was like a middle man between the workers of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pruszkow camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So through him, he recommended me to somebody else and through the other man helped me to escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">He opened a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> when I went to work...a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town Bembitza</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="461">And he told me to go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> , and they took me away. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">Because the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">SS truck</span> , but he had to pick out so many workers to go to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> so he picked me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">He knew that I have his name, I remember even was Immergluck . </span><span class="sentence" id="464">And he was not very much liked, because he did things that he didn't have to do to the Jewish workers. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But to me, he was good because this other friend told him to do it, so he picked me up and they helped me go on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and they took me to work supposedly to the Bembitza to bring some merchandise or to bring some supplies. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">So I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bembitza</span> , the Jews were still there, so I didn't go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">And that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">They didn't look for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I started to wear a brace. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And then later after a few weeks, it healed. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">I had problems later, but I could walk out. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">I came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="473">The situation started to be much worse, every day, every day, you could see that the situation 1s worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Then later we received, we got in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> a Land Kommissar which is the head of the county, because our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was the county seat, and there came a Land commissar, and his name was Farting. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">And he was the biggest sadist ever lived. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">And he was a German, but he also was a Polish guy, because he spoke German and Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">And this was very bad, because he could speak to the Polish people and he could find out a lot of things which was not healthy for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">So this Farding came to us as a LandKommissar._Before he used to be in the Gestapo in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="479">So they said and we used to say he is so bad because he has all bad things from both <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> , the bad things from the Germans and the bad things from the Poles, and he combined it in one person. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">He looked like a caricature. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">He was short, very fat, with a big belly, a shaved head which in the sun it was gleaming like a mirror, small little eyes like a pig, very small piercing eyes, and he had a voice that it was like a shrilled voice, like it came from animal or something, very shrill you say, and he was very shrewd, very smart. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">And he wanted to outsmart everybody, but he was very vicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">So when he came he organized a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="484">And our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was organized before large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> had <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because we already had a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in June 1941, which was very early. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">And he pushed into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , where before used to be 70 Poles, he put in 2,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And it was very cramped. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">And we lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="488">And then we had an old man who was the President of the Judenrat, which was a Doctor Unterman. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">And I think this Doctor Unterman should be remembered. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">If the Jews would have in their religion to make a saint of somebody, I think he should have been the first saint. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">Because being that president of the Judenrat, he actually sacrificed his life for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Before the war, this Doctor Unterman didn't consider himself a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">He was a assimilated Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">He never bothered with Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">He never belonged to a <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="496">He never even stepped in a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish temple</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="497">Only had his friends with the Polish people because he was a Polish officer, and was a Polish patriot, and he was considered by them that he was one of the most important people in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="498">But with Jews he never had anything to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">He had Jewish, had Jewish patients, but that's all. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">When the war started he saw that he can speak to the Germans different than a Jew with a long beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">He was clean shaven. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">He was a captain in the Austrian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">He studied medicine in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> , spoke beautiful German, and he could stand up to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">Now, again, he couldn't understand that the Germans will be so vicious and he thought with him they will think twice. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">So he agreed to become the president, which before he said, "What I have nothing to do with Jews?" </span><span class="sentence" id="506">But later, we convinced him and he said he will become president if he would pick out 12 people which he liked with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">And he picked out 12 younger people, Jews without beards, people who were outstanding citizens before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">Honest people. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">Fine people. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">And he said, "If they will be with me in the Judenrat, then I will be come the Hauptman. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">And they agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">As a matter of fact, between the 12 people, he picked out my older brother and my brother-in-law he was one of the 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">And he ran this Judenrot that I don't think so that any Judenrot was run like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">He was so honest. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">I don't know if we should go in details, but Linda, I'll give you two examples. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">Once they brought in, they gave to the Jews to divide pieces of soap, to give every family a piece of soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And the Judenrat divided the soap. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">And then about 5 kilo soap was left. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">It was more than they...so the Judenrat, the man who was in charge of dividing the soap, he made 13 packages to give what's left over to each member of the Judenrat to take <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="520">And one was for Dr. Unterman. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">And Dr. Unterman came in, and they said, "This is for you.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="522">He said, "What is it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="523">He said, "Well, this is the soap.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="524">He says, "But I already got soap, what I suppose to get.‚Äù "</span><span class="sentence" id="525">Well, this was left.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="526">And they explained it. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">And he said, "It was left and how much?" </span><span class="sentence" id="528">And they said, "We made 13 packages.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="529">He said, "I want to see the 13 packages.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="530">So they brought back what everybody took for himself. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">He opened it and he said, "Give me a list of 13 poorest Jews in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="532">So they picked out 13 poor Jews. "</span><span class="sentence" id="533">I want everybody should get a package. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">Not you. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">Not I.‚Äù And he divided...this kind of man way he was. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">Like to the Germans he spoke to them like to equals. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">Like this Farding who came in, he wanted to take over Unterman's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because he built this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> a year before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">And because he was a physician he was well off. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">And he built a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and this was the only <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that had electricity. </span><span class="sentence" id="540">He had his own generator. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">The only one in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that he had indoor plumbing. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">He made it a beautiful <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="543">So naturally, Farding wanted this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="544">So he asked him, "I want to move in. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">Why don't you move in into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="546">So he told him, "In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> I will move 1n til the last Jew will have a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over his head. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">So long as the last Jew doesn't have a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over his head, I will not move in.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Then later this Farding said, "The Judenrat will have to pay 10,000 zlotys to me to renovate the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="549">He said, "Renovate? </span><span class="sentence" id="550">I just built 1t. And besides if I could live 1n it, you can live in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="551">And then why should you renovate. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">After the war will end, I will come back to my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="553">You will go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Now he didn't like this thing, we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> about 2 weeks, he took the whole Judenrat with Dr. Unterman and he arrested them and they were sitting in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> about a week or 2 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">They they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> and from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszowize</span> they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="556">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , there were orders was right in the beginning. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">This was in the fall of 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">In this time, you hardly knew that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> exists. </span><span class="sentence" id="559">And then they were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> , and after 2, 3 weeks, telegrams started to come to the families, and the telegram said that your husband died on cancer. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Other one your husband died on heart attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="561">Your husband died while he was running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">And then it was a letter that the widow had to sign that her husband suffered for cancer for 2 years, that her husband had heart trouble for 4 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Why they did it, why this evidence they needed, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">But they had to sign a letter that he actually was sickly and to add salt to the wound, everybody received a bill for the <span class="BUILDING">cremation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="565">They said people were cremated and the <span class="BUILDING">cremation</span> cost so and so much, and you will have to pay the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">So every widow had to pay money for the <span class="BUILDING">cremation</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Now when the Judenrot was liquidated, naturally, Fardring organized a new Judenrot. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">But [for] this Judenrat he already picked out people who he liked. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">And this Judenrat, I wouldn't say that they were murderers, but they were more to the liking of the Germans than Dr. Unterman. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">That the old man of this Judenrat wouldn't go out and wouldn't, if there was left there 13 packages of soap, he wouldn't say divide it to the poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="571">He probably would say I want the whole 13 packages. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">This was a different. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">And then it was life started to be more and more terrible. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">Another [thing] I want to tell you about is Dr. Unterman. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">When he saw that the Jews are so poor and they cannot afford a doctor, so he organized an ambulatorium. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">And every day he gave 2 hours, he was sitting in the <span class="BUILDING">ambulatorium</span> , and this was in my sister's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and everybody who was sick who couldn't pay could come to him, and he treated the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="577">And then later the Judenrat had to pay for medicine what they received. </span><span class="sentence" id="578">Because he liked me, so he took me in the ambulatorium I should be his assistant. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">As I mentioned before, I always wanted to be a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="580">So I worked with him and he taught me how to open wounds, how to clean wounds, how to put in all kinds of ointments, how to bandage, all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">And I worked with him every day and he showed me all these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">This gave me opportunity when we were later in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> , which we come to it, and we were in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> I became the doctor, the so-called doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="583">We had to do some medically, I always had that little suitcase with all kind of instruments which I inherited after he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">And I had this and I used to treat the people as much as I could, as much as he taught me. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">So this Doctor Unterman got killed, and the Judenrat got killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">He had a wife with a son, and his wife, after he was arrested, the wife with the son escaped to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> and they lived as Aryans, illegal people, Poles, illegal papers which they could very easily survive because they didn't look Jewish, and their language was only Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">And during the uprising, not the ghetto uprising, but the general uprising in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , her son was a officer of the AK, the Polish underground, and he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">She survived and came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , and after the war and since then she died. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">So men like this should be remembered because we didn't have too many people like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">Actually, the Poles begged him to escape from <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> , and they wanted to take him and hide him and do anything for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">And he said, "I cannot do it, because I cannot leave the Jews, because nobody will stick up for them.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="592">And he thought that he would be able to speak up, and then later they got rid of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">Now once he was killed yes, also under his administration, because you asked me I should tell about me. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">Because I before the war, I 01:55 worked in my <span class="BUILDING">father's store</span> and I used to go to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> buying all kind of merchandise for our <span class="BUILDING">store</span> , I knew the suppliers. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">I knew the ways how to buy and bring in the stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">And also when I left our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , we had to wear the arm band, a white arm band with a blue star of David. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">Every time I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , the first thing I took off my arm band. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">And I traveled, nobody stopped me and it so happens that I was never, never stopped for questioning that I'm a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">I look so Polish, more than the Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">So I never was suspected, so it was easy for me to go because and then later to bring in merchandise as a non-Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">So Unterman picked me out and I was the one who used to go to different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and to bring in merchandise for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="602">Now, we later organized a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> for the people to come in to have a warm meal once a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="603">Now when we had to buy those things we didn't receive as for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> on card, but we had to buy like potatoes, flour and other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="604">So I used to go out to the peasants and used to buy it and bring it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">And I did it for the Judenrat. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">Now, also the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> received flour for baking bread, and each family recetved so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">Sometimes two 01:57: loaves a week, sometimes | loaf a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">This had to brought in. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">So I used to go to the <span class="BUILDING">flour mills</span> and bring it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">This was officially I brought it in. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">We used to get sugar. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">We used to get marmalade. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">We used to get other things...supplies what the Germans get. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">And this we used to get in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="615">So I went twice a week, once a week, with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> and I brought this in and this was my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="616">Instead to go and work on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and clean the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , so this was my job that Unterman assigned me to. </span><span class="sentence" id="617">And for me, it was very good because when I went to buy all those things, I always brought something on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="618">Paid extra money, and together with this merchandise, I could bring it in and then later to supply my family and to sell something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">This went on til he was arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">When the new old man [Aeltester] .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="621">QUESTION:  Excuse me. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">This is a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> to stop and break and change tapes. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  You were telling us about you bringing in the supplies in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="624">ANSWER:  So when the second Judenrat came into power...meanwhile, we had all kind of new orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Orders like to give up all the furs, and if somebody would have a fur, and they would be caught with a piece of fur in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and would be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">So naturally most of the Jews gave the Germans the furs. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">I remember there came a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">QUESTION:  Gave them what?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="629">ANSWER:  Fur. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">Fur. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">Fur. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">And then they had collars and fur, they gave them. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">And it was not a rich <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , so you could see somebody had there a coat with a fur lining, it was maybe a 100 years [old] or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">It was all falling apart. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">But they brought it over. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">Everybody was afraid. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">Some younger woman had Persian Lamb coats because this was the style. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">So some didn't give the Persian Lamb coats because it was valuable, so we used to hide it or give it to peasants to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">I remember one of my sisters had a Persian Lamb coat, so she gave it to me and I brought it out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to somebody who we trusted and they should hide it for us, which by the way they never gave it back to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="640">And then there were other contributions. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Once this Farding came in and he said he wants to have 10 kilo of gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">Ten kilo of gold in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...they were poor Jews...how could they could, but I knew how. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">But this new president from the Judenrot, his name was Pashek Rappaport. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">He was very energetic. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">And people were sometimes afraid of him. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">So he somehow managed to get together the 10 kilo gold to give it to Farding. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And when they gave it to Farding, so he said, "You know, you saved 20 Jewish lives with it because I was prepared to kill 20 people if you wouldn't give that 20 kilo gold.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="648">I remember to the gold, everybody gave what he had, a wedding band, a pair of earrings, but 10 kilo is a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="649">So I remember there was still missing, this night I will never forget that my father came and he brought a package and he opened it and he had there, he said I'm going to give this too to save lives, so he opened it and there was a gold watch on a long chain like in this time the women used to wear a gold chain with a watch and also he had in this package a cigarette box from gold. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">So he said, "I'm going to give it. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">You see when I was engaged with your mother," he told me, "I gave her this watch, and she gave me this cigarette and I saved it through the first world war. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I had it hidden, and now I'm going to give it.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And he gave it. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">And now the Jews gave...and we came up with the 10 kilo gold and then he said we saved so many lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And every day new atrocities a new one on top of one [that] was not finished, the other came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">The other came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">We lived in this time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="658">We were fortunate that my brother's <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , so we could move into his, so he had two <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> , SO we moved in in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and he had one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I had three married sisters, so one of my sisters lived in the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was with the other two sisters moved in. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">So somehow I was appointed by the new Judenrot to my old job to go to other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> and to bring in the merchandise which was very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">But in December of 1941, I went once to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> , and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszowi</span> was a epidemic of dysentery. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And a lot of people died. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And I ate there. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">I remember I bought two tomatoes, and I ate the two tomatoes and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I had dysentery. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">And this was very dangerous because with the Germans, because this was very contagious and when the Germans find out that there is somebody with dysentery, probably they would have me killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">So we didn't tell nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I went to the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , and my younger sister which was the dearest to me because we were the closest in age. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">She was 3 years older. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">Her name was Rachel. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">And we decided I would be on the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="671">We wouldn't tell nobody, and she was with me during all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">She used to give me food, what I could eat, and she used to take away from me what was necessary because it had to buried because the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">And I somehow survived this dysentery. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">We didn't have no injections. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">We didn't have no doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">And as I recuperated I got middle ear infection, and I started to have terrible pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">And, again, no doctor so home remedies. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">We used to put in oil and this and that and it went on and on and got worse and worse and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">And after 3 weeks, the pains were so terrible, I cannot describe the pains because everything was infected. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">So this was in the winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">Somehow my brother got a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">sleigh</span> with somebody, and they took me out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and they brought me to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> , to Dr. Heller. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">He was a. It was a specialist for ear, throat and nose. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And he said that I have to have an operation right away. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">If I wouldn't have operation, I would die because all the puss was around the brain, but he cannot operate. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">There is no facilities. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">There are no <span class="BUILDING">Jewish hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> , and I cannot go to a non-Jewish hospital. </span><span class="sentence" id="687">So I went there with my sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="688">I was there with my sisters. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So I have to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="690">How can you go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="691">Jews are not permitted to ride by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="692">So my brother went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> and somehow he managed to get a false...from this Rappaport some that he had, a pass signed by this Earding, by this Land Kommissar, but it was not made out to nobody, so he made out my name with my sisters and they took me, with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="693">On the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , a young Polish boy came up and he saw that there are three Jews, my two sisters and myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">He said, "What are Jews doing on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="695">He said, "I'm coming now from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="696">I work in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="697">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , they wouldn't allow Jews on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="698">And he started to speak to the rest of the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">He said, "We cannot have Jews on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="700">We have to throw them out.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="701">And they came to us and they wanted to throw us out from the running <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="702">So my sister started to cry and to beg. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">They said, "Look this man...this boy is almost dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">He's so sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="705">He needs an operations.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="706">My head was all with bandages. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">So some people they said, "Well, Let's...let's wait til a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="708">There was a <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="709">So this man went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">He brought up two policemen, German policemen, and he said, "I want you should throw them down because they are Jews.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="711">So we showed him the papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">So the policeman said, "What...we cannot do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">They have the Passier Schein.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="714">That means they have a pass for travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">So again they started to yell, "Oh, we don't want to travel with Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">So we will throw them out.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Again the same story, and my sisters begged them so they said okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">We'll not throw you out, but the next stop you have to go out. </span><span class="sentence" id="719">So we had to choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="720">The next stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">Meanwhile, they caught the other Jew, and they threw him out from the running <span class="BUILDING">station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="722">Not the Germans, the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">So the next <span class="BUILDING">station</span> we stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">So happens that it was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="725">And <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> was quite a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="726">I knew <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> because I went to the Yeshiva in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> , and we had there a cousin. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">We came to the cousin and we were very lucky that in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> there was a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">His name was David Rabinowitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">And this David Rabinowitz, he was the chief surgeon in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> in a <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> in the name of Poznanski, a very rich manufacturer. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">And he was thrown out from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> and he came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tarnow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="731">So we came to him, and he looked at me and he said, "I don't think so we can do anything to this boy because it's too long. </span><span class="sentence" id="732">Everything is already full with puss.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="733">But anyway, they made an operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">The operation took 8 hours, and he operated and he said, "Well, he will be deaf or blind or something or he will die.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="735">But anyway, he operated so that after 3, 4 weeks my hearing came back and when he operated he even cut the drum for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">puss</span> to come out, and then later he sew it. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">He was a wonderful man and I became alright and I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with my head all bandaged and in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> they already spoke about it that I'm dead already. </span><span class="sentence" id="737">Now I want to tell you what happened to this David Rabinowitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">He was such a wonderful surgeon, such a wonderful man;a Jewish doctor couldn't operate on a Gentile. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">But there was a case that somebody was very sick on the same thing and there was not a Polish doctor he should do this operation because it was a very delicate operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="740">They came to him, and he told them, "I cannot operate on a non-Jew.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="741">So they said, "Listen, you have to save this man.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="742">He went and he operated.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="743">And he saved him. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">About a week later, a brother-in-law of the man who was operated...a Polish guy also, went to the Germans and he told them that this Rabinowitz operated on his brother-in-law. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">They came to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , and from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> they they dragged him out to the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , and they shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="746">They shot him because he operated a non-Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="747">And he saved him. </span><span class="sentence" id="748">Well, those were the times. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">So when I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , the whole situation in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> was already different. </span><span class="sentence" id="750">During the 3 months, everything was pushed toward the end and we didn't know in this time that are <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> , <span class="INT_SPACE">gas chambers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="751">This was in April 1942, and this time you didn't have any transports yet, but we could feel from the Germans' behavior that every day something else came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">When I came back so I got back my job. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">Instead to go to work, I got back my job to go for merchandise from the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , and I got the pass. </span><span class="sentence" id="754">I took over the ambulatorium from Dr. Unterman and I got all his instruments and I got medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">I already knew what medicines applied to this and which medicine applied to his, and I bought in the Apotheke more medicine so I got a pass that I am in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gesundheitsdienst</span> , which means a health service, that I could go out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> if it's needed, which was very helpful. </span><span class="sentence" id="756">And we lived again in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And this was the 28th of April, the 28th of April, 1942, we were sitting <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and we had dinner cause dinner was not at night, but dinner was around 12, | o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And what the dinner was, probably a tomato soup, a potato soup, something very austere. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">So we were sitting, and then we hear somebody knocking on the <span class="DLF">door</span> downstairs, and from the knocking we right away knew it's Germans because this was their knocking. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Not knocking, banging. </span><span class="sentence" id="761">And somebody looked through the <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">They saw two Gestapo men standing, because their uniforms, the Gestapo had uniforms with SS, and we knew their banging. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">So the first thing my sisters bolted the <span class="DLF">door</span> from the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , and the first thing was to hide the men, because in this time we thought the men are most vulnerable. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">So my brother and I we were <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , so we ran out through the <span class="DLF">back door</span> through the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="765">We run out to a neighbor, and we run to the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="766">We thought maybe they come to us, they will not go to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="767">My sister took my father and they put him in the <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and put in a padlock on the <span class="DLF">door</span> to make believe that nobody is there because the padlock is on the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="768">And he was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">They were banging and banging. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">When they saw that not nobody opens and they cannot break down the <span class="DLF">door</span> , one of the Gestapo went around the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> to see to go from the <span class="DLF">back entrance</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="771">And then my sister was afraid that maybe it's not a good <span class="NPIP">place</span> for my father to be there because they keep banging. </span><span class="sentence" id="772">Maybe he should go where I am hiding, so she went and she opened the 02:14: <span class="BUILDING">outhouse</span> and let out my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="773">In this moment, the other Gestapo came from the back and he faced my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">He first thing, he had a list and he asked my father, "What's your name?" </span><span class="sentence" id="775">My father knew that if somebody would be on the list, he would be on the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">So he said, "My name is Salich.‚Äù‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Was Salsitz, but Salich. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">He looked. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">He didn't see no Salich. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Meanwhile, they dragged out the other...you know when that men from the front broke down the <span class="DLF">door</span> , he took out the other man with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="781">His name was Hoofer. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">He was not on the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="783">And he took him to the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , and he asked this Hoofer, "What is this man's name?" </span><span class="sentence" id="784">And he said, "Salsitz.‚Äô‚Äô </span><span class="sentence" id="785">He didn't know why, what, so he said, "Salsitz.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="786">Well, so they had him on the list, so they told the other man to go back and they took my father and started to push him towards a <span class="BUILDING">wood shed</span> which was in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="787">And, naturally, we knew, they took out the revolvers, we knew what it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So my two sisters, my single two sisters were with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="789">They started to scream and they runned to the Gestapo men to try to take out their revolvers. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">Why they didn't shoot them I don't understand til now. </span><span class="sentence" id="791">So one [sister], the older one, Maddle, went to one and she grabbed his hand and she tried to pull out the revolver from him so he took the revolver and hit her over the head and the head started to bleed and she fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">When my second sister, the youngest sister, she was 3 years older than I, saw this. </span><span class="sentence" id="793">She run to the second one and started to twist his hand and take out the revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="794">He did the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">He hit her til she fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">And they took my father and they pushed him in this <span class="BUILDING">wood shed</span> and I could hear two shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">Now those shots were the loudest shots I ever heard in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">They were something so loud that til today, I hear them. </span><span class="sentence" id="799">Til today when I wake up at night, I could hear those two shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="800">It was something, and I saw them going in the woodshed from this <span class="DLF">attic window</span> , but I didn't see what they're doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And when they shot and my sisters were there, and they ran in and the two Gestapo men walked out from the <span class="BUILDING">wood shed</span> after the two shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">Then you could hear the screams of my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">But the screams were not human screams. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">They were screams like they would come from <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> or from an unnatural animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="805">Something...not a human scream. </span><span class="sentence" id="806">He started to scream so loud I could hear it in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="807">The first thing he screamed, he said...he started to say Vidui. </span><span class="sentence" id="808">Vidui is a prayer when religious Jews say before death. </span><span class="sentence" id="809">And then he ended with Shema Yisrael. </span><span class="sentence" id="810">He said the Shema so loud that I could...it rings in my...in my ears. </span><span class="sentence" id="811">Then later he started to yell Nekuma, nemt Nekuma. </span><span class="sentence" id="812">It means revenge, revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="813">Take revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="814">And he didn't stop yelling this word revenge and when this...when he started to yell this, the two men, the two Gestapo heard it because they were in the next <span class="DLF">yard</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="815">They came back because they heard him still yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="816">They came back and they shot him five times more and he became quiet. </span><span class="sentence" id="817">During all the time I was 1n this <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , I...I couldn't...I said to hear my father's being shot....I see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">I hear it. </span><span class="sentence" id="819">I don't do anything? </span><span class="sentence" id="820">Why don't you do anying. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">Now what could I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="822">I wanted to say something. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="824">I wanted to move. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="826">I was like a piece of stone. </span><span class="sentence" id="827">After it was quiet I said to my brother, "I'm going down.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="828">And when I came down, so the two Gestapo men and I remember, they were young, tall, blond, handsome, and one's name...I remember his name...because I saw him before. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">His name was Norman. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Norman. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">I'm trying to get now his picture. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">And they were still standing with their revolvers in their hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">And when they saw me and they saw my head was all full of with bandages because this was from the operation, so they thought maybe I was wounded today because there was so much shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="834">And usually somebody was wounded, they finished him off. </span><span class="sentence" id="835">So they came...one came into me, took out his revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="836">And with him was a young Jewish policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="837">So he asked him, "Where was he wounded?" </span><span class="sentence" id="838">He said, "No, he wasn't wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">He just came back from the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="840">He had an operation on his head.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="841">So he put back his revolver, and I went back to see where my father was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="842">And then I saw my mother, with the sister, and those little babies, 3 years old, my nieces, beautiful babies like angels were sitting there and crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="843">They probably didn't know what the crying 1s for, but everybody is crying, they were crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="844">And I could see my mother, my sisters laying over my father and kissing his face and caressing him and he was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="845">One hand was ripped, broken off because when they shot him they hit the hand and the bullets hit the bones and the hand was...you could see the hand laying in the side. : </span><span class="sentence" id="846">And he was laying there and they were crying and kissing him. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">One thing I want to tell you before...before this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">About a week before, this Pasha Rappaport, the new president from the Judenrat came, to the Judenrat and he had a list of about 15 Jews who had long beards and he gave a note that the Jews should cut off their beards, that Farding, the Landkommissar told him that when he brings his friends to visit the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , he's very much embarrassed to see so many Jews with beards. </span><span class="sentence" id="849">So he wants the beards should be cut off. </span><span class="sentence" id="850">And my father was on the list that they had to cut off the beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="851">For my father to cut off the beard was the worse thing because since his beard started to grow, he never touched a hair, even in the first world war in the army, he never touched the beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">So we called a young boy a barber to our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to cut his beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">So he begged him to leave him a little bit here. </span><span class="sentence" id="854">And when he cut it, my father was sitting, he was pale like it was white, and after he finished he got up and in Yiddish he said, "Jetzt hob Ich gefielt dem Ta'am miesse".. It means now I felt the taste of death when he cut this beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="855">And when we looked on my father we didn't recognize him. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">He looked like a strange person because we were always used to seeing him with a full grey beard. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">And here he's shaven. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">It looked like a different person. </span><span class="sentence" id="859">This a week before he was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">After he was shot, the Gestapo came back and they told me with this young Jewish policeman and they said, "We want you should go and gather together all the dead people and bring them to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , to the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> to be buried.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="861">So he took me and we went to somebody who had a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and the men were shot, and you could hear from different <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> screaming, yelling. </span><span class="sentence" id="862">This day they came and they had a list of 20 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="863">Because they said they're going to kill one percent of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="864">There were two thousand Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="865">So they had a list of 20 Jews, the most prominent Jews from before the war to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="866">But the end was they they killed 22. </span><span class="sentence" id="867">I don't know by mistake or just for good measure. </span><span class="sentence" id="868">You know, when you buy something, you add...but they killed 22. </span><span class="sentence" id="869">So we went and we started to get together those dead people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> to take them to the <span class="DLF">Jewish cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="870">I went alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="871">I didn't feel anything in this time even my father was shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="872">But my father always had a reserved place on the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> near his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">Now we are Kohanim. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">I don't know if you know, Kohanim means from the priestly family. </span><span class="sentence" id="875">And this goes over from father to son from father to son, father son. </span><span class="sentence" id="876">Because the Kohanim cannot go on the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , so usually the Kohanim, the priests were buried right by the <span class="DLF">road</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="877">There was a big <span class="DLF">road</span> in the middle of the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="878">On both sides the Kohanim were buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="880">So their children could come closer to their <span class="DLF">graves</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="881">So my father's father which I am named after him was buried there, and my father always had a reserved <span class="NPIP">place</span> to be buried next to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="882">We knew about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="883">So we decided, my brother and I that we would bury my father next to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="884">Even|though] the general said to make one common <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="885">So what we did, when we came a few times to pick up the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="886">So then later we put our father so that his leg should stick out and I told my brother, my brother-in-law that when we will go through with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , they should wait by my grandfather's <span class="DLF">grave</span> and pull him out and we'll make a <span class="DLF">grave</span> near his father, at least this to do for him that he should be buried near his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="887">We came. </span><span class="sentence" id="888">They waited. </span><span class="sentence" id="889">We pulled him out. </span><span class="sentence" id="890">We started to make the common <span class="DLF">grave</span> for everybody, but my father was buried near my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="891">The <span class="DLF">grave</span> for all the people were made next to the common <span class="DLF">grave</span> from the pogrom. </span><span class="sentence" id="892">As I told you, May the 6th, 1919, nine Jews were killed and all the nine were buried in a common <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="893">So we made the <span class="DLF">grave</span> next to them for all the rest of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="894">We didn't make a deep <span class="DLF">grave</span> because it started to be dark so we just made a shallow <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="895">We covered them, and we said we'll come back tomorrow to bury them. </span><span class="sentence" id="896">We came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="897">I came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="898">And my mother started...was sitting and crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="899">She said, "They took away my crown...my crown," because he was the crown of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="900">And we were sitting a whole night, and the next day my brother, my brother-in-law and I and other people went back to make the proper burial. </span><span class="sentence" id="901">Everybody brought in for the parents a tallit. </span><span class="sentence" id="902">It means a prayer shawl. </span><span class="sentence" id="903">We brought in like shrouds. </span><span class="sentence" id="904">Now we didn't prepare shrouds, but every Jew had a kittel, a white coat that he wore three times...twice a year. </span><span class="sentence" id="905">He wore it on Yom Kippur. </span><span class="sentence" id="906">He wore it Passover to the Seder, and he was buried tn it. </span><span class="sentence" id="907">So we brought it for my father to put him in in it. </span><span class="sentence" id="908">Also, we took a sack with wood because the wood where we was shot in the <span class="BUILDING">wood shed</span> was sprinkled, soaked with blood and we believe in the Jewish tradition, we believe that the blood is the soul of the person and we wanted this should be buried, so we took the wood and we put it in the <span class="DLF">grave</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="909">We opened the <span class="DLF">grave</span> and made it deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="910">We put in the kittel. </span><span class="sentence" id="911">We put in the prayer shawl, and we buried him next to my grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="912">We did the same thing with the other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="913">Also there is a tradition that if somebody is killed, when he is buried to put in a 02:27: knife in his right hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="914">The belief is that this is for revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="915">He should revenge his death. </span><span class="sentence" id="916">So we brought knives and we put in everybody's hand a knife. </span><span class="sentence" id="917">We also put in a knife in my father's hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="918">And we buried them, and when we came back I stopped by a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="919">I didn't cry all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="920">And I burst out and crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="921">I couldn't stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="922">And I with a such a loud a voice said, "Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="923">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="924">Why?" </span><span class="sentence" id="925">And for about a half hour I was standing near a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> crying and crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="926">Well, I stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="927">I couldn't cry anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="928">We came <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and we sat down to Shivah, which is 7 days of mourning. </span><span class="sentence" id="929">Now when I sat down, my father he believed in Jahrzeit. </span><span class="sentence" id="930">Jahrzeit means that we on the day of the death we commemorate the dead person, and as we have this commemoration we say Kaddish and other prayers. </span><span class="sentence" id="931">Also we light a candle, a Jahrzeit lamp, a candle in a glass which lasted 24 hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="932">Now in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> you couldn't buy candles for Jahrzeit. </span><span class="sentence" id="933">Here you go in a <span class="BUILDING">supermarket</span> , you can buy as many candles as you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="934">Ina <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , you cannot buy candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="935">My father had Jahrzeit after his father 13 days in the month of Ijar. </span><span class="sentence" id="936">This was in the spring. </span><span class="sentence" id="937">This was in the spring...13 days, and he prepared a whole year pieces of wax, pieces of paraffin, paraffin and he collected it and he wanted to make for his day to commemorate his death, this 24 hour glass with paraffin for his father 13 days in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jjar</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="938">It took him a whole year to collect this paraffin. </span><span class="sentence" id="939">He never did it because he was shot 11 days of the month of Ijar, 2 days earlier. </span><span class="sentence" id="940">So when I came back, he was shot II days[in the month of jar]. </span><span class="sentence" id="941">When I came back from the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , it was 12 days in the month of Ijar. </span><span class="sentence" id="942">I went and I made a wick, I melted the paraffin and I made this Yahrzeit candle for 24 hours, and when I lit it, I lit it for both of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="943">For my father who prepared it for his father, which was a day later. </span><span class="sentence" id="944">And after my father was shot, the whole situation in our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> changed. </span><span class="sentence" id="945">Because even he was not active during the war, he was 60 years old, and the Germans made the list, because he was 60 years old, that means that he was unproductive. </span><span class="sentence" id="946">Because til 60 you were productive. </span><span class="sentence" id="947">You could do something, where[as] by 60 you were not any more productive. </span><span class="sentence" id="948">So you had to be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="949">He was 60 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="950">And the life changed completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="951">Our life, we had to go every day to pray. </span><span class="sentence" id="952">Well, there was no prayers, but in somebody's <span class="INT_SPACE">basement</span> a few people came together to have Minyan, to have 10 people, and we pray for it. </span><span class="sentence" id="953">So this was the first victim of my family that was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="954">Now my brother, who was in the Judenrat in the first Judenrat, he was arrested also. </span><span class="sentence" id="955">And all of them were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="956">My father was let out. </span><span class="sentence" id="957">He wasn't killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="958">Now I don't know if you want to know the reason why he wasn't killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="959">It...1t's not necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="960">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="961">So this he was, my father was the first victim from our family. </span><span class="sentence" id="962">After this killing when they killed the 22 Jews in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , every day, every day something new....and we felt in the <span class="DLF">air</span> that something...the Germans are pushing too much, with too much orders...one order after the other that we couldn't finish the first one, a new order came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="963">Two weeks later, the Judenrat, the whole community...the leaders, were called to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> who was the capitol of the state seat the Germans called it the Gauleihter. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">Gau was like a state. </span><span class="sentence" id="965">And this...we belonged to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="966">They called all the presidents and all the members of the Judenrat to this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and there was a Dr.Ehrhaus. </span><span class="sentence" id="967">He was the Kreishauptmann. </span><span class="sentence" id="968">Kreishauptmann was like head of state. </span><span class="sentence" id="969">And Dr. Ehrhaus was a major in the SS, and he got together all the Jews...their leaders from all the State and he came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="970">He had a paper and he read, "As the Jews are filthy. </span><span class="sentence" id="971">Full of lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="972">And because they are so filthy, there is an epidemic of a typhus in our state. </span><span class="sentence" id="973">I am putting in Polish . </span><span class="sentence" id="974">Kontributsia, means they have to pay so much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="975">And he gave out <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> a million zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="976">This <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> so many...200,000 zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="977"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> 360,000 zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="978">And each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> had to pay so much money. </span><span class="sentence" id="979">He said, "In a week, you bring the money. </span><span class="sentence" id="980">If you will not bring the money, how much money you will be short, so much percent people who will take from your Judenrat, from your council, and we will shoot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="981">If there is 10 percent less, we will shoot 10 percent. </span><span class="sentence" id="982">Twenty percent, we shoot twenty percent." </span><span class="sentence" id="983">Pashek Rappaport who was the Aelteste, who was the president with all the members of the Judenrat came back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and they told this, that they need 360,000 zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="984">Three hundred and sixty thousand zlotys after being in the war and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , people starved because at this time people started to starve. </span><span class="sentence" id="985">And every day we find, did you hear this man starved...this man starved...this. </span><span class="sentence" id="986">Started to starve. </span><span class="sentence" id="987">They didn't have what to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="988">So to get together 360,000 slotas is impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="989">We started to collect. </span><span class="sentence" id="990">The next day they had to go back with the whole member|ship] and everybody from the Judenrat knew that there is a shortage so much, so many will be killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="991">Again, they took them in the same <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and everybody had a burlap sack with money and asked them, "How much you have? </span><span class="sentence" id="992">How much you have?" </span><span class="sentence" id="993">Only our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , only <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> , had the full amount, 360,000 zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="994">All the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> were missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="995">Like for instance, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> needed a million zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="996">They only had 750,000. </span><span class="sentence" id="997">It means 25 percent was missing. </span><span class="sentence" id="998">Right away, he took out 25 percent from their members of the Jewish council, put them in aside. </span><span class="sentence" id="999">The other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1000">And I had a list, exactly <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Barzava</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1001">I remember all the names, and in the book I have every amount and they took out so many people, they took them out in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> , and in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> they took out the machine gun and they shot them...25 percent or how much was this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1002">After they were shot, they got together what was remaining. </span><span class="sentence" id="1003">Ehrenhaus came back again with a new list and he said, "Within a week, you go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1004">Every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">community</span> has to pay taxes from 1914 til today, if some Jew owes taxes.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1005">Now there were Jews who were killed in the first world war fighting for their <span class="REGION">fatherland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1006">There were Jews who left for <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1007">There were Jews who died, didn't leave no nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1008">The community was responsible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1009">Every Jew...the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> 02:36: had to pay up the taxes from 1914. </span><span class="sentence" id="1010">Not only this, every Pole can put in a claim that a Jew owes him money without any documentation that he owes him money and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish community</span> has to pay him within a week. </span><span class="sentence" id="1011">And again what percentage will be missing, so much will be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1012">They come back and this was a terrible thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1013">Here we got 360,000 zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1014">We didn't know how it was collected. </span><span class="sentence" id="1015">People are starving, and here they want we should pay off taxes from 1914 til today for people who don't exist anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">Right away the Director of Internal Revenue was notified. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">He had to dig out books who were laying, covered with dusk and he started to add and to add. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">We figured out, I say we the Jews figured out that we will have a half a million slotas to pay for those things which was impossible to collect. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">But this we figured. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">And the Poles were notified that everybody can claim their debt what the Jews owed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">Imagine if they had a free hand to claim money and the way they loved us, imagine how many claims came in, without documentation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">One episode I remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">There was a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">His name was Fritz. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">Jan Fritz. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">He had a small <span class="BUILDING">store</span> in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and he used to buy by my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">He always used to owe my father money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">I remember when the war broke out he owed us thousand zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1029">He never paid it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1030">He came in and had a claim that my father owed him 5,000 slotas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1031">As I could go out from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and I knew him, I went to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1032">And I said, "Fritz, you owed us money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1033">How could you come in and to say that my father owes you 5,000 zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1034">You know this 1s a lie.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1035">He said, "If you will not go out this minute, I will raise it to 10,000 slotas.‚Äù‚Äô </span><span class="sentence" id="1036">And he could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1037">I didn't say anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1038">I went out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1039">Well, anyway, the claims from the Poles with the taxes came out to a million zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="1040">Now how can you collect from the poor, wretched Jews who are in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , who are already 1n the war 2 years, starving, to get a million slotas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1041">Again, got together and this time they used force. </span><span class="sentence" id="1042">They beat up some people, but anyway, in a week it had to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="1043">In a week they went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1044">Only <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> , only our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , had a million slotas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1045">The rest didn't have. </span><span class="sentence" id="1046">Again the same story. </span><span class="sentence" id="1047">How much it was missing, they were shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1048">We came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1049">After 02:39: they paid, and they were shot, he came out a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , again, with a new list. </span><span class="sentence" id="1050">He said, "This time, within 7 days, every Jew had to leave the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1051">I'm sorry, not 7 days, 3 days. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1052">After 3 days, within 3 days, you have time 3 days, to leave <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1053">And then all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> from all the <span class="REGION">sections</span> had to be relocated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> and to clear out of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1054">Of course, later we find out this was their methods. </span><span class="sentence" id="1055">They wanted to have the Jews in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1056">So when they came back, this was the worst thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1057">The money somehow they sold the last thing, and we sold it to the Polish people for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1058">Like everything what we had, we sold it just to get money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1059">And they got everything for nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1060">But the last order was the worst order. </span><span class="sentence" id="1061">We will leave our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1062">In our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> somehow, everybody had somebody, acquaintances. </span><span class="sentence" id="1063">Some people who could smuggle in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1064">We even had peasants we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1065">Here we'll go to some <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1066">Nobody knows nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1067">How will we survive with the children? </span><span class="sentence" id="1068">And this was the worst thing that would happen til now. </span><span class="sentence" id="1069">We had to leave our <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1070">And we started to leave. </span><span class="sentence" id="1071">The peasants were notified that they should come the next day with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , line up outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1072">Eight in the morning the <span class="DLF">doors</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> were opened. </span><span class="sentence" id="1073">They came in, and everybody could pick up a peasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="1074">They said you can take along anything you want. </span><span class="sentence" id="1075">And they gave us <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1076">The reason why, they wanted we should take along anything...only not <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> , because they wanted to accumulate, to assemble all the things that Jews have in one <span class="NPIP">place</span> , to be easier for them to take it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1077">So the peasants were lined up and we started to load the people the merchandise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1078">Now I went out and I picked out two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> with two horses each, peasants that I knew from my family to load everything what we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1079">Now we decided to go the first day because my brother when he was released from <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , he became friendly with one German policeman. </span><span class="sentence" id="1080">And this German policeman helped him to get out of <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1081">So he asked him, "What should we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="1082">Should we go with the last day or the first day?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1083">He said, "Go with the first day, because it's 1n the hands of the Gestapo, and you never know what they will do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1084">Maybe there will be too many people in the other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1085">They will come and they will kill everybody. </span><span class="sentence" id="1086">So go the first day.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1087">So my family went the first day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1088">We loaded the sacks with everything we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1089">And there was a <span class="DLF">line</span> , and they moved, we went 31 kilometers to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1090">Now nobody could sit on their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1091">Old people, children, everybody had to walk on the right side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1092">Walk the 31 kilometers to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1093">You want me to stop now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1094">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="1095">That's okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1096">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1097">So this how we were chased out from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1098">There was one episode that I have to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1099">There was a man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1100">He actually was from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1101">He was a Jew from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1102">He came back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , and he walked with his wife, with his son, and with his mother-in- law, and father-in-law, after the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1103">But in one moment he made a mistake. </span><span class="sentence" id="1104">Instead to be on the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> , he was on the left side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1105">A German policeman which was from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1106">I remember even his name, Barthelmus, took a rifle and shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1107">He fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1108">His wife and his child, he had a 12 year old child, couldn't even stop for a moment to go and to see what happened with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1109">He was left laying on the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1110">They had to go forward. </span><span class="sentence" id="1111">Now I went to the third day, not the first day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1112">The reason I went the third day because we still had things and merchandise and I wanted to be there two days to give it out during the night to friendly Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1113">Maybe we'll come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1114">Maybe we'll retrieve it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1115">So after the Jews went out with their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> , we went and we took this men on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">hand wagon</span> and we brought him to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and we buried him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1116">And I remembered he wore a grey suit, a grey suit with blue stripes, and he had yellow shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1117">Usually by us, Jews didn't wear this kind of clothing, but he was from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1118">He had modern clothes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1119">So I remember the grey suit with blue, not stripes, blue squares. </span><span class="sentence" id="1120">And we buried him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1121">About a week later or 2 weeks later when we came back, I had to go to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> because they killed somebody and I went to bury them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1122">You see, before my father was killed, I never saw a dead person. </span><span class="sentence" id="1123">The minute my father was killed, I don't know, every time they had to bury somebody, it pulled me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1124">I wanted to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1125">I wanted to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1126">And before I never saw it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1127">So somebody was killed, so I took him to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1128">When I took him to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , the caretaker of the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> , he was an old Polish man, I saw him wearing a grey suit with blue squares with yellow shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1129">So we buried him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1130">I knew that he wouldn't let it go. </span><span class="sentence" id="1131">He uncovered him and he took it out and he wore it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1132">Now we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1133">They brought into Rzeszow Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1134">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> were in this time about 30,000 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1135">They brought into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> maybe other 40,000 Jews from all the little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1136">There was not enough <span class="NPIP">place</span> ...I'm not talking about <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> or to have a <span class="DLF">roof</span> over your head. </span><span class="sentence" id="1137">There was not enough place in the <span class="DLF">alley ways</span> , on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> , for all the Jews to put some <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1138">And they came with those <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagons</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1139">They brought their things, some better, some worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="1140">Every peasant who came to do the service was told that if he brings the Jews to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> , if he has two horses the Jew must pay him 200 zlotys for transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1141">If he has one horse, the Jew must pay him 100 zlotys for the transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1142">In case the Jew doesn't have the money or doesn't give him the money, because sometimes they didn't have, he shouldn't let unload the sacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1143">This was his pay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1144">He can go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> what they put on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and take it for himself because they didn't pay him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1145">So a lot of people didn't have the 200 slotas so they took away right away which didn't make a difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="1146">The Germans took it away later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1147">So I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> the third day, and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> was...sometimes if you talk about tower of Babel how the people couldn't understand [one another]. </span><span class="sentence" id="1148">This was the tower of Babel. </span><span class="sentence" id="1149">People were running around like crazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1150">Children lost their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="1151">Parents lost their 02:47: children. </span><span class="sentence" id="1152">They tried to find themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="1153">Imagine to bring in so many people from different <span class="NPIP">places</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1154">And on the way so many people were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1155">Like this woman lost her husband. </span><span class="sentence" id="1156">And then a woman with children, the husband was killed because he did something wrong. </span><span class="sentence" id="1157">He went on the left side instead of the right <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1158">Everybody was lost. </span><span class="sentence" id="1159">And then to feed those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1160">It was impossible to feed so many people who came in in one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1161">Because they all had to come in within 3 days from all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> around. </span><span class="sentence" id="1162">To have <span class="NPIP">places</span> , I'm not talking sanitary <span class="NPIP">places</span> , but for anything, it was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="1163">It was the worst sight that a person can ever imagine; some horror story, some horror picture, the people were put together. </span><span class="sentence" id="1164">This was it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1165">When they were there, came out an order that the 7th of July and this was a week later, the people from this and this section have to assemble in this and this <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and they will be relocated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1166">Nobody knew that there are <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1167">Nobody knew in this time that there are <span class="BUILDING">crematoriums</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1168">Would the people know that they are <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">death camps</span> , like my family and my sisters, we could run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1169">We had peasants that we knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="1170">I don't know if we would succeed to survive, but at least we would try. </span><span class="sentence" id="1171">Like those Jews I later joined them in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , what they never went with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1172">We didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1173">We figured they would send us in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> to work or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1174">The rumor was they're going to send us to the east to the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> to work in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1175">We didn't know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1176">They assembled...in one day, they assembled 30,000 Jews or 25,000 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1177">This was the first day on the <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> be taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1178">Jews could take only one bundle with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1179">Now everything they told them to take along to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> they were allowed...this was a calculated thing, so if they had to leave in their <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1180">Now, what they did, there was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1181">In every <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , there was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and later made it a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1182">This was a big <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1183">So they took the people from this and this <span class="DLF">streets</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1184">They cleaned them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1185">They left everything <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1186">This way they had a chance to go 1n and to clean out everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1187">The people came to the <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1188">The <span class="DLF">Umschlagplatz</span> was a terrible, a terrible scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="1189">I wasn't there, but later I was told. </span><span class="sentence" id="1190">Before the Jews came in, they had to leave their bundle. </span><span class="sentence" id="1191">Then later they took 2 girls, 3 girls, beautiful girls and they told them to go around and collect all valuables from the people, to collect money, to collect gold, to collect watches, and they did baskets. </span><span class="sentence" id="1192">They brought them over where the Gestapo was standing, where the SS were standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1193">They were SS men, all drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1194">Later, they still didn't believe that Jews gave everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1195">So they went and they pointed out young girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1196">It so happens that they pointed out one of my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="1197">A beautiful girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="1198">Her name was Susza Fein, and they put her and they undressed her and they started to look in every <span class="NPIP">place</span> if she didn't conceal something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1199">She was in this time 19 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1200">And they did it so cruel that they used instruments that they cut open her belly. </span><span class="sentence" id="1201">And they looked that the Jews didn't hide something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1202">The Kolbuszowa Rabbi, an old man of about 75 years was standing and he was blind. </span><span class="sentence" id="1203">So they came to him and they asked him something and he couldn't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1204">So they took out a revolver and they went to shoot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1205">He had two granddaughters. </span><span class="sentence" id="1206">One was 16 and one was 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="1207">Beautiful girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1208">They started to beg this SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="1209">He's our grandfather. </span><span class="sentence" id="1210">He was the Rabbi of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1211">Please don't shoot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1212">He will go with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1213">So they shot him, and they shot the two girls in the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1214">Well, anyway, they took away 6,000 Jews, elderly, crippled, children and they took them away and they had to walk to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> near ??., </span><span class="sentence" id="1215">They had prepared <span class="DLF">ditches</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and those people were killed in those <span class="DLF">ditches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1216">The rest they took to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> and they were transported to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1217">On the way to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad</span> , they were shooting in the columns that a few hundred people remained dead on the <span class="DLF">street</span> laying where they were shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1218">They put in the people in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1219">In the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> before they put in the people, they put on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> untreated lime. </span><span class="sentence" id="1220">I don't know...lime if it is not treated and if it's mixed with water, it starts to boil and it start to give out gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="1221">So those were untreated lime, because they knew that soon the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> will be wet and then the gases will come out and then people will choke. </span><span class="sentence" id="1222">Instead to take from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> would take 3 hours, it took them 3 days. </span><span class="sentence" id="1223">When the people came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> , they opened the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">railroad cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1224">More than 50 percent were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1225">And then they had to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="1226">We find this out later. </span><span class="sentence" id="1227">We, at this time we didn't know...we...well, I jumped a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="1228">I...I will tell you
QUESTION:  I need you to stick to what you saw.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1229">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1230">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="1231">Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1232">So when we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> ...when I came the third day, and when I saw those things what's going on there with the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1233">So Farding gave out an order that he needs...you see, our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...there were four <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> belonged to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> ...our <span class="REGION">county</span> ...that he needs hundred young boys for each <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to go back, and he will make a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1234">The reason...we should destroy, taking apart the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1235">To <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sokolov</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glogov</span> , ?? , </span><span class="sentence" id="1236">and ?? . </span><span class="sentence" id="1237">I volunteered with my brother to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1238">The reason I volunteered because I thought I will be back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1239">I have peasants that I know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1240">I will be able to buy food somehow to send it to our family to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> , because in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> they would starve. </span><span class="sentence" id="1241">But without sending them somehow, we would. </span><span class="sentence" id="1242">So we went back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1243">We walked a whole night back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1244">In the morning we were taken into the <span class="BUILDING">Shul</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">temple</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">Houses of Study</span> , and this became our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and this became our new life to be in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1245">Meanwhile the people were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> , and they were made four transports

QUESTION:  Okay.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1294">ANSWER:  We worked in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1295">And we had [it] quite good. </span><span class="sentence" id="1296">The reason why? </span><span class="sentence" id="1297">We didn't have no German guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1298">All the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> around us were Judenrein. </span><span class="sentence" id="1299">There were no Jews around anymore because all the Jews were taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1300">We had in our <span class="REGION">section</span> , we had a few <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> , which the German organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="1301">One was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Breshatka</span> , and one was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hutta Komarovska</span> , and one was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mielec</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1302"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mielec</span> was quite known, because this was the second place that they tattooed people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1303">They didn't give numbers, but they had on their head a KL. </span><span class="sentence" id="1304">KL it means Konzentrations Lager. </span><span class="sentence" id="1305">Now if some people had the KL, I know they were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mielec</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1306">And this was very close to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1307">And we didn't have no guards. </span><span class="sentence" id="1308">It means that we were on our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="1309">But Farding got us together, and he said, "If one of us will escape, 10 of us...10 will be hanged.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1310">He made us responsible for everybody, to make sure nobody will escape. </span><span class="sentence" id="1311">And every day we went to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1312">Then later, suddenly, I became friendly with Farding, and it was very...there was one <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sokolow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1313"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sokolow</span> belonged to us....to our <span class="REGION">county</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1314">The night of the expulsion of the Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sokolow</span> , when they told them to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow ghetto</span> , Farding came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sokolow</span> drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1315">And he said he wants Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1316">So they started to bring him old Jews, because they figured the old Jews will not survive the trips or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1317">He wanted and so they brought them...and he started to kill them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1318">And he killed 1n this night...he killed 49 Jews by himself with his own hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1319">He was drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1320">He had a bottle of vodka. </span><span class="sentence" id="1321">He drank Vodka, and he killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1322">They brought him Jews and he killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="1323">There was a pile of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="1324">But he was such a sadist, and he knew everything about Jewish religion because they...like I told you before he spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="1325">He said, "He's going to kill the Jews to make them kosher. </span><span class="sentence" id="1326">They should go straight to <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> because they will be kosher.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">And he told them he's going to do with the Jews the same thing as Jews did with chickens before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">If a chicken had to be made kosher, and if it had to be soaked 1n water, then later put in salt on all <span class="NPIP">sides</span> , and then later this had to be done in the night with candles, two candles...had to be held near the chicken to see if everything is correct. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">So he got the two Jews holding candles. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">He had there a bag of salt. </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">And every time he shot a Jew, he took salt and he put it on the wound and he said, "You see, now I make it kosher, and now the Jew go straight to <span class="NPIP">Heaven</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">Those were the things to add to all that terrible things they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">They played with us, like a cat plays with a mouse before...before it [kills]... So this Farding suddenly became friendly with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">Now the reason why he became friendly with me...I knew why. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">Because he liked to have somebody who should confident...who should get confident and later to find out all kind of stories that he wants to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">Like he had there a young boy and I write about him a lot...a boy from 16 years, and he promoted him in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow ghetto</span> to be the assistant commandant of the Police. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">A 16 year old boy...his name was Isaac Silber. </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">He was from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">And if you speak to a Rzeszow Jew about Issac Silber, you will know a lot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">Issac Silber was from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">He was born by my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">And before the war, his mother...he didn't have a father...his mother used to be the one...she wished to work in the <span class="INT_SPACE">public baths</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">Very low people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">And this Isaac Silber was very smart, and he started to be a friend with Farding. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">Farding kept him, and he found out from him everything he wanted, and for this reason when the Jews were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> , he promoted him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">And he make him the assistant commandant in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">A young boy from 16 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">So he became the famous Isaac Silber. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">We used to call him Itschele. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">Itschele was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">So he became friendly ... Probably he thought that becoming friendly with me, maybe he would get a second Itschele or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">Now the reason how I got together with him is when we came back, he found a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> with hundreds of crates with all kind of merchandise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">And on the crates was written Isaac Salsitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">I don't know if you remember, when my father...1n the beginning of the war, somebody squealed, and the Germans came and took away all the merchandise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">It took them three days to take out everything we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">This was never used. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">They put in a <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> , and it was laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">Now Farding finds out...they found it, so he needed somebody who knew about this merchandise. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">So he came to our commandant of our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> which was a Jewish man from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">His name was Henry Mundt, and he said, Mundt I need somebody to clear out this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">So he said what you need better. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">I have here a son from Isaac Salsitz. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">Who knows better? </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">So he went...took me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">He sent me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with him, and I come in and I see our merchandise was laying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">And what he wanted...I should make packages...to unpack everything, and make packages from soap, from coffee, from chocolate, from tea, from cocao. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">All those things what they don't have in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , I made packages and I send it away. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">I made ready to send it to his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">So I worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">And while I was working there every day in the morning they took me in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">I worked there, and then in the afternoon, they let me out for lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">They let me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">They searched me if I don't steal anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">Steal my own stuff. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">And they let me back for lunch. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">And this I went every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">The other boys worked to demolishing the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> or regulating the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , and I worked there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">He used to come in every time, and he used to discuss with me things. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">And his biggest pleasure was to speak to me about girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">And somehow he told me stories that since he was a young boy he was with girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">And he wanted to hear stories from me, and I had invent stories to tell him what womanizer I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">I didn't know her, but I had to tell him because he loved it. </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">He even taught me all kind of expressions. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">He said do you remember Martin Luther famous saying, not the Martin Luther King, but Martin Luther, so his famous saying was (in German) . </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">It means twice a week it wouldn't hurt him, it wouldn't her, and it makes in a year 102, what 1s right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">This was his famous saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">And then every time he talked different things and he asked me... One time he came in and he said to me, "Do you know what happened to your family?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">We knew already in this time that our family is dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">So I said, "No, I would like to know.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">He said, "Yes, I saw your family last week in the <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">They were already dead 3, 4 months. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">He said, "If you want, I can take you...if I have my few days off, I go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> with my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">I will take you along and I will take you to your family where they work in a

know....he played around like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">One day we came out, 12 o'clock from this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">I had a other man working with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">And we stopped in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where they used to distribute milk for free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">There was a <span class="BUILDING">milk factory</span> , but they got the skim milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">They brought it over there, and the Poles used

group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1929">So I said I will come to him and maybe I can convince him to take us in. </span><span class="sentence" id="1930">Not only that we will be able to fight the Germans, but we will be safe from them that they shouldn't kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1931">I sent over a girl who belonged to the organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="1932">This is the woman whom I brought over last year. </span><span class="sentence" id="1933">And we made an appointment, and he wanted to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1934">He prepared there a <span class="NPIP">place</span> , a <span class="BUILDING">meeting place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1935">We came to the <span class="BUILDING">meeting place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1936">This 1s complicated, how and what, when. </span><span class="sentence" id="1937">But, anyway, I came there with my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1938">And he was very happy to see me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1939">The <span class="BUILDING">meeting place</span> was made in a <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> between the section of cows and the section of horses and there where the animals ate the hay, this was removable. </span><span class="sentence" id="1940">We could go in that nobody could see. </span><span class="sentence" id="1941">They cut the locks and this was a small <span class="NPIP">place</span> about, I would say about 8 by 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="1942">And then we came in, and they were very happy to see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="1943">He grabbed me and kissed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1944">He said we will kill Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1945">We'll survive the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="1946">And the next day he went to...so he said right away...we were infested with lice. </span><span class="sentence" id="1947">In the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , we didn't have no changes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1948">So he said, "Take off those rags.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1949">And he brought me fresh underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1950">I put on the fresh underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1951">My brother put on the fresh underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="1952">And then they brought us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="1953">Then we made plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1954">And then his...he had an older brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1955">The older brother was Yashik was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="1956">It was a little complicated. </span><span class="sentence" id="1957">Stashik and Yashik. </span><span class="sentence" id="1958">There were two brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1959">And his brothers also was in the underground, so he came in and he said to me, "You know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1960">There is somebody who wants to sell a revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="1961">You want to buy it?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1962">I said, "Sure, Fred.‚Äù‚Äô </span><span class="sentence" id="1963">Because I was ready to buy. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1964">Go and buy it.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1965">And he went and he came back about an hour later, and he said, "He doesn't want money. </span><span class="sentence" id="1966">He wants to have a suit or two suits.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1967">I said, "No problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="1968">I have two suits still left by somebody in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1969">I will send for it, and I will give him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1970">Bring me the revolver.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1971">He went. </span><span class="sentence" id="1972">He came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1973">He said, "Oh, he's not <span class="BUILDING">home</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1974">And when he came in, I saw him holding the hand in his right pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1975">And I had there a knapsack that I brought, and I had there shoes, not boots, shoes and short, half shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="1976">And I didn't need in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1977">I said to him, "You know what? </span><span class="sentence" id="1978">I have those shoes," and I dragged them, "I don't need. </span><span class="sentence" id="1979">It's the same size as you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1980">Why don't you take the shoes?" </span><span class="sentence" id="1981">So he went and he opened the knapsack with the left hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1982">And his hand was filled in the pack...I didn't suspect him, but some intuition....I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1983">Then I asked him...he used to be contributor to the Polish underground newspaper and every Tuesday the newspaper came out, and this was a Tuesday. </span><span class="sentence" id="1984">I asked him, "Tell me, Yasha, today the newspaper came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1985">What is there news.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1986">Because from the underground newspaper, we could find out more than from the German newspaper. "</span><span class="sentence" id="1987">What is the news.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1988">He said, "I forgot.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="1989">To me, it was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1990">He 1s a contributor and I ask him about the news, but he says I forgot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1991">He opens the knapsack with the left hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1992">He doesn't take...so intuition, and I was in this time already in a bundle of straw with my brother covered with a military blanket because we want to rest. </span><span class="sentence" id="1993">Something told me and I lifted up the blanket and I took out my revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="1994">I always had my revolver with me even if I slept. </span><span class="sentence" id="1995">I had a belt, and on the belt I had a revolver, a hatchet, hand grenades, a flashlight, the whole arsenal I had around me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1996">So I took out the revolver, and I lifted the blanket and I had a long barrel revolver, and I lifted it he shouldn't see that I'm holding and I cocked the revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="1997">I held it straight to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1998">In this moment and he was still standing in front of me holding his hand in the package, in this moment, my brother didn't know what I'm doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1999">He wanted to go down. </span><span class="sentence" id="2000">He opened the blanket. </span><span class="sentence" id="2001">And he saw and he left me exposed with my revolver pointed to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2002">The minute he saw it he walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="2003">Then I said to my brother, "What did you do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2004">And he couldn't...he said to me, "Why didn't you trust them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2005">Those are people want to save us.‚Äù "</span><span class="sentence" id="2006">Well, it was done. </span><span class="sentence" id="2007">It's too late.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2008">About 10 minutes after he left, we heard knocks on the <span class="DLF">wall</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2009">Later, we find out, those knocks were a signal for him to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2010">Because this was near the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and on the <span class="DLF">road</span> was a German patrol. </span><span class="sentence" id="2011">So they had to let them and this later we found out, to let them know that the German patrol was far away that he could start to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2012">But we didn't know about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2013">But when he saw me ready, he walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="2014">The next day we didn't know what to do, how to face them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2015">We were embarrassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2016">But they didn't mention anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="2017">I didn't mention anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="2018">They went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2019">He brought me medicine. </span><span class="sentence" id="2020">He brought me this. </span><span class="sentence" id="2021">About 5 o'clock, they came in and he brought a German newspaper and he wanted I should translate him about the front, where the front is. </span><span class="sentence" id="2022">We looked, we had a little kerosene lamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="2023">My brother started to eat, and I looked in the paper and he said to me, "Well, I lost something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2024">Why don't you lend me your flashlight.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2025">I took off the flashlight, and I gave it to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2026">Soon as I gave him the flashlight 1t became dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="2027">He turned off the kerosene lamp. </span><span class="sentence" id="2028">And as it became dark, I hear a shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="2029">One, two, three, four. </span><span class="sentence" id="2030">I didn't know what, when. </span><span class="sentence" id="2031">And I fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="2032">I fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="2033">I was [old you see??], </span><span class="sentence" id="2034">and my head started to spin around. </span><span class="sentence" id="2035">In this moment...you see, I am telling you this...this takes a few seconds, a few minutes maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="2036">But this took a split of a second and I fell. </span><span class="sentence" id="2037">And I fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="2038">I said, "This is it.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2039">They took us in to be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2040">But I'm glad that somebody shot me from behind because I was always afraid to be caught by the Germans alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="2041">I didn't want they should torture me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2042">So we always had a rule in our unit that if the last bullet we cannot shoot, the last bullet we had to leave for ourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="2043">But here, I fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="2044">I said, "Fine, this is it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2045">We went through so much. </span><span class="sentence" id="2046">The whole family doesn't live. </span><span class="sentence" id="2047">Everybody I loved doesn't live. </span><span class="sentence" id="2048">It's enough.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2049">And while I was laying there, I was thinking...but I'm still alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="2050">Why should he shoot me? </span><span class="sentence" id="2051">Why shouldn't I kill him? </span><span class="sentence" id="2052">Laying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , somehow I took out my revolver, and it was dark, and I wanted to put in my index finger to pull the trigger, it was like a piece of wood. </span><span class="sentence" id="2053">I got a bullet, he shot me, I got three bullets in my neck and went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="2054">I...then when I caught myself I got a bullet here, and the bullet traveled through the finger, ripped the finger apart, but didn't touch the bone. </span><span class="sentence" id="2055">So when I wanted to put in this finger, I couldn't because it didn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="2056">Now [1.e. </span><span class="sentence" id="2057">today] in winter, I cannot move this finger. </span><span class="sentence" id="2058">In winter, it gets stiff. </span><span class="sentence" id="2059">But during the day ??.. </span><span class="sentence" id="2060">Right away, I had enough. </span><span class="sentence" id="2061">I put in the other finger. </span><span class="sentence" id="2062">I put in this finger. </span><span class="sentence" id="2063">And it was dark. </span><span class="sentence" id="2064">I shot once in the <span class="DLF">air</span> , and I had a big caliber. </span><span class="sentence" id="2065">So from the shot, I could see from the glare of it, and I could see this brother standing in the <span class="DLF">doorway</span> because it was very small where they made the extension the <span class="DLF">door</span> to go in. </span><span class="sentence" id="2066">So I still saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2067">It went so fast that I still saw him standing pointing at his revolver to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2068">It went so fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="2069">So when I shot once, I saw him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2070">Right away, I shot him the third to him and right the third time. </span><span class="sentence" id="2071">By the third time because I didn't know that I will hit him with the first bullet. </span><span class="sentence" id="2072">When I shot him the first time I saw him already laying stretched out. </span><span class="sentence" id="2073">With my second bullet, one I shot in the <span class="DLF">air</span> , with the second bullet, I pierced his heart and I killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2074">And by the third bullet, I saw him stretched out. </span><span class="sentence" id="2075">When his brother saw what happened because he saw by the glare the same thing as I and his brother start to shot to my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="2076">When he saw what happened he ran out. </span><span class="sentence" id="2077">And this was an <span class="DLF">emergency door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2078">When he run out I shot after him, and I hit him in the spine, and he fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="2079">Now we are naked. </span><span class="sentence" id="2080">My brother didn't know what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="2081">So he started to yell to them, "What you playing with firecrackers? </span><span class="sentence" id="2082">Because he couldn't understand, it went so fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="2083">So I said to him, "No.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2084">And we had our things on the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , and there was no <span class="DLF">ladder</span> to the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2085">But we had to climb through the beams. </span><span class="sentence" id="2086">Took the revolver in my teeth, I started to climb and I wanted to take boots. </span><span class="sentence" id="2087">I wanted to take the medicine, and also the most important thing I wanted to take, I had a diary what my sister started the first day of the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="2088">And every day she wrote in the diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="2089">But because we came to him, I figured I will be able to sit and I will enter for a few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="2090">So I wanted to get the diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="2091">But in the dark, scared, you [are] hit, I don't know where I'm hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="2092">So when I took one boot out of the 2? </span><span class="sentence" id="2093">I took this and that. </span><span class="sentence" id="2094">I left everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="2095">I jumped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="2096">I called my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="2097">He wasn't there anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="2098">What happened? </span><span class="sentence" id="2099">He find a <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2100">He ran out the <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2101">And his friends, there 03:46: were about 6 friends waiting <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2102">They grabbed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2103">When I came in, I remember I stepped on this dead body. </span><span class="sentence" id="2104">It was so soft. </span><span class="sentence" id="2105">So I came in...in the <span class="DLF">openings</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2106">I saw a few guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="2107">And I knew the guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="2108">They were my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="2109">They're holding my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="2110">And a few, standing...laying over this other brother was wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="2111">So I was standing in the <span class="DLF">doorway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2112">I still had three bullets in my revolver, and I said to them, "If you don't let him go this minute, three of you will be killed.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2113">I said, "I never miss. </span><span class="sentence" id="2114">I have three bullets left in the revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="2115">Three will be killed.‚Äô </span><span class="sentence" id="2116">And the minute I said it they let him go and they run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="2117">I remember I even still had enough brain, I went back and I took out from the hand of this dead guy his revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="2118">And I said to my brother let's run we ran, it was the 18th of January. </span><span class="sentence" id="2119">Two yards high snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="2120">All we had is our underwear. </span><span class="sentence" id="2121">No shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2122">Nothing! </span><span class="sentence" id="2123">And we run and we didn't know where. </span><span class="sentence" id="2124">We had to run up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2125">We had to cross a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2126">And in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and this was about 6 o'clock in the afternoon. </span><span class="sentence" id="2127">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> when one dog starts to bark, all dogs bark, so you could hear not one, the whole <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> barking. </span><span class="sentence" id="2128">And you could [see] lights and naturally, we are running. </span><span class="sentence" id="2129">We don't know where we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="2130">We're going up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2131">The snow was so frozen. </span><span class="sentence" id="2132">From the moon you could see millions of diamonds in the snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="2133">Everything was so sparkling. </span><span class="sentence" id="2134">We run. </span><span class="sentence" id="2135">We didn't stop. </span><span class="sentence" id="2136">And we run, I would say about a kilometer to the first <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2137">We stopped at a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2138">I look at my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="2139">My brother looks at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2140">And here it was, blood running from my neck, and the blood was, we didn't know what happened because the blood from the cold, it got thick and it became clustered, but it still was running. </span><span class="sentence" id="2141">The hand was swollen. </span><span class="sentence" id="2142">We could see a <span class="DLF">trail</span> in the snow from our walking from drops of bloods. </span><span class="sentence" id="2143">I said, "Well, if somebody will come, they will come and they will catch us.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2144">Well, and if it's a snowy terrain in the winter, you don't know where you are, because everything looks the same. </span><span class="sentence" id="2145">I said, "Where are we?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2146">We don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2147">This was 6 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="2148">But one thing, I knew that every 6 o'clock a autobus a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszova</span> at 6 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="2149">I said, "If we would be lucky, and if we would see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> coming I will know the direction where to go.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2150">And as I said it, we saw from a distance two reflectors from the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2151">It's not like here you have thousands of <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2152">There was only one <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bus</span> that came only once a day. </span><span class="sentence" id="2153">And so, more or less I figured out that I will go this way and there was a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> that I knew this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , and this peasant was friendly. </span><span class="sentence" id="2154">I said, "If we would be lucky, and if I would hit this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , we would be saved.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2155">Now imagine if peasants will see us in the middle of the winter, two people naked without shoes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2156">Well, anyway, we started to go down, so I had my two revolvers. </span><span class="sentence" id="2157">I had everything on me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2158">I said to my brother, "If something will happen, you should know I will open the hand grenade and we're killing each other.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2159">He had his revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="2160">And we went down and it so happens that I hit the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I wanted to hit. </span><span class="sentence" id="2161">Exactly 1t was, this was a Sure thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2162">We run up here, and this <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2163">So I had to go like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="2164">I hit it exactly and I knew the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2165">And from there I knew exactly how to go back to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2166">It took me a whole night. </span><span class="sentence" id="2167">I reached our friends about 5 in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="2168">Now on the way, we stopped...but this is not for now...I was wounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="2169">I didn't know what. </span><span class="sentence" id="2170">I went to a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="2171">The doctor, you see, the doctor I went to [was from] a different section because I didn't...and I had to go right away he shouldn't find out that something happened to those two guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="2172">I went to him and he checked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2173">He said, "Here the bullets went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="2174">It was a small caliber. </span><span class="sentence" id="2175">By here the bullets went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="2176">He gave me an injection against blood poison. </span><span class="sentence" id="2177">I came back to our group. </span><span class="sentence" id="2178">The Germans heard the shots. </span><span class="sentence" id="2179">And this was the patrol. </span><span class="sentence" id="2180">When the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">patrol</span> came, they shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2181">So they told them a story that bandits came. </span><span class="sentence" id="2182">They wanted money, and they didn't give them the money, so they shot them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2183">And they took it for an answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="2184">The next day they made a report to the police. </span><span class="sentence" id="2185">When the police came to investigate. </span><span class="sentence" id="2186">And the police didn't take this answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="2187">They started to search. </span><span class="sentence" id="2188">And they find this little <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> , and they find the <span class="DLF">wall</span> covered with blood when I tried to climb. </span><span class="sentence" id="2189">And they went upstairs and they found then my boots, they find there the...the case with the medicines, with 03:51: the instruments. </span><span class="sentence" id="2190">And they find my sister's diary. </span><span class="sentence" id="2191">And they knew it is not bandits. </span><span class="sentence" id="2192">And they took out the second boy, and they shot him right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2193">So the second boy was also shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2194">The Germans finished him off. </span><span class="sentence" id="2195">This was an episode. </span><span class="sentence" id="2196">Now this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="2197">Then later it was very well known. </span><span class="sentence" id="2198">Then later they caught me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2199">They gave me poison. </span><span class="sentence" id="2200">This is a long story. </span><span class="sentence" id="2201">But this episode, I couldn't show my face. </span><span class="sentence" id="2202">Everybody knew about it, they gave a price on my head in the underground paper. </span><span class="sentence" id="2203">So once I went to a peasant to a different <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2204">And he knew that I'm Jewish because the other Jew took me over to buy something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2205">So he said in the papers it was that they will pay 100,000 zlotys for my head. </span><span class="sentence" id="2206">So he said to me, "Listen, there is that boy here.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2207">He said the name Salsitz. "</span><span class="sentence" id="2208">I would like to help him because I knew his father. </span><span class="sentence" id="2209">Maybe you know where he is. </span><span class="sentence" id="2210">Tell him to come to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2211">I will give him bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="2212">I will give him butter. </span><span class="sentence" id="2213">I would like to help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2214">I want to save this boy.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2215">And I knew the reason why he tells me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2216">So I said, "Listen, if I would know where he is, I could get the 100,000 zlotys. </span><span class="sentence" id="2217">Why should I tell you? </span><span class="sentence" id="2218">I want to know myself.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2219">He asked me about me because he wanted to make and to get this money. </span><span class="sentence" id="2220">So this went on for a few weeks til I joined the Ak. Well I saw I couldn't, so I joined the AK in a different <span class="NPIP">section</span> , and I had papers and they accepted me when everything was healed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2221">QUESTION:  Slow down. </span><span class="sentence" id="2222">What kind of papers? </span><span class="sentence" id="2223">How did you get papers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2224">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2225">Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="2226">Before I left this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2227">The first day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, no, the second day of Rosh Hashanah. </span><span class="sentence" id="2228">The Jews in 1942, they killed in our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and(?) </span><span class="sentence" id="2229">Novasans they got together people from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> who wanted to run away to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2230">There was a place,<span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bokhnia</span> , that they made false papers for Jews and Poles, and they went to <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> , and <span class="COUNTRY">Hungary</span> was easier to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="2231">And they caught those people, they didn't catch those people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2232">They caught this girl who was their runner, and but once I'm telling you this, I want to tell you about this girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="2233">I think she should be remembered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2234">QUESTION:  We may not have much time, so if you can condense it a little.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2235">ANSWER:  See, this girl was the runner, and she was caught on the list of 45 people with false papers, that they should run away to <span class="COUNTRY">Romania</span> , and she was caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="2236">And she was tortured. </span><span class="sentence" id="2237">She was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2238">The Germans knew those people because they had the documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="2239">And they arrested those people, and they brought them to us in <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> when we were in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2240">During the night I find out about it, and I went to the <span class="BUILDING">jail</span> , and through a <span class="DLF">window</span> , they told me those things what happened to them, that this girl was caught. </span><span class="sentence" id="2241">But there 1s a other list of 200 that she had to prepare documents. </span><span class="sentence" id="2242">They didn't know if they got the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="2243">But if they got the list, they will pick up the 200 too. </span><span class="sentence" id="2244">What was necessary is to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> which was 31 kilometers and go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> and to warn the people that they are arrested and they should do something and to hide. </span><span class="sentence" id="2245">So soon as they told me, I told...I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with the horse what Farding gave me to bring the old junk to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> and I always had it ready packed because I never knew when I will have to go in a hurry. </span><span class="sentence" id="2246">This was at night, and I took the horse and I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> , 31 kilometers, because even if the Germans would catch me, I had a pass to go and I went officially because I had to bring those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2247">So I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> and I came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> with these things, and I had to notify someone I know to notify that they were arrested. </span><span class="sentence" id="2248">And they are worrying about the 200 other people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2249">And they told me who to contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="2250">I contact this person, and he notified the 200 people they should go into hiding who were on the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="2251">But what the Germans did, they came and they couldn't find nobody from the 200, so they took 200 other Jews, and they brought them to us with them and in this day, the second day of Rosh Hashanah, they killed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Novasans</span> (??). </span><span class="sentence" id="2252">this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> not far from us, they killed 400 Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="2253">They brought Jews from <span class="BUILDING">Hutta Kaminski</span> (??), </span><span class="sentence" id="2254">from ?? . </span><span class="sentence" id="2255">Young girls, beautiful girls, Jews who had scabs, cuts, and they reported they cannot go to work, so they took them and they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2256">Now there are so many details, but it is not for now. </span><span class="sentence" id="2257">But you ask me about the other details.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2258">QUESTION:  The papers
ANSWER:  So when they killed the 400 people, I became very hysterical and I went into a Polish woman, was very friendly with my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="2259">This was the woman I gave all the merchandise when I was left, when they took away our people to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> , so I gave her the merchandise over the <span class="DLF">fence</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2260">So I went to her and started to cry very hysterical. </span><span class="sentence" id="2261">I said, "I want to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="2262">I want to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="2263">Do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2264">Do something.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2265">She said, "What can I do.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2266">She said, "What can I do?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2267">I said, "I need papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="2268">I want to run away.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2269">She said, "I can help you out with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2270">lama very good friend of the Monseigneur, from the <span class="BUILDING">Catholic Church</span> ...in Polish Dekan (dean). </span><span class="sentence" id="2271">I will ask him if he can give you papers.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2272">So I told her, "You know, I had a friend who went with me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2273">His name was ?.. </span><span class="sentence" id="2274">He looked a little like me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2275">And he went me to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2276">And he was killed in 1939. </span><span class="sentence" id="2277">He was in the Polish army. </span><span class="sentence" id="2278">He was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2279">Maybe he can give me his paper, and then if there would be a picture we look very much alike.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2280">She went to the Monseigneur, and the Monseigneur gave me a birth certificate which I have with me, which they made a copy of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2281">And he gave me this birth certificate. </span><span class="sentence" id="2282">With this birth certificate, I could show that that I was ?.. </span><span class="sentence" id="2283">So through this girl, she was a runner between two groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="2284">So she went to the group which was farther away from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and she made a contact and with her I went and I was accepted and she introduced me to their commandant, she was very friendly with and he liked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2285">He took me in, and so then I became a member of this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="2286">And this was a very important group because this group was not like from people who belonged to the underground, and they were staying in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2287">This was a group who was a combat group in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2288">And I was very happy to be with them because with them, we destroyed <span class="BUILDING">police stations</span> , we blew up <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2289">We did so many things because they were a force. </span><span class="sentence" id="2290">You see when I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> as a Jew, I only could go out when there was a blizzard, when there was a rain. </span><span class="sentence" id="2291">I was a fugitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="2292">Everybody would give me out. </span><span class="sentence" id="2293">I have to hide the gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="2294">But when I was with them, I was a hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="2295">I came out to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> with the rifle open. </span><span class="sentence" id="2296">I put in a beret with a Polish eagle. </span><span class="sentence" id="2297">I put on a band with a white and red as a Polish patriot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2298">The girls even waited for us, to kiss us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2299">The people used to bring us vodka and food. </span><span class="sentence" id="2300">I was the same man, fighting the same enemy. </span><span class="sentence" id="2301">But here because I was a Jew, I was fugitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="2302">And here because I was Pole, I was a hero. </span><span class="sentence" id="2303">So with them, it gave me the opportunity to take, and every night there was some action because they were so strong and they could do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2304">And with them I had the opportunity to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2305">03:59
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2306">We're going to have to change tapes and make a decision.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2307">ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2308">But this way if you can make a decision that is a few from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , I would like to tell you a few episodes how we made...uh...a
QUESTION:  Let me ask you a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="2309">End of Tape #3 Tape #4
QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2310">The tape is started. </span><span class="sentence" id="2311">You wanted to take us back.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2312">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="2313">I want to go back when we were quite strong yet in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> with our Jewish group. </span><span class="sentence" id="2314">Now, our leader was a Jew who was forester, which is very unusual for a Jew to be this profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="2315">Was a very intelligent man, but mostly he was a forester because he specialized in artificial raising [of] fish. </span><span class="sentence" id="2316">He had artificial <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lakes</span> ...not artificial...had man made <span class="ENV_FEATURES">lakes</span> , and they raised carps, and this belonged to a very rich Jew in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> and his name was Bank, and the forester's name was Pinya. </span><span class="sentence" id="2317">Well, anyway, and Froelich, Pinya Froelich, and he was the organizer of this group who was there before I came and he still was our leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="2318">Then later he was killed, and also it was a very unfortunate thing how he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2319">Uh...He could be saved, but...uh... because the men who surrounded the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> were peasants from his <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and he didn't to use his gun, he didn't want to shoot, because they were his friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="2320">They were people who he knew all his life, so he didn't want to harm them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2321">But nevertheless, they took him with his wife, and they took him to a <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> and they killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2322">After this I became, I took over his <span class="NPIP">place</span> , and I became the leader. </span><span class="sentence" id="2323">Now, we wanted to do something against the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="2324">It was very hard for us because our main thing was to protect ourselves from the Poles who were so hostile towards us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2325">There was, as I told you before, the Poles used to get skim milk for free, but there was a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> not far from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> when in, a <span class="BUILDING">milk factory</span> , and all the peasants used to bring their milk and there they produced cheese, butter, and this was sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2326">And from the whole section, all the Poles used to bring their milk there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2327">So we thought that we want to disrupt these things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2328">I had there a man that I knew, and he was working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2329">And he gave me all the information when the work starts, stops, who is the guard, and how. </span><span class="sentence" id="2330">So one dark night six of us went over there and we disarmed the guard, and we went in and we destroyed the whole <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2331">It took us about an hour. </span><span class="sentence" id="2332">We broke all the equipment, and there was special equipment brought from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , and all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">machines</span> where they used to produce the cheese and the butter, and everything was destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2333">After everything was destroyed we packed our knapsacks full of cheese, that we had it enough for about 2, 3 months and we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="2334">The next day the Germans came and they surrounded the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and they arrested some Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="2335">They accused them that they did some sabotage, but then later they let them out because they had proof that some partisans, they didn't know that we did it, but some partisans came and they did the damage. </span><span class="sentence" id="2336">And it was quite a big damage. </span><span class="sentence" id="2337">It was a big help for the peasants, because for months they didn't have to give the milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="2338">They didn't know what to do with the milk because there was not a facility to manufacture the cheese and the butter. </span><span class="sentence" id="2339">But then later, they rebuilt 1t and it by them 3 months and they started again. </span><span class="sentence" id="2340">But this was a very big satisfaction what we did. </span><span class="sentence" id="2341">Also, once a week they collected the cows from the peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="2342">Each calf when it was born, they put in a ear ring on the calf, and this was registered. </span><span class="sentence" id="2343">And eventually they had to give over the cow to the Germans and they also had an evidence how much milk the peasant has to bring in from the cow. </span><span class="sentence" id="2344">They delivered the cows, once a week they were driven or they were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> so we always waited when they were taken to the <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> they chased...not by <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> , but on foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2345">So we waited on the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> and we lured always one or two or three cows into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and we took them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="2346">So this was a very big help for us because 1n the winter, usually, we sold some cows and then we we killed one so we had meat enough for weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="2347">So this was also a way of trying to do some damage. </span><span class="sentence" id="2348">And, there was an other case that we were in a <span class="NPIP">place</span> that there was a search for Poles, but not for Jews anymore, but the search for Poles for taking the Poles to <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2349">And we were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and we were hidden in the hay, and they searched even the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> , but they didn't find us, and they left the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> and they took the owner from this <span class="NPIP">place</span> that we were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="2350">He didn't know we were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2351">And then he escaped, so in the evening a Polish policeman came to take him back. </span><span class="sentence" id="2352">And we saw it, so we waited for him <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , and we killed him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2353">We took away his gun, his rifle, his <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2354">So those were things that we tried to do as much as possible. </span><span class="sentence" id="2355">But when I joined the AK, then it was a different story because the Ak was openly more loyal, in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> they were open and they could do a lot of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2356">They were very strong. </span><span class="sentence" id="2357">They received drops from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">planes</span> , ammunition, money, medicine, and guns, everything, from <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2358">They used to drop in special assigned places in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and they had all those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2359">So we did other things like there was a <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Glogel</span> for instance. </span><span class="sentence" id="2360">So we surrounded the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> one night and we disarmed the policemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="2361">They were not killed, but we took away everything they had there, rifles and guns, revolvers. </span><span class="sentence" id="2362">We took it away, and we completely demolished the <span class="BUILDING">police station</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2363">Then there was a very important <span class="DLF">railroad line</span> which went from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Senjisuv</span> (??). </span><span class="sentence" id="2364">This was not far from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> what I described you before. </span><span class="sentence" id="2365">So a few times those <span class="DLF">railroad tracks</span> were blown up, and the supplies... It was not so much the supplies, but in this time the Germans started to pull out a large quantity of soldiers in the army from the <span class="REGION">eastern part</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2366">And the <span class="DLF">railroads</span> were blown up with the soldiers, and this we did about 5, 6 times, those <span class="DLF">railroad lines</span> , which was easy to do because the <span class="DLF">railroad lines</span> were not actually guarded so much and we were not afraid for peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="2367">There was once an <span class="DLF">ammunition dump</span> and not far from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> ...before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Rzeszow</span> ...were big <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , dense <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forests</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2368">So once we went over there and this was everything with the Polish AK and we blew up one <span class="BUILDING">ammunition depot</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2369">The Germans later retaliated, but this group we knew we did it, so the same night we disappeared in the other <span class="NPIP">section</span> and actually, they didn't catch nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="2370">But they retaliated towards the local population. </span><span class="sentence" id="2371">They didn't know exactly who did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2372">Now one episode I want to tell you this is what we did on our own. </span><span class="sentence" id="2373">But I have to go back to that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> where we were after the destruction, after taking away our people from our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> when we were in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> when we destroyed the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2374">So we were working there, a Sharfuehrer came from the SS with a Polish boy, which he was his adjudant, his helper. </span><span class="sentence" id="2375">And this Sharfuehrer was very vicious and we knew about him that he killed and he beat and always he was always drunk. </span><span class="sentence" id="2376">He always was red in his face and nose was like...from a drunkard. </span><span class="sentence" id="2377">And he came to us while we were working, and it so happened that I loaded in this time some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">furniture</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2378">And I had a mirror in my hand, a big large mirror. </span><span class="sentence" id="2379">He said to me, "Look in this mirror.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2380">So I looked in his mirror. </span><span class="sentence" id="2381">He said, "Look what good cannon fodder you are, because this what you will be.‚Äù‚Äô </span><span class="sentence" id="2382">And I didn't answer, because you couldn't answer this man. </span><span class="sentence" id="2383">And he came to see what we are doing, and there was one of my friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="2384">His name was Motek Weiss. </span><span class="sentence" id="2385">He was from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , a very nice boy, fragile boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="2386">And he said to his adjudant, his name was Volstick, a Polish boy from the neighboring <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and he said to him to take a 2 by 4 and to start to beat this boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="2387">And he started to beat him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2388">He fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="2389">We put him on his feet. </span><span class="sentence" id="2390">He beat him again. </span><span class="sentence" id="2391">And he beat him so that he just was a piece of black flesh lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2392">And later we brought him back to our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , and the same day he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="2393">And just he did it for fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="2394">Uh...Later, he pointed out I should go with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2395">So I thought he was going to give me the same treatment as with this boy, but I couldn't say anything so I went with them and he said to me that he wants to get some brass. </span><span class="sentence" id="2396">He needs brass. </span><span class="sentence" id="2397">And we had brass from the old <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> , from old candlesticks, and in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in this <span class="BUILDING">warehouse</span> we kept only brass. </span><span class="sentence" id="2398">I took him to show him the brass. </span><span class="sentence" id="2399">While we went there to see the brass, we went through a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where there was paper collected. </span><span class="sentence" id="2400">Now they were mostly old books. </span><span class="sentence" id="2401">You know, by Jews, we don't throw away books. </span><span class="sentence" id="2402">Books were always saved. </span><span class="sentence" id="2403">We put them on the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> and if it was full, so we took the books into the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and we wrapped them in prayer shawls, and they were buried like human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="2404">So in this time when we cleaned out the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , there was full of old books. </span><span class="sentence" id="2405">Books that were hundred, two hundred years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="2406">They were yelllow. </span><span class="sentence" id="2407">We piled them (up). </span><span class="sentence" id="2408">We put them in this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2409">It was stacks till the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2410">And he came in and he start, he always had such a hoarse voice like a drunkard, and he asked me what's here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2411">I told him paper, books. "</span><span class="sentence" id="2412">What kind of books?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2413">I told him, "Religious books. </span><span class="sentence" id="2414">Jewish books.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2415">And the books were stacked on both sides of the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> that in the middle was just a <span class="DLF">passageway</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2416">And from the top there was a little <span class="DLF">window</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2417">And the <span class="DLF">window</span> , through the <span class="DLF">window</span> , rays of the sun came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="2418">And because there were books, old books there was a lot of dust, and the rays...the ray illuminated the dust that you could see through this <span class="DLF">window</span> came like a column of light on the one <span class="NPIP">spot</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2419">And in this moment, it reminded me that this column is the same column as God showed to the Israelites when they left <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> so they should know their way in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">desert</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2420">So in the evening, in the night, he had a column of light; in the day a column of dust. </span><span class="sentence" id="2421">And this was to show them the way how to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="2422">So in this moment, I remembered from the Bible, and I said, "This is the same column as God had it when the Israelites left <span class="COUNTRY">Egypt</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2423">And this Scharfuehrer s, did everything what God forbid probably the way he killed and he saw the spot from the ray on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and he stood in the <span class="NPIP">spot</span> and he looked up and he started to yell with his hoarse voice. </span><span class="sentence" id="2424">And he said, "Yehovah, Yehovah. </span><span class="sentence" id="2425">Wo bist Du.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2426">Means, "Yehovah, Yehovah, Where are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="2427">Yehovah, Warum hilfst Du nicht Deine Kinder?. "</span><span class="sentence" id="2428">Y ehovah, why don't you help your children?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2429">And he looked at me, and he said to me, "You see, Your Yehovah is old. </span><span class="sentence" id="2430">Your Yehovah is dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="2431">He cannot even hear what I am saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="2432">Now, here you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="2433">What we are doing to the Jews, and he doesn't do anything.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2434">And he spat on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , and he walked out. </span><span class="sentence" id="2435">In this moment, I was sure that God would punish him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2436">That God will make him lame or something will kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2437">After all, he said something bad about my God. </span><span class="sentence" id="2438">Maybe I had doubts of my God in this time that he didn't help us, but I think I had a right to have doubts because I was a Jew and I believed in God. </span><span class="sentence" id="2439">But he was a stranger, and he had no right to insult my God, and I was very angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="2440">And I said to myself, "I have to survive the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="2441">Even if I have to kill this guy, because he insulted my God.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2442">This was in this time when I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2443">Naturally, there was a thing that I knew that it could never happen. </span><span class="sentence" id="2444">How could I do it? </span><span class="sentence" id="2445">But..still I had in my mind. </span><span class="sentence" id="2446">Two years later...was it two years later?...almost two years later, a year and a half later I was in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , I found out that this man., </span><span class="sentence" id="2447">this Sharfuehrer, is in charge of <span class="DLF">Polish farms</span> in the <span class="REGION">section</span> where it was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Przeworsk</span> (¬∞?). </span><span class="sentence" id="2448"><span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Przeworsk</span> , the section I described before, belonged to the SS and he was in charge of the <span class="DLF">farms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2449">Because they didn't want to have Poles in this section, so they chased out all the Poles because this was where they perfected the V-1, V-2 rockets. </span><span class="sentence" id="2450">But they wanted to have something from the <span class="DLF">farms</span> , so the farmers used to go over there to work, and at night they went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="2451">And he was in charge of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2452">And I found out about it, and I was told also that every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, they have like drinkings with girls, playing cards, dancing in the substation from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Przeworsk camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2453">Now we had in our group two Jews who came from this vicinity. </span><span class="sentence" id="2454">One was a manager in an <span class="REGION">estate</span> , which knew very well the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and there was another one from this vicinity. </span><span class="sentence" id="2455">And also the father of the girl who helped me join the A, her name was Stashka Hodora. </span><span class="sentence" id="2456">She married later and her married...marriage name is Bargike . </span><span class="sentence" id="2457">She lives now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw</span> , and 2 years ago I brought her over for a visit. </span><span class="sentence" id="2458">So this Stashka's father used to go and he used to work in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they had those gatherings every Saturday and every Sunday. </span><span class="sentence" id="2459">And he was like a worker there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2460">He took care of the horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="2461">He took care of... So through him I find out that he takes care on all those things on this <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2462">And he told me and I had in my mind that something has to be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="2463">And I approached our group a few times and I said, this was an obsession with me that I had to do something towards him, but always my friends told me, "We cannot do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2464">We're not strong enough and to go and make a raid on SS group and we will be killed.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2465">And I gave up the idea. </span><span class="sentence" id="2466">When I left the AK and I came back, I still find out that through this Hodora, that he works there and this man is still there in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="2467">Then I find out that not far from us there was a group of Russian partisans. </span><span class="sentence" id="2468">You see, the front came closer to us, so also the partisans came closer to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2469">I find out where they are, and I went over to them, and I introduced myself that I am a leader from a partisan group. </span><span class="sentence" id="2470">I didn't tell them that we were Jews because we never knew how they will accept us, and there were a lot between the Russians...there were a lot of Ukrainians also. </span><span class="sentence" id="2471">And so I didn't say that we were Jews, but we were group and I have an idea that I want they should help us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2472">And I told them that I want to make a raid on 04:18: this <span class="BUILDING">substation</span> , and I explained to him why and that this man is there in charge. </span><span class="sentence" id="2473">He was very bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="2474">He killed a lot of people, and we can have a good job killing SS men. </span><span class="sentence" id="2475">And the head, the commandant of this group liked the idea, and it took us about two weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="2476">He gave me two from his group, and I went over with...with them at night to see the <span class="DLF">roads</span> , to see the topography, and to have the preparations how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2477">And when we came back, we picked out a dark night and we had all the information from this Jan Hodora. </span><span class="sentence" id="2478">Him I told what we're going to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="2479">I wasn't afraid that he would betray us because this was against the Germans, and he hated the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="2480">And this night, it was a Saturday night, we didn't have horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="2481">They had horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="2482">So I took from my group, I took five people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2483">And they gave us 15 people and 5 of them took us as passengers on their horses, and everything was planned and we came over. </span><span class="sentence" id="2484">Now five of us wore German uniforms. </span><span class="sentence" id="2485">I wore a German uniform, and four from the Russian partisans, and they gave me a submachine guns for us, and we came to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2486">And we cut the telephone wires, and we sneaked through the front, they were illuminated, the <span class="DLF">windows</span> where they were sitting, playing, dancing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2487">They had girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="2488">And we started to throw in grenades through the <span class="DLF">front windows</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2489">And meanwhile, the other people came from both sides and from the rear. </span><span class="sentence" id="2490">Now in the beginning it was a resistance. </span><span class="sentence" id="2491">They started to shoot back from revolvers because they didn't expect something like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="2492">And later their firing got less and less and after it stopped, we burned the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> where they were, and then later we took away the horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="2493">They had horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="2494">There was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> in the front, and there were a few <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2495">We burned the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2496">We burned the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">motorcycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2497">We took the horses, and we left. </span><span class="sentence" id="2498">Not one of them, we estimated that were about 35 SS men in this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="2499">When we looked in the <span class="DLF">windows</span> , more or less we estimated so many, not one escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="2500">Because it was such a surprise attack. </span><span class="sentence" id="2501">And from us, we came back. </span><span class="sentence" id="2502">All of us came back and nothing happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2503">Now when we came back and it was a wonderful feeling when I was there, and they gave me a submachine gun and I could shoot and shoot and shoot and I didn't feel anymore in this time like a fugitive. </span><span class="sentence" id="2504">I felt very, very good about myself, but we knew that something will happen that they would be seeking reprisals. </span><span class="sentence" id="2505">Right away the Russian group left. </span><span class="sentence" id="2506">They went to an other <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2507">They went more north. </span><span class="sentence" id="2508">We disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="2509">We were in this time...our group...with the five...we disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="2510">The next day the Germans came and they knew that this Russian group, Russian partisan group did it, and they surrounded the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> , and they searched and searched, but they didn't find nobody. </span><span class="sentence" id="2511">They didn't suspect the native Poles of helping us, so this was a very good feeling to do something now in this time and when I came back, so I said to myself I didn't do it so much for myself as I did it for insulting my God and this was a very, very good feeling. </span><span class="sentence" id="2512">Then later the rumors, not the rumors, the talk between the people, they told the story that this guy was killed in this raid, which we saw him through the <span class="DLF">window</span> anyway. </span><span class="sentence" id="2513">But he was well known also. </span><span class="sentence" id="2514">Also this Scharfuehrer, who was so vicious, he also spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="2515">For this reason, if they were like mixtures, they were even more vicious. </span><span class="sentence" id="2516">And the reason they used him because he spoke Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="2517">He could hire the peasants. </span><span class="sentence" id="2518">He could work with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2519">They should work in the <span class="DLF">fields</span> , and he was in charge of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="2520">So those were the things that we did that it was very gratifying. </span><span class="sentence" id="2521">We wanted to do more, but we were hampered by the Polish population. </span><span class="sentence" id="2522">And I have to tell you what happened the last night. </span><span class="sentence" id="2523">This was the last night before the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="2524">Now people ask you survived; it's a miracle or you are lucky or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2525">A thousand times you could be lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="2526">Somehow you outwitted the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="2527">Sometimes you made the right decision. </span><span class="sentence" id="2528">Instead to go left, you went right. </span><span class="sentence" id="2529">You had to be quick. </span><span class="sentence" id="2530">But if one time it didn't work, you didn't have a second chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="2531">The one time didn't work and that's it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2532">Now we don't know from all the people who were hiding and hiding and how many times they did things to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="2533">We don't know because they are not here to tell the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="2534">Now, if I will not be here now from the whole group that we were, hundred twenty five people, from the whole group when we were liberated, only six were alive, from the hundred twenty five. </span><span class="sentence" id="2535">And the rest were killed, very few by the Germans, mostly were killed by the Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="2536">Because the Germans didn't venture into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2537">And mostly by the end six were alive. </span><span class="sentence" id="2538">Now from the six, two from my people before the war, they were Rabbinical students and they were very nice boys and they were very capable, went back to our <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa</span> , because they said we are now free. </span><span class="sentence" id="2539">We are liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="2540">We'll come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="2541">We'll be considered heroes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2542">We survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="2543">So they went back 3 days after the liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="2544">Two were very prominent people from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> Poles, one was a Director of Internal Revenue. </span><span class="sentence" id="2545">His name was Kissel. </span><span class="sentence" id="2546">The other one had a bus company...had <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> going. </span><span class="sentence" id="2547">His name was Shilenski. </span><span class="sentence" id="2548">Took them to the <span class="DLF">cemetery</span> and they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2549">Three days after the liberation! </span><span class="sentence" id="2550">So imagine going through so much, going through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> , losing the whole family, starvation, and torture, being 2 years in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> , and somehow they made it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2551">They survived the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="2552">And the Germans were gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="2553">Here we are. </span><span class="sentence" id="2554">There is already liberty. </span><span class="sentence" id="2555">Now the Poles supposed to be our......we lived with them for thousand years. </span><span class="sentence" id="2556">Now they took the two boys and they killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2557">Why I will never know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2558">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="2559">What did they harm somebody? </span><span class="sentence" id="2560">And they were killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2561">So from all our group, there were four left. </span><span class="sentence" id="2562">My brother and I and two brothers who were also from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and they survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="2563">Six months later, one of them was poisoned so he died. </span><span class="sentence" id="2564">My brother died here about 15 years ago. </span><span class="sentence" id="2565">The second brother went to <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> and he died there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2566">So I'm the only one who survived from the whole group. </span><span class="sentence" id="2567">Now I have to speak in the name of all of them because nobody can tell any stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="2568">They are dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="2569">So my responsibility is to tell their stories. </span><span class="sentence" id="2570">Now I'm preparing episodes of everybody, the circumstances how he was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2571">And I remember more or less about everyone who was killed, how he was killed and when and by whom. </span><span class="sentence" id="2572">So I'm preparing stories for each one how he was killed from the hundred twenty six people. </span><span class="sentence" id="2573">Looking back on all those things, we cannot understand how a people like Polish people could do a thing like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="2574">I want to tell you then the last night and I went through so many things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2575">I didn't tell you how I was poisoned because there 1s not too much time about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2576">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="2577">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="2578">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="2579">Let's hear how you were poisoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2580">ANSWER:  So I want to tell you...I want to tell you about this last night. </span><span class="sentence" id="2581">If we will have time, we'll come back. </span><span class="sentence" id="2582">The last night I was back with my with my group. </span><span class="sentence" id="2583">There were only six left of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2584">So I went to the same peasant Hodora what he gave me the information, and his daughter was... So I went to see how the situation is. </span><span class="sentence" id="2585">Because the front was already by us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2586">The Germans went back and back, and we knew that we could hear the detonations and the shootings and came closer and closer. </span><span class="sentence" id="2587">When we came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hodora</span> that night nobody was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2588">The <span class="BUILDING">house</span> was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="2589">It was open. </span><span class="sentence" id="2590">It was empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="2591">The cows were not there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2592">So we understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="2593">Because they are afraid, the front comes close...near, so they went into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> because to be safer. </span><span class="sentence" id="2594">Nobody was there, so we decided to stay over the next day and the next night we'll see what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="2595">Now there was in the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> was full with hay because this was after the harvest, so we buried ourselves in the hay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2596">During the night we could hear that a unit of calvary is going through the <span class="DLF">road</span> , and the <span class="DLF">road</span> was very close to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> because you could hear horses, the chains ringing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2597">And then a few came in the <span class="DLF">yard</span> and they came into the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> where we were hiding. </span><span class="sentence" id="2598">And they started to take out hay for the horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="2599">Now we didn't know how much hay they would take out because if there could be a lot of horses, they could empty the <span class="BUILDING">barn</span> , and then later we'll be exposed, but as they took out the hay, we buried ourselves more and more and more. </span><span class="sentence" id="2600">Then later we heard them speaking that this night they will go. </span><span class="sentence" id="2601">Then later we came out and they were already gone, so I said to my friend, Leiba, I said, "We cannot stay here because this is the <span class="REGION">territory</span> that the <span class="REGION">German front</span> is establishing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2602">We have to go over to the east and to cross over probably the Russians are on the side.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2603">So we went to a <span class="NPIP">place</span> where there was a <span class="DLF">clearing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2604">This <span class="NPIP">side</span> the Germans were, and the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="2605">And we were...this was a <span class="DLF">clearing</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2606">So I said, "We have to move through the <span class="DLF">clearing</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2607">So he found a little brook and with this brook we started to crawl to go over to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2608">But somebody spotted us and they started to shot on us from both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2609">You see when one <span class="NPIP">side</span> started to shoot, so the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> started to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2610">So we knew here are the Germans, and here are the Russians and we're on the middle. </span><span class="sentence" id="2611">We jumped out from this little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">brook</span> and they were haystacks and we buried ourselves in the haystacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="2612">Then from a distance we saw a horse with two riders on it galloping, going about 200 yards away from us, coming from one side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> to the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="2613">Now this man, he was from a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> , and he said to me, "I cannot go out and ask him what's going on because they know me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2614">But they don't know you. </span><span class="sentence" id="2615">Go and ask them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2616">And I know those peasants.‚Äô </span><span class="sentence" id="2617">He even told me the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="2618">His name 1s Poslusne. </span><span class="sentence" id="2619">He said, "I know them because they are from my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2620">I even recognize the horse because I sold them the horse before I left the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2621">And he recognized. </span><span class="sentence" id="2622">Well, I thought he knows. </span><span class="sentence" id="2623">I came out from the haystack and I run after them, and I started to yell, Panie Poslusne. </span><span class="sentence" id="2624">And this was at night and they, finally, they heard me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2625">And they slowed down. </span><span class="sentence" id="2626">When they slowed I came closer to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2627">Now I saw it wasn't Poslusne. </span><span class="sentence" id="2628">It was two SS man, on one horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="2629">And this was from this unit of the horses what they sent them over as a patrol to go to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> to find out what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="2630">Here I'm standing there close to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2631">The liberation is almost here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2632">Freedom is almost here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2633">And I am standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2634">And they jumped out from the horse, both of them, took out their revolvers, pointing at me, and I looked like a peasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="2635">I was barefoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2636">And I had a jacket, a long jacket covered, and underneath the jacket I had my arsenal. </span><span class="sentence" id="2637">I had two revolvers, with a bayonet, with a hatchet, with a flashlight, bullets, everything I had underneath, but it was covered. </span><span class="sentence" id="2638">And when they jumped down, I didn't know what to say...what to start. </span><span class="sentence" id="2639">I couldn't show them I speak German, because Polish people didn't speak German. </span><span class="sentence" id="2640">So I started to yell and to cry in Polish and I told them what will I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="2641">My wife and my children went to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> with the cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="2642">Now they say the Russians are coming and there are rumors the Russians are raping the women and killing the children, taking away the cows. </span><span class="sentence" id="2643">What will I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="2644">What will I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="2645">Please help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2646">Help me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2647">And I said to them, "We are four or five years with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="2648">Nothing happened to us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2649">04:31: Now the Russians are coming, and there are so many rumors. </span><span class="sentence" id="2650">And then I figured I'm yelling to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2651">I'm crying, but they don't understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="2652">They are Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="2653">Then one of them started to translate in German to the other one what I am saying. </span><span class="sentence" id="2654">You see, you say luck, you say miracles. </span><span class="sentence" id="2655">Everything had to be, otherwise... So he started to translate. </span><span class="sentence" id="2656">When I see that he's translating, so I started to yell a little louder and cry a little more and tell him a little story because he understood. </span><span class="sentence" id="2657">And then he stopped me and he spoke to me in a very, very broken Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="2658">Probably he was from <span class="REGION">Silesia</span> , from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Posen</span> , something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2659">So he in very broken Polish, he ask me if I am from this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2660">I said, Yes.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2661">So he said to the other one in German, which I understood, he said, "Good, we don't have to go to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> ," because they were afraid to go deeper because they will be killed because they knew the Russians are there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2662">So he said, "We will take him to our commandant, and let him question him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2663">Maybe he can give us the information we want to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="2664">So he told me in Polish not to worry. </span><span class="sentence" id="2665">They will take me for questioning and then later they will go with me to find my wife and the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="2666">Well, he said it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2667">So then they said to me to go in front of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2668">And I went in front of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2669">And they both put back their revolvers. </span><span class="sentence" id="2670">And they had rifles on their back and they climbed on their horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="2671">They went back on the horse and I started to walk slowly in front of them and they behind me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2672">Now I started to realize, ...here the whole war I went through. </span><span class="sentence" id="2673">Here the liberation coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="2674">Now I have to be shot, because if they will take me over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2675">Now listen, if they will open my vest, they will see. </span><span class="sentence" id="2676">How can I survive? </span><span class="sentence" id="2677">So what...what should I do? </span><span class="sentence" id="2678">I have to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2679">I always 04:33 had a long barrel revolver in my belt. </span><span class="sentence" id="2680">I never had it in my holster. </span><span class="sentence" id="2681">I had it always ready. </span><span class="sentence" id="2682">So by going in the front so a little, I put in my hand and I cocked the revolver. </span><span class="sentence" id="2683">I pulled it out slowly, and suddenly I turned around. </span><span class="sentence" id="2684">In a split second I emptied it and I shot seven bullets in them and they fell down dead from the horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="2685">Because I knew I had to. </span><span class="sentence" id="2686">And they fell down. </span><span class="sentence" id="2687">The minute I started to shoot on them so bullets, millions of bullets from both <span class="NPIP">sides</span> came in my direction because the Germans were here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2688">The Russians were here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2689">They didn't know what's going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="2690">So they started to shoot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2691">So I took the horse as a shield and I started to walk slowly toward the <span class="REGION">Russian side</span> , and I call...yal...I bent down, and first thing I took out the revolvers again. </span><span class="sentence" id="2692">This was very important. </span><span class="sentence" id="2693">I put them in my belt to take away, and I went to the <span class="NPIP">side</span> from the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="2694">I was about hundred feet away from the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2695">A few jumped out and they surrounded me and they said in Russian I should lift my hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="2696">So they spoke to me in Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="2697">I was very relieved and I came in and they asked me what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="2698">So I told them what happened, that the two Germans and I shot them and the revolvers. </span><span class="sentence" id="2699">First thing they relieved me...they took away everything I had, and they said, "Let's wait til our commandant comes.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2700">About a half a hour later, the commandant came, a young fellow on a horse and he asked me, so I told him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2701">He asked me, "Who are you.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2702">I said to him, "I have a group of partisans in the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2703">Again I didn't say Polish or Jewish because you never knew because even then they killed a lot of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="2704">And those I didn't know they're Ukrainian or Russians, so they and I spoke a little Russian because I was in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> a few months. </span><span class="sentence" id="2705">He was very surprised that I speak Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="2706">So when I told him the whole story except , first they took the horses. </span><span class="sentence" id="2707">Oh, I like the horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="2708">This will be my horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="2709">They took away. </span><span class="sentence" id="2710">So I said, "I'm going back for my group. </span><span class="sentence" id="2711">I have there a group about 60 people.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2712">He said, "Don't go back to the group, because if you will come back they will probably shoot you, all of you on the way coming out from the <span class="DLF">German line</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2713">He said, "You are already here. </span><span class="sentence" id="2714">Stay with us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2715">We are...we accepting you. </span><span class="sentence" id="2716">We will take you in. </span><span class="sentence" id="2717">Come with me.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2718">So I even told them, "When I go back to show the people that that I met Russian partisans, why don't you give me your submachine guns.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2719">It's called in Russian papetsha. "</span><span class="sentence" id="2720">Why don't you give me your papetsha, and I will go up and I will show them that I have met the Russians.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2721">He said, "Oh, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="2722">When you come back to me, you get it from me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2723">But to make sure, to show them that you met the Russians, he took off his hat and he took off the star with the sickle and and hammer and said, "Show them this and this will be proof enough.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2724">And he said, "Go and bring them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2725">We will wait til morning for you.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2726">He asked me, "How long will it take to bring them over.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2727">I said, "Maybe 2 hours.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2728">He said, "That will be enough time. </span><span class="sentence" id="2729">Bring them over.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2730">Now when he told me this and when I walked away I was sure he doesn't believe me the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="2731">Because he was too lenient and he let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="2732">Now why should I go back? </span><span class="sentence" id="2733">Why should I be so stupid go back to the <span class="DLF">German line</span> and bring over people? </span><span class="sentence" id="2734">He probably thought that I am sent out from the <span class="REGION">German side</span> to find out if there are people, how many, and I was sure that the minute I would turn around, when I went away, he took away my two revolvers from the two Germans but he gave me back mine. </span><span class="sentence" id="2735">And I was sure that I would turn around that in the back I will be shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2736">So when I started I walk like I was walking like on <span class="DLF">air</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2737">I couldn't move my legs, but I start and farther I went I was more sure for myself and when I was already about 200 feet so I figured well now maybe, I'm safe. </span><span class="sentence" id="2738">They will not shoot me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2739">And then I started to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="2740">I run back to the haystack where my friend was lying there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2741">Naturally, he grabbed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2742">He kissed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2743">He was sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="2744">He thought that I am dead, that I'm shot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2745">He didn't know that I killed the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="2746">So I said, "Let's go. </span><span class="sentence" id="2747">This is not for us.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2748">So we went the same way and we went where the two Germans were laying dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="2749">So going through...so then we helped ourselves to their two rifles because...we took off the two rifles, and we went over the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2750">We went there to a <span class="BUILDING">peasant hut</span> , and we were waiting there a whole night. </span><span class="sentence" id="2751">In the morning somebody opened the <span class="DLF">barn door</span> and I see a Russian soldier comes in with some pot and he came in. </span><span class="sentence" id="2752">He wanted to milk a cow to get some milk. </span><span class="sentence" id="2753">I jumped down and I asked him, "What's going on?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2754">He said, "Well, we liberated this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> this night.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2755">I grabbed him and I hugged him and I danced around and this was my liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="2756">So the reason why I told you this story, this was the last night. </span><span class="sentence" id="2757">Now the last night I would if I wouldn't have the quick mind to turn around to kill them or something like this, I would be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="2758">It so happens that every day something else happened and every day, oh, you had to outsmart somebody or you had to be quick about something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2759">And this is the way that mostly survivors survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="2760">See, if somebody survived in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> he couldn't do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="2761">If he didn't die of typhus, and he didn't die of starvation, he wasn't picked out in a selection to be gassed, he survived because he didn't have to fight himself...by himself to outwit...to do something. </span><span class="sentence" id="2762">He had to be strong to wait and not to be gassed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2763">But when you were on your own in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> or like my wife on illegal papers, every day was a challenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="2764">Every day you had to do something to live another day. </span><span class="sentence" id="2765">Now you were asking me a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="2766">I didn't tell you this before. </span><span class="sentence" id="2767">Why do I tell all those stories? </span><span class="sentence" id="2768">There are people, survivors who don't want to open their mouths, and they will shut up and they don't tell because the pains come back and they cannot sleep nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="2769">You don't sleep nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="2770">You dream about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2771">The next day you think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2772">And this 1s a vicious circle. </span><span class="sentence" id="2773">It goes day after day after night. </span><span class="sentence" id="2774">I think every survivor survived for a reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="2775">I survived for two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="2776">I had two legacies why I survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="2777">And this gave me strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="2778">One legacy was when my father was shot (I told you this before) the last words was, "Revenge, revenge, revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="2779">Take revenge.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2780">And I wanted to survive. </span><span class="sentence" id="2781">I wanted to join a special unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="2782">For this reason, I joined right away the army, and I wanted to join a unit that could give me the possibility of revenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="2783">I took revenge as much as I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="2784">Looking back, some people say well revenge is not sweet because it doesn't bring anybody to life. </span><span class="sentence" id="2785">But if you will ask a person who went through so much and you will say if you have a chance to take revenge maybe not so much for me because I'm alive and this what I went through doesn't mean anything, but for the people who are not alive, the people who are killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2786">And if I took revenge for my father, I did it gladly. </span><span class="sentence" id="2787">Now after so many years, we live in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2788">It's a normal life. </span><span class="sentence" id="2789">We have to live like human beings, not to be like animals. </span><span class="sentence" id="2790">Like in this time everybody was an animal. </span><span class="sentence" id="2791">This gave me strength. </span><span class="sentence" id="2792">The second strength gave me when my mother was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Belzec</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2793">She somehow sent to somebody a letter to me when I was in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kolbuszowa camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2794">And she wrote me in the letter and she said, "You are the youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="2795">You are young. </span><span class="sentence" id="2796">You are my youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="2797">You are young. </span><span class="sentence" id="2798">You are healthy, and you are a witness.‚Äù "</span><span class="sentence" id="2799">So go on," and she said, "Let the thing that you are an orphan and let it not break you. </span><span class="sentence" id="2800">You go on and live. </span><span class="sentence" id="2801">Live. </span><span class="sentence" id="2802">Go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> and tell 1t to David.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2803">David was my brother.

<p><span class="sentence" id="2866">ANSWER:  Was the Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="2867">But you see, with the Russians I didn't stay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2868">The Russians I only came to them and I asked them for help. </span><span class="sentence" id="2869">I asked them for help to do this thing with this Scharfuehrer, which they agreed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2870">So I was with them altogether about 2 weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="2871">Til we prepared those things. </span><span class="sentence" id="2872">And then later after, they wanted me to stay with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2873">But I figured the war 1s closing and closing and I had enough and I wanted to be liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="2874">Then I said to myself I will join the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="2875">I don't want to be in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">woods</span> anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="2876">But the main thing, the longest time I was with the Jewish group, but unfortunately, there was very, very few left of us.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2877">QUESTION:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2878">If you can, tell me about when you were poisoned. </span><span class="sentence" id="2879">04:45:
ANSWER:  Okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="2880">This was after we were shot by...when I was shot by the Agustins by the two brothers what I killed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="2881">And I went to the AK. </span><span class="sentence" id="2882">But my brother, as we run away from them, it was a very high snow. </span><span class="sentence" id="2883">We stopped on the way by a friendly peasant and he gave us some old clothing and also he gave me a pair of shoes which fitted me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2884">But for my brother he didn't have shoes because they didn't fit my brother...the too large foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2885">So we had to run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="2886">And we went through a meadow which was low and it was covered with snow and underneath it was water, but was it covered with a very thin layer of ice. </span><span class="sentence" id="2887">And as we walked, he broke the ice and the ice was so sharp that it cut his feet and it cut off the skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="2888">He didn't feel it because it was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="2889">When we came to our group, we saw that his feet are without skin. </span><span class="sentence" id="2890">Naturally, we washed. </span><span class="sentence" id="2891">We couldn't go to a doctor. </span><span class="sentence" id="2892">We washed, and we put in some bandages. </span><span class="sentence" id="2893">And he had to put some <span class="NPIP">place</span> to recuperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="2894">So we brought him back to the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> where this shooting went on, but to a peasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="2895">His name was Avisha...that he used to work for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="2896">He used to bring merchandise to my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="2897">And we trusted him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2898">And I didn't want to show that I am there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2899">Because even my brother would be there, they would be afraid to do something to him I should remain as a witness. </span><span class="sentence" id="2900">So my brother...I left him on the <span class="DLF">roof</span> [attic?] </span><span class="sentence" id="2901">in the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> and when he came to milk the cows he told them he's there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2902">And he used to bring him every day about 5, 6 o'clock a quart of soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="2903">And this was his food that he ate, that he brought him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2904">Every evening he brought him a hot quart of soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="2905">One day I came over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2906">And he noticed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2907">And I was afraid that he should see me there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2908">Even I trusted him, but I figured those two boys were his friends and they belonged to the same group. </span><span class="sentence" id="2909">When he noticed me, the same day, he didn't bring us food. </span><span class="sentence" id="2910">And I told him, "I am here, but I want to tell you one thing.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2911">I asked him, what's going on in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2912">He said, "Nothing, Nothing.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2913">And I didn't believe him because it was not nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="2914">I killed two of the best boys in this <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2915">04:48: How could be nothing nothing? </span><span class="sentence" id="2916">He didn't tell me this. </span><span class="sentence" id="2917">And everybody knew that I did it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2918">So when it was dark he didn't bring the food like every evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="2919">Usually he brought the food about 5, 6 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="2920">It was 7 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="2921">He didn't bring the food. </span><span class="sentence" id="2922">It was 8 o'clock. </span><span class="sentence" id="2923">He came over and he brought a quart, he brought a pot with soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="2924">Usually, it was hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2925">This time it was cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="2926">And he left. </span><span class="sentence" id="2927">Usually, he waited til my brother would finish the soup, and he would take back the pot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2928">This time he gave it and he run away. </span><span class="sentence" id="2929">He went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="2930">So I said to my brother, I said, "Don't eat it because I don't trust it for a few reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="2931">The first thing I'm here with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="2932">They know they got us both together. </span><span class="sentence" id="2933">The second thing he usually brought it between 5 and 6. </span><span class="sentence" id="2934">Now it's already 8. </span><span class="sentence" id="2935">Why so different? </span><span class="sentence" id="2936">Always, it was hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2937">Now it's cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="2938">He always waited for the empty pot. </span><span class="sentence" id="2939">Now he didn't wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="2940">He went away. </span><span class="sentence" id="2941">So he said, "Oh, we can trust him. </span><span class="sentence" id="2942">Don't think that he will do something.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2943">I said, "No, I will not eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2944">And you don't eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2945">I advise you.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2946">He started to eat it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2947">And when he start to eat, after a while he started to scream...he said, "I don't feel good. </span><span class="sentence" id="2948">I have pains. </span><span class="sentence" id="2949">I have cramps. </span><span class="sentence" id="2950">I think I'm poisoned.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2951">So I poured out the soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="2952">I said, "Wait.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2953">And I jumped on downstairs the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> , and I started to milk the cow. </span><span class="sentence" id="2954">And I milked a full pot of milk and I came up and I said to him, "Drink the milk, the whole thing and then later, try to throw up " So he drink the milk, put in his finger in his mouth and his throat and he threw up. </span><span class="sentence" id="2955">I said, "Now, let's go.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2956">Now he still had trouble with his feet, but we went down. </span><span class="sentence" id="2957">I said, "I want to wait. </span><span class="sentence" id="2958">I want to see who is coming for our bodies.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2959">So we were waiting there on the opposite <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2960">Was very cold. </span><span class="sentence" id="2961">And this I remember how cold it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="2962">And it took about 20 minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="2963">Four guys came 1n with flashlights and I saw them going in in the <span class="BUILDING">stable</span> and there was a <span class="INT_SPACE">loft</span> , came up the <span class="DLF">ladder</span> with a flashlight, took a second there. </span><span class="sentence" id="2964">They came down and they started to run. </span><span class="sentence" id="2965">They run away, and then said to him, "Now, we can go.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2966">But I knew...I knew who came so I said to him, "We will wait about a week or two and we will burn their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2967">This, Franek Zavishes <span class="BUILDING">house</span> I didn't touch. </span><span class="sentence" id="2968">Because he really was nice, and maybe they forced him to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="2969">But others I said, "After a few weeks, we will burn their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> .‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2970">See they were afraid to come and to shoot because I told them, "Anybody who will come up on the <span class="INT_SPACE">attic</span> and he will show his head, I will blow 04:51: his head off.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="2971">So after the war, after the liberation, I invited this Franek when I was a big shot in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , so I invited Franek to come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , and he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="2972">And I asked him in this time, I said, "Tell me the truth. </span><span class="sentence" id="2973">What happened this night?" </span><span class="sentence" id="2974">So he tells me there was a doctor who belonged to his group. </span><span class="sentence" id="2975">His name was Vosna Volski. </span><span class="sentence" id="2976">After they told him that I am coming there, he gave them four pills of poison. </span><span class="sentence" id="2977">And the four pills he suppose to put in in our food, but he didn't want to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2978">This what he told me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2979">He didn't want to kill us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2980">He only wanted to threaten us. </span><span class="sentence" id="2981">So he only put in one pill. </span><span class="sentence" id="2982">And later I find out that one pill could kill 25 people, not two. </span><span class="sentence" id="2983">But he wanted to scare us we should run away so he put in only one pill and three he didn't put in. </span><span class="sentence" id="2984">This he told me after we were liberated and he came. </span><span class="sentence" id="2985">And my wife 04:52: was sitting there because I knew her in this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="2986">And then then I knew which doctor and how it was.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2987">QUESTION:  Very briefly in about three minutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2988">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2989">QUESTION:  Tell me. </span><span class="sentence" id="2990">After liberation, you joined the Polish Army. </span><span class="sentence" id="2991">Tell me about that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="2994">ANSWER:  I went and I joined. </span><span class="sentence" id="2995">I didn't have to go, but I joined and I wanted to be a part of the Polish Army, and I volunteered to join the air force. </span><span class="sentence" id="2996">Because I wanted they should teach me and I should be a pilot and maybe I will be able to bomb <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2997">And the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> for officers for the air force was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kuibichov</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2998">This was in <span class="REGION">Siberia</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="2999">So when I waited for a transported, then I met a young Polish officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="3000">She was a beautiful, nice girl in that uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="3001">She went through us, and we waited for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> for the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="3002">And we started to talk. </span><span class="sentence" id="3003">And she said, "What're you doing here?" </span><span class="sentence" id="3004">And I told this. </span><span class="sentence" id="3005">She said, "Well, you're going to be a pilot. </span><span class="sentence" id="3006">It takes 2 years.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="3007">The war wouldn't last 2 years anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="3008">So why don't you come with me and you join our unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="3009">We have a special unit, and if you want to take revenge, you will take plenty of revenge.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="3010">And I said, "How can I do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="3011">I have already the orders to go.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="3012">She said, "Don't worry.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="3013">And she took me to her colonel and she showed him the orders. </span><span class="sentence" id="3014">He took the orders and he ripped them up and he said, "From now on, you will be with us.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="3015">And I joined them, and this is how I joined, this is how I met my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="3016">Because after six months, when we had to liberate <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , so I was already a big shot in this time and I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> and then when I find out about my wife and I came to have her killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="3017">And this is a different story and this my wife probably will tell the story. </span><span class="sentence" id="3018">Because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> had to be destroyed completely. </span><span class="sentence" id="3019">And my wife was the secretary of the company who made the <span class="DLF">barricades</span> and before we entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> , we had to find somebody to get the plans to dismantle those <span class="DLF">barricades</span> and through channels and channels we find out that it's her and three were sent out to get those plans. </span><span class="sentence" id="3020">And I was one of the three. </span><span class="sentence" id="3021">This was one day before <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> was liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="3022">So I entered <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> January the 18th 1945 and officially <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> was liberated January the 19th. </span><span class="sentence" id="3023">And my wife will tell you the rest story. </span><span class="sentence" id="3024">I thought she's German. </span><span class="sentence" id="3025">I hated her. </span><span class="sentence" id="3026">She was beautiful. </span><span class="sentence" id="3027">I saw my five sisters in here and we made up that after we get the plans, we'd kill her. </span><span class="sentence" id="3028">And then she looked at me. </span><span class="sentence" id="3029">When I came in, I started to interrogate her. </span><span class="sentence" id="3030">She thought I am the biggest anti-Semitic Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="3031">She said, "You're a snob," but later she told me, "You're a snub nose and you're slavic, slavic face features.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="3032">But anyway I find out that she's Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="3033">She find out I am Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="3034">She was very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="3035">And this was our meeting. </span><span class="sentence" id="3036">And we had to still go through in the war...January, February, March, April, May...This was still war. </span><span class="sentence" id="3037">And then later in November, we got married.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3038">QUESTION:  When did you come to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3039">ANSWER:  We came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> January 1947. </span><span class="sentence" id="3040">After I was transferred I escaped. </span><span class="sentence" id="3041">I was in the <span class="REGION">German zone</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> about 6 months, and then we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3042">We wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> in this time, but it was impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="3043">So we came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with the thought of going from here to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3044">And this is other story. </span><span class="sentence" id="3045">This is the other chapter and another book. </span><span class="sentence" id="3046">But we are here, and we are very happy to be in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3047"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> did for me more than I expected. </span><span class="sentence" id="3048">I never dreamed that American can do this for me what actually I achieved. </span><span class="sentence" id="3049">And now we had a daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="3050">We are very happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="3051">My daughter has three little boys. </span><span class="sentence" id="3052">And this is the most important thing is to show that Hitler didn't completely succeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="3053">He wanted to erase every European Jew in the Jewish race, and we are a continuation. </span><span class="sentence" id="3054">Now one I want to tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="3055">After the war, we contemplated...we didn't know what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="3056">I was already a Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="3057">I had established position. </span><span class="sentence" id="3058">My wife was Polish, an established position. </span><span class="sentence" id="3059">And we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="3060">She started to study medicine in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="3061">So we didn't know what should we do. </span><span class="sentence" id="3062">Should we become Jews and run away or should we stay and be Poles and maybe to save our future generations the heartache and the problems that we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="3063">And we started to think about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="3064">What should we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="3065">And we decided no. </span><span class="sentence" id="3066">Because we cannot do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="3067">For two reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="3068">My wife couldn't do it because she had her family and her grandmother, uncles and her sister in <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3069">I couldn't do it because, it so happens we spoke yesterday about <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kohanim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3070">I am from the <span class="DLF">line</span> of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kohanim</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="3071">Now we know by Jews are very strict to follow male after male, and our lineage goes back til Aaron the high priest, the brother of Moses. </span><span class="sentence" id="3072">And I said, "Who am I to cut this chain. </span><span class="sentence" id="3073">My father was killed because he was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="3074">Maybe his forefathers were killed because they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="3075">I have no right to come to me...1t reached me after 2...after three and and a half thousand years. </span><span class="sentence" id="3076">Because since Aaron is between three and and half thousand years and four thousand. </span><span class="sentence" id="3077">Who am I that I should cut this <span class="DLF">line</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="3078">So I said, "For this reason, we have to remain Jews, and we shouldn't be the one to say this 1s it.‚Äù </span><span class="sentence" id="3079">If we would do it, 1t means that Hitler succeeded. </span><span class="sentence" id="3080">We will resign from being Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="3081">For this reason, we had to continue."</span></p>
