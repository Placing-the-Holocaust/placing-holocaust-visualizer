<p><span class="sentence" id="18">QUESTION:  Tell me what changed when the Russians came.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="19">ANSWER:  It was a little different because you will -- I was going to a, to <span class="BUILDING">Hebrew school</span> and then all of a sudden I was going to a <span class="BUILDING">Jewish school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">They are cutting down on the <span class="REGION">religious part</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">They were trying to make all the children like sort like patriotic and, of course, when you're young you think is the future. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">But my father was always against the regime because of Communism. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">In fact, he got arrested one time. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">One time he got a chicken he was carrying this to the <span class="DLF">street</span> and he was stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">What do you have a chicken for? </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And he was afraid to tell everything to go to officially. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">They arrested him and after a couple hours, but they let them out. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">They didn't want to get the men for the chicken. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">You can imagine my father didn't care much for the Communists. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">But I was not myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">I liked the movie and things like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">But 1t was really normal. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">It was a little different with the new regime, but I was too young to see the difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">QUESTION:  Let me ask you to go back before the Russians came. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">You said there was a lot of Antisemitism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  There was because I can experience to start with, because I remember my father bought a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> for my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I was the younger and he was a year older. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">We were riding one time and I was saying, let me ride, let me ride, and all of sudden there was a few boys, not Jewish, and one of them got a stick and put it right in the springs and he broke the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> , and like young boys, of course, we chasing them. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">You broke the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="40">How come you broke the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="41">And where I was living in -- we got a little farther out -- was a <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and we chased them to the <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and, of course, course the police came out and let the two buys in and he put the foot in this <span class="DLF">door</span> and he told us, go away you Zyds. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">I told them and this time, of course, I spoke. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">I forgot —Lithuanian, I was going born there-- them I told him he broke the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and he kept saying, go away. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">Of course, I couldn’t fight him. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">It was experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">We came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and my father took this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> to the man that fixed the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycle</span> and fixed it. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But you had a feeling like you were always not so welcome, like because I'm Jewish.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  Did you have Lithuanian friends?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">ANSWER:  Like I said, I was neighbors with a few of them, but in general I was in the <span class="BUILDING">Cheder</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="50">But in the <span class="REGION">area</span> I was living there was Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">But we had a few people from the a <span class="BUILDING">restaurant</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">His son was a little friendly with us, and we were playing as children, but didn't have too many Lithuanian friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="53">QUESTION:  Did you hear about the Germans and the Nazis while the Russians were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="54">ANSWER:  Oh, of course, in 1933 when the Russians came into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Of course, my father was a middle-aged man and he talked about it with my mother, and he showed the papers a little bit, in the Jewish papers and the Lithuanian papers what was going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , the liquidations and the killing over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">And it was we started. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">A lot of Jewish run away from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and come to <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="58">In fact, when the army, the Polish army, fight the Germans they came to Lithuanian because some of them didn't want to stay with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">But most of them was happy to have the Germans in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="60">QUESTION:  You were very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">Did you hear your parents talking about it and did you read the newspapers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">I couldn't understand a little bit and there was politic involved, and I could hear it and feel it, and when I see in the, whatever, I saw in the paper I realized this that we are not welcome. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">Something is going to come back and my father kept saying what was the next step. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">He didn't realize that the Germans were going to attack the Russians this time, but when the war started and they start feeling that the Germans are coming. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">But my father reading the papers and knowing what is going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">It's time to leave everything and run because what is going on in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> is maybe going to be the same thing here in <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="68">And we had a horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> , and I have a lot of stories to tell. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">We had a small little horse and we are using it to take the coals from -- it was a little like a pony. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">It was like a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">You talk to him like a dog and this horse was doing things that were believable. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">And my father had two horses but my father took the smaller horse and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and take the few things we can take with us, and we made the journey to run away from the <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And the Germans were always bombing the <span class="BUILDING">airport</span> , and a lot of Jews start running to get away from the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  And this is in 1941?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  This is in 1941. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">And only the same time these bombs was falling and, of course, the Lithuanians were so happy to see the Germans coming, they're sabotaging the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Russian Army tanks</span> , putting on fire and burning 6 the tire and shooting on them. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">And all of sudden their own rifles and putting on the Lithuania uniform and really taking advantage of the situation and start right away with the Jews, of course, but we didn't have enough- it was too fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">We left. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">They day they started throwing the bombs, my father took the horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and we was going to get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">And we are running the <span class="DLF">streets</span> with the Russian Army and we were going to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="81">A lot of people in this <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="82">You can go to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> and then to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> , and then from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> to <span class="REGION">White Russia</span> , but we didn't make the journey so far. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">We just took that horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">We have involved with the Russian Army and then, of course, the Germans were bombing the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and we were going through the <span class="DLF">hole</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">I say the Holocaust, dead people right away from the first time, and my mother, in fact, was shot, slit. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">The bomb cut in her leg we were running in this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">We were going in the same direction as the Russian army. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">There was always fires and dead people on the <span class="DLF">streets</span> and a lot of them couldn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">You know, the soldiers and a lot of people riding the horses didn't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">We kept on going and then, of course, we came to the border of <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="91">We came in at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="92">There was a lot of Latvian people there, but we hear right away from the Gentile people that something going on, terrible things going on against the Jews, even in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Minsk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="93">But we were lucky and we were still going in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> with the Russians, the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">But the army was really practically 99 percent in a chaos, didn't know what they are doing. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">One was running right and one was running left, and then I remember one thing, that we were running, going with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and two Jewish guys came over and said you have to give us a ride. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">My father said, Look, I got a little tiny horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We have four people. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">We won't make it. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">They took out a revolver and they point it at my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">They said, look, you are going to sit down and we are going with you. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">Also because we can’t walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">They might look a little Communist inclined, I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Maybe they are soldiers, and then we are running like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">Not running, driving and driving and driving and then, all of a sudden we had an attack with machine guns and I felt -- I was in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with my mother and my brother and my father was driving the horse and the two men, and then all of a sudden we hear a something. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">We hear a scream and one of them says, Oy, Oy. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">We look and then he laying, fall back and a bullet went right in the man part, in this -- right in his, in the part, the men part, and it went in this -- excuse the expression -- right in where it aches for the men. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">He could feel the bullet. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">He could touch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">The other man said, don't do nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Drive faster the horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Drive the horse, and then we were already in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , and then we stopped and they are still with us two days, and then this man stopped some other people and, of course, speak fluent Russian and they made us stop for a day, like a half a day and they said we should go closer to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="112">And they took him out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and they said to us, they thanked us for the ride and giving them the ride and we left them right by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And I said, how can you leave them by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="114">And he said, I made arrangements to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> because the other side of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> , the Russian Army was a little bit more organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">It could start to fight back. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">It made like a <span class="REGION">zone</span> to fight back, and we left them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">My father didn't want to leave the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">After all, he didn't know him and now the man is wounded, and they kept on saying -- I was a boy and I could see that it was his part and there was a bullet, and the other man was going to take it out and my father said, don't do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">You'll kill him. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And anyway we left him by the edge of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> and we started going farther. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">We are already -- my father and my brother and my mother alone, and my father kept the tallis, you know, the tallis what you 9 wear, and he keep it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> with him, and this he took with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">We are going there and then nobody to talk, but luckily my father was fluent in <span class="COUNTRY">Latvian</span> , is different, similar but different. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">My mother didn't speak <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , and I, of course, didn't and my brother didn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">Then he hear some from -- somebody told us that we are Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">You are one of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">The Germans were not even there yet. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">We didn't know what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And go there, make a left and a right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">And there was a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and there was a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">Maybe he can give you directions. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Anyway, we came over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">He had a <span class="DLF">farm</span> and two sons and all kinds of animals there, chickens and cows and pigs, and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And there was a little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and the whole people looked like they like them over there because he was a very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">And my father said to him, what should we do? </span><span class="sentence" id="135">And he said, I am in the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> like you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">The war was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">We didn't know how long it was going to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">So stay with us for a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">And we stay for two or three days, and then on the other side of the <span class="DLF">farm</span> was close to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">water</span> , maybe a quarter of a mile. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">And my father said to him, maybe we could go over to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But we couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">He wanted to go over. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">The reason -- I skipped a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">The reason we came to this 10 <span class="NPIP">place</span> , he wanted to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">The Russian go over to <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">There was <span class="DLF">bridge</span> and the Russian Army exploded the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> because -- then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> and the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">Their own people. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">There was a lot of Jewish, and on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , we were lucky not to make the time on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="149">If we were on the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> we would be exploded too. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Right before our eyes we saw the <span class="DLF">bridge</span> collapsing and there was a lot of Russian people running around in their underpants, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">With their rifles and they couldn't even walk. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">They got on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="153">We remained on our side and the people on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , there was still the army holding the gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">But a couple days on the <span class="DLF">farm</span> with this man I said to my father, let me see what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">And we took the little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">We really wanted to go over. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">He said, I can't take anyone right now. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I was going in the nighttime. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">I was not there and my father, said oh, my God, what is going on there? </span><span class="sentence" id="160">They are fighting with the Germans and and the Jewish and he found out. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">And they couldn't make it back on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , but he came back with this man from the <span class="DLF">farm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And he came back and said, look, he said, it is bad. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">I am taking my horse and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> and I am going. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">He had some people that came to him and said, ride it out from the 11 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And we are left completely alone, and this was like in evening and I said to my father -- and my father's name was Heim(ph) -- and he shake hands with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">I got my family and you have yours. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">I have to go my way. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I can't take you where I'm going. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">We go where we can and then, of course, we made the journey to go back because we couldn't go to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">We were trying to go back from where we came. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">That's why I said the little horse was like a dog. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">We didn't know where to go and my father said to him, go horse. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">He didn't know where to go and he was afraid to ask for directions, things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">And luckily like I said in the beginning, my father speaks <span class="COUNTRY">Latvia</span> , and we starting to move back in one little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> and , the small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="175">And all of a sudden we hear from the people, the Gentile people, the Germans are moving slowly. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And then all of a sudden we see a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German truck</span> with soldiers and oh, my father said, we are already under the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">We caught from the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">We are going. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">My father was smart and took that horse and took some mud and smeared up the horse and made the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">wagon</span> look like farmers and look not like Jewish people, because he hide the tallis that he had. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">We are going there and people are greeting us. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">People thought we are going from one , from one little 12 <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> to another little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="182">We are going back to where we go back to from there we went to . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">We saw where we came to before we go with the Russians and we saw the bombs. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">We didn't see the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="185">It was really wiped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">It was bombed. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">We didn't want to go but still some <span class="BUILDING">buildings</span> were still remaining there, and then all of a sudden we come in on the <span class="DLF">highways</span> where the German Army with this music with this big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> of ___ and <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tanks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">And we are five going farther than them. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">We are going farther and they are going backwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">And they kept on saying in German , things like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">We knew how to speak German too and, of course, my father knew we are all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">But of course, my father knew more, but the Jewish and German is very similar. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">But in this experience we are going down to a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a bag to grab it and saw it on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and it exploded. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">It was like a bomb. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">They didn't know if we are Jewish or not, but they

class="sentence" id="1270">They said to the people, where are your possessions? </span><span class="sentence" id="1271">All of the people before they go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">shower</span> , they have had a <span class="DLF">ditch</span> out like a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilet</span> and you sit over this and behind, and they make the and you can see it was falling. </span><span

id="1274">It was a long <span class="DLF">ditch</span> I would say around five or six hundred foot long. </span><span class="sentence" id="1275">And when they came out and said -- a lot of people, you know, saving diamond ring or some money, whatever they had from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , throw it in the <span class="DLF">ditch</span> to give to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1276">Somehow they give to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1277">Somehow they had work for it and they came out and they said they'd like to have all the doctors, the lawyers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1278">I have special work for them and we have a lot of intelligent people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1279">My father was going but I can't. </span><span class="sentence" id="1280">I'm too young, but my father didn't want to raise his hand to say he was not a doctor, but Jewish people are a lot of intelligent people. </span><span

QUESTION:  You were describing this <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> , this <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1326">ANSWER:  Right. </span><span class="sentence" id="1327">They are building up, of course, coming in with big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> and filling 1t up and soften up and build. </span><span class="sentence" id="1328">You go up the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and then when this was done, they put like a little layer of grass and put in sticks, metal sticks. </span><span class="sentence" id="1329">All that was maybe a mile was metal that was maybe two or three foot long, all over. </span><span class="sentence" id="1330">You couldn't pass by and then in the machinery on each side of the mountain of the and start putting in cement and there was machinery coming in with for other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1331">And we had to stay with and build all this, like stages, like <span class="DLF">steps</span> and push away the <span class="DLF">gate</span> then run down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1332">They started from the and they made the <span class="DLF">gates</span> from wood and, of course, they doing this and filled up the <span class="DLF">hill</span> and made the other up and build up and they build up maybe four or five foot <span class="DLF">ditch</span> , and they cover up the whole <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> with cement. </span><span class="sentence" id="1333">And then they came with the machinery and start digging up and move away the farther away and start digging in two or three foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="1334">It was very deep. </span><span class="sentence" id="1335">You could see down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1336">It was 74 like the 15-floor deep in the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> and they started filling up with cement again. </span><span class="sentence" id="1337">They made it I would say, the size of this <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1338">I would say about 40 foot thick, thick cement all around, fully up to the hill of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1339">And when they are doing it they made a downstair and made like <span class="DLF">corridors</span> , and you could walk in the cement and they came with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bulldozer</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1340">Later on they come bury the whole thing in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and from the <span class="NPIP">outside</span> stick out just the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> and all this cement was built up so heavy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1341">They put layers of grass and then when you looked at this, it look like a <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> , like a normal <span class="DLF">hill</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1342">Only sometimes we are were doing this type of work and we had the Jewish -- this was really like we have the Jewish system -- it was really the time people used to fall in the cement and never came out. </span><span class="sentence" id="1343">And I think hundreds of people buried. </span><span class="sentence" id="1344">Almost I fall 1n there but I was lucky this time again and wasn't working there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1345">And my father was falling a lot because the work was so hard and stinking in the night time, and from the cement and the powder and the water, and I can't even explain, and it was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1346">I can't even explain the way it was working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1347">It is like you see a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> with machines and not stopping, and it was going on and people dying. </span><span class="sentence" id="1348">The guards would say, give an 75 example, a hundred people from my group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1349">Two is missing all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1350">Every day was dead people there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1351">And there was the work we are doing there and when we had the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">mountain</span> down. </span><span class="sentence" id="1352">And this and they came to start from the beginning and came with machinery and dig out the <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and made another empty <span class="BUILDING">stadium</span> answer <span class="NPIP">inside</span> , like you see the dome where they play the football. </span><span class="sentence" id="1353">That's the way it looked <span class="NPIP">inside</span> from the ground. </span><span class="sentence" id="1354">But before this was going on there was work I had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1355">It was work we have to going on constant until the end of liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="1356">It was not completely finished. </span><span class="sentence" id="1357">I am giving the picture of the way this is building it, and I was working with my father there at this time. </span><span class="sentence" id="1358">And there was a German that was in charge of our group, but somehow I was away, say I was lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="1359">I was never lazy. </span><span class="sentence" id="1360">It just like the way I was, work. </span><span class="sentence" id="1361">But I was watching him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1362">He wasn't watching me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1363">It was survival and my brother not so watchful, always get a little and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1364">But in the time we were working there, we been through a lot of experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="1365">But to start with the experience that I will begin with is we were working there one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1366">I was going out to work and there was a I men, already a Jewish man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1367">He was putting together the groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="1368">There was a man, a 76 German, came out and said, who speaks good German? </span><span class="sentence" id="1369">I didn't speak so well German but I figure I raise my hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="1370">You speak German? </span><span class="sentence" id="1371">I got a job for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="1372">He said I should take this briefcase and come in there, and you going to have a job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1373">You going to be the fire. </span><span class="sentence" id="1374">You going to put fire in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> for the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="1375">They had maybe 15 little boxes and had three or four soldiers which can go <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and warm up the hands. </span><span class="sentence" id="1376">We work also in the wintertime there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1377">But doing this I felt a little bit free. </span><span class="sentence" id="1378">I could go and after bringing coals for the -- when I left my father and brother working on this <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> that they were working. </span><span class="sentence" id="1379">And one day my father came and they almost killed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1380">The same German that was nice, my father told -- he told my father, he told me to leave the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1381">Nothing like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="1382">Anyway, there was my father he was beaten up because I have left the <span class="NPIP">place</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1383">It was not his fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="1384">It was not my fault. </span><span class="sentence" id="1385">I lucky to get a better job. </span><span class="sentence" id="1386">In this job I was doing I was constantly going out and getting fire for the soldiers, putting in fire for the ovens for the soldiers are and just by doing this I had a little bit there was soldiers all around the <span class="REGION">area</span> , and nobody was in back of -- he says I use today. </span><span class="sentence" id="1387">Go and take a bag and fill up the bag with coal and go back 77 with the coal. </span><span class="sentence" id="1388">And meanwhile, I pass by the <span class="NPIP">place</span> they were building the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> and without a guard, and by doing this I was putting the fire in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ovens</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1389">There was a lot of Germans used to peeling potatos, of apple or something, and used to go into my pocket. </span><span class="sentence" id="1390">But I didn't have the heart to eat it, and I used to always feel like I have a duty to give the food to my father and my brother because I had it much easier than they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="1391">And this was going on for quite a while. </span><span class="sentence" id="1392">I was doing this type of work, but in the time this experience I had one day a German came to me come we me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1393">Take my briefcase case and come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1394">You come with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1395">They took me out and I was going maybe for a mile, and this time the war was coming close. </span><span class="sentence" id="1396"><span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Airplanes</span> were coming to bomb <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and this was the time of -- it was still a long time for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="1397">I thought it would never end. </span><span class="sentence" id="1398">But really the Americans were getting involved already and bombing <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1399">And this German, I was walking with him and all of a sudden these two <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> , these MIGS, it was two MIGS, MIGS or something, Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="1400">They came so low because it was so empty at the -- came down with machine, ta-ta-ta-ta-ta and on me and this German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1401">And he was a big German and I don't know, he had a big -- he was not maybe they had so many 78 titles but I don't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="1402">He was a big man too, and he was going to mail something. </span><span class="sentence" id="1403">He thought maybe I was going to -- I was going around and said to put the coals. </span><span class="sentence" id="1404">Now, you go with me and he said to go with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1405">I go with him and take this briefcase when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> came on us, there was no way. </span><span class="sentence" id="1406">There was a little <span class="ENV_FEATURES">tree</span> far away, but this was nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="1407">They were building -- they are building for to land for <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1408">And then he said to me, stay still. </span><span class="sentence" id="1409">And he just took his hat and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> go by and he took off his hat, and took off his hat. </span><span class="sentence" id="1410">He throw this on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> and lay on his back and head to the side. </span><span class="sentence" id="1411">And I thought he was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1412">He's dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1413">I really thought he was dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1414">But he was not dead, but then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> passed by. </span><span class="sentence" id="1415">He said he talked to me to stay straight. </span><span class="sentence" id="1416">You shouldn't move. </span><span class="sentence" id="1417">You can look up if you want to see the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1418">He was so smart, but <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplanes</span> came down again and they saw him laying down and they raised up and stopped shooting. </span><span class="sentence" id="1419">They raised up and they disappeared. </span><span class="sentence" id="1420">Then I stand up and I am smarter than them. </span><span class="sentence" id="1421">He noticed it was . </span><span class="sentence" id="1422">He could be dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="1423">He was lucky that he didn't get a bullet. </span><span class="sentence" id="1424">If he would be dead, I would not be alive either. </span><span class="sentence" id="1425">This was one was experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1426">However, I will tell another experience. </span><span class="sentence" id="1427">I was 79 walking around with another German soldier and he was from the Wehrmacht, and he walked over to me one day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1428">You thought I look like his brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1429">He was blonde with blue eyes, beautiful young man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1430">I see nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="1431">He was a good looking man and I looked up at him. </span><span class="sentence" id="1432">And he was so uniform -- he was not in SS. </span><span class="sentence" id="1433">he was from the Wehrmacht, from the soldier, and then <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="1434">I look like his brother and he was on duty and he was guiding the people. </span><span class="sentence" id="1435">They were walking and every group had a soldier to watch them, and everyone had a Meister soldier to watch them and there was a Meister, the people that give you the orders to every day. </span><span class="sentence" id="1436">I have duty. </span><span class="sentence" id="1437">I will give you a leave it and you pick it up, and this can't be a German. </span><span class="sentence" id="1438">Was a good person, a good man but this was one was going on for a while and then one day raid and this time we were walking there, and it was also full of the <span class="INT_SPACE">bunker</span> they are building. </span><span class="sentence" id="1439">A little farther away was like <span class="ENV_FEATURES">wood</span> and one of us was going to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> and it was muddy and you go in muck. </span><span class="sentence" id="1440">And I sat in this <span class="REGION">area</span> I looked for my father all the time and my brother. </span><span class="sentence" id="1441">And every time I had something in my pocket and bring it to them and they were working in this <span class="REGION">area</span> , and so bring it to them because they were working in this

<span class="REGION">area</span> and all of a sudden the the raid was there and everybody had to lay. </span><span class="sentence" id="1446">This good German was with this group. </span><span class="sentence" id="1447">I saw him before. </span><span class="sentence" id="1448">I didn't talk to him so often. </span><span class="sentence" id="1449">I looked like his brother. </span><span
