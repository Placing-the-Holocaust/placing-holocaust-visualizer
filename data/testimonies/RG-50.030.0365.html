<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Good morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  Good morning, Joan.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="2">QUESTION:  Can you tell us your name and the name that you were born with, because I know it is different than your name now, and when you were born and where?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="3">ANSWER:  I was born September 17, 1916, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">My name at that time was Bernard Fuchs, and I was born and raised in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> ; and until 1936, I went through the <span class="BUILDING">schools</span> and read the Nuremberg law, and it became too hard for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">I had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> because no Jews could study further.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="6">QUESTION:  Let's go back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Tell me about your family -- about your mother and your father and sister.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  My father and mother both came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="9">They had left <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> around when the war broke out, 1914 -- no before that -- 1913, they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Elsass-Lothringen</span> , which is part of <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> now and was at that time also. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">And there they lived until 1915 when they went to live in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="11">Father was a custom tailor, and he built up his own <span class="INT_SPACE">studio</span> and built up a wonderful clientele. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">He was really the number-one custom tailor in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="13">And my mother, may she rest in peace, died very young. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">She died already 1928, when I was 12 years old and is buried in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="15">My father remarried in 1932 and had another son in 1933 and -- when I had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , I went on hash'alah’ to be processed to go at that time <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">But my father got sick. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">He had a very serious operation, and he asked me to stay back and take care of his wife and son. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">So, this way, that is why I did not go to <span class="COUNTRY">Palestine</span> at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Then in 1938, there was a big Aktion’ by the Germans where they took all foreigners, that means stateless or not, of German nationality -- Jews- and collected them all in a <span class="BUILDING">concert hall</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , and -- where we stayed for a day and a night. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And then they took us in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle trains</span> to the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="21">QUESTION:  I'd like to go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">It must have been very difficult when your mother passed away at such a young age for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="24">QUESTION:  And when your father remarried, I gather you didn't stay at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> after that happened? ' </span><span class="sentence" id="25">It is unclear what the interviewee said, however, it sounds as if he said "hash'alah." </span><span class="sentence" id="26">The figurative meaning of "hash'alah" is "on loan" (Hebrew). * </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Any nonmilitary campaign with political, racial, or eugenic ends (German).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  No, I left <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And -- I could not stay at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I just couldn't live with her. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">It became impossible. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So, I had left when I was 14.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  And you lived alone?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  I lived alone, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">I lived with friends, with their parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">I rented a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> there. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And I earned money, and at that time I paid the rent there and lived until the Aktion started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="38">QUESTION:  But you remained close with your father and sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  Well, I had to, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">My sister got engaged to be married with a -- not a Jewish man -- but we liked him. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">He was a very nice man. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">He was a dress manufacturer, special designed dresses. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And so how far back do you want me to go now?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  You can certainly talk about this, sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  And when the Aktion started, as I mentioned, we were sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and when we came to the <span class="DLF">Polish border</span> , on one <span class="NPIP">side</span> we had the SS with the bayonets pointed at us, and on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> we had the Polish with bayonets pointed at us, and we were 1n no-man's land for 48 hours before some intervention the Poles opened the <span class="DLF">border</span> and let us into a very small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="46">The name is <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zbaszyn</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="47">There -- I was always an organizer -- so when we went there, there was no <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> because it was a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> and here we were about 2,000 people. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So we organized. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">I took a few young people and we put handkerchiefs around our arms, our sleeves, and then we went and cleaned out pig sties where the cattle was and also some <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> which were empty. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">So, there we took care of the old people and the sick people and the children; some children were born right there. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zbaszyn</span> until six weeks before the war broke out. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">In the meantime, a lot of people who had family in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> were released and they went to their people, and so my father also went back to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> because he had two brothers living there with their families and I stayed until the last 100 were liquidated in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zbaszyn</span> because it was just about six weeks before the war started. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Then I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> with -- myself with some people that I had befriended and then later to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> , I stayed until I think it was September 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> had already been closed the first of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">So, one evening a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> came with a man named David Gertler, and he came in where I lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> , because I had corresponded with my sister in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , so she knows where I was. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">And she had sent this man with an SS man in a private <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> to pick me up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czestochowa</span> and took me into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> to be reunited with my sister and father. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">I was not too long in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , just a few days, when I got a call from Rumkowski,’ an Elder of the Jews, for a long interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">And there he said, “I want you to take over the labor department because we have to register every Jew, every child in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> because we have to give them work.” </span><span class="sentence" id="60">For work we will get bread and we can live. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">So we registered --
QUESTION:  Let me ask you something. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">You're how old at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  At that time I was 24 years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  What was your sister -- your sister's name 1s?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Dora.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="66">QUESTION:  What was she doing?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="67">ANSWER:  She was the executive secretary of the Rumkowsk1.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  Did you know this when you were writing to her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">I knew it only when I came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="71">QUESTION:  Was it surprising to you that she sent an SS man to get you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  Yes, only then I realized why she could have done it because of her position. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">She was able to do that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">QUESTION:  Did it worry you when these people came to the <span class="DLF">door</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">ANSWER:  At first, yes, at first. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">But immediately when he told me who he is and what he came for, naturally I was relieved, and naturally I went with them to be reunited with my family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="77">QUESTION:  When you saw your family at first, did your sister explain to you about Rumkowski and tell you things about him so that when you met him you had some idea?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="78">ANSWER:  No, she just told me of what is going on and what has to be done because Rumkowski was in a position to deal with the Ghettoverwaltung,’ to tell them you give us material. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">We will manufacture it and in turn you give us food and whatever we need. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">> Mordechai Chaim Rumkowski (1877-1944); Chairman of the Judenrat in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz ghetto</span> . * "</span><span class="sentence" id="81">Ghetto Administration" which also oversaw the activities of the Judenrat (German).</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Let me ask you something in terms of reflecting back a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">When you were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> and the Nazis took over, you were in some sense fighting the Nazis, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  You remember the Maccabees?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  Correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  Can you explain what that organization was?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  It was an underground organization of students who, like me, had to leave the <span class="BUILDING">universities</span> , and we decided to make sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">We became, like in other words, terrorists and we got hold of explosives and we broke up -- we bombed their <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trains</span> , any transport of the SS people and stuff like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">So, we really gave them a hard time. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">And in 1936, I was arrested for the first time by the Gestapo for three weeks, interrogated every day, the same questions asked, but they could not have any proof or couldn't tell anything of what I had done, so they had to let me go. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">That was in 1936. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Then in '38, I mentioned to you already, I was sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Zbaszyn</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">QUESTION:  So, when you got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lédz</span> , what did you think the Germans were doing in the course of the war to these Jews, since you had already experienced the Nuremberg laws and kicked out of the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , and at least some violence against the Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="95">ANSWER:  Absolutely, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">When I came to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and I was told and I saw with my own eyes, of how the people have to live in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , and naturally I was right up in arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">I could not digest it that easily. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And when the Elders of the Jews called on me to head the department, and naturally I was pleased that I got to do something productive for the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , even though people today have said I worked with the Germans and helped them, which is naturally it's nonsense because if we would not have done what we did in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , in 1942, that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> would have been liquidated completely and no one would have survived. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">And thanks to Rumkowski, and thanks to his negotiation power he was able to convince the Germans, and actually the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz ghetto</span> became a model for all the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> in the other areas. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">So, three days and three nights we registered all the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="101">QUESTION:  How did you do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">ANSWER:  Well, I got a staff and I got an <span class="BUILDING">office</span> and people came day and night. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">There were hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people, and we were able to do it in three days and three nights and everybody who registered also got where to go, to what <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">So we delegated people directly into the various <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  So, Rumkowski sees you and tells you to head -- did you head this department by yourself at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  At that point, yes, I organized it myself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="107">QUESTION:  So, how long did it take you to figure out this organization after he had spoken to you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="108">ANSWER:  Well, I was given people to interview and I interviewed the people and whomever felt they could do the job I would tell them, yes, they were hired.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  So how many people were on your staff at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  At that time I couldn't tell you exactly. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">It was over 20. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">Between 20 and 30 people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="113">QUESTION:  Now, when you registered, did you have cards printed out so you could register people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="114">ANSWER:  Yes, we had books and later on we made big index cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">But people themselves, they got a piece of paper with where to go, where to report to, to what <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , and with this they were given 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">cards and cards to be able to get food, like food stamps, coupons for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">And this entitled them to a soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">There were various soups around the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> where the people who worked the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> were able to get a soup. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Some a little bit heavier, some a little bit lighter soups, as you can imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And as the time passed, I had, for instance, I took a very sick-looking person out of a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and delegated him to a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> while I took a healthy- looking guy from the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and put him into the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="121">So, with one signature of mine I made a friend and an enemy, which you can understand. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">The ones who worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> , they were sitting. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">They got a little bit more to eat than the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">So, this went on, then, until 1944 --
QUESTION:  Now you're moving too fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">When you're registering people, there are clearly some elderly people and there are kids who probably can't work.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="126">ANSWER:  They still got cards. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">They still were registered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="128">QUESTION:  And did they go with family members to certain <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> or would they stay in an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  They would register but they would not actually work because they couldn't work. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">They were unable to work, but if we would have left them without registration, without 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">cards, they would die for hunger because they wouldn't get any rations.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="132">QUESTION:  So, everybody is registered whether they are really working or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">ANSWER:  Yes, everybody had to be registered.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">QUESTION:  And when you came into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and you're registering there are almost 200,000 people, right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">QUESTION:  What is happening with <span class="BUILDING">housing</span> at this point? </span><span class="sentence" id="137">When you came in was everybody living where they're supposed to be living or are they moving around?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">ANSWER:  Well, they had since the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> was closed the first of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Naturally, all these people coming from the other side of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> had to be housed. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So, naturally, there wasn't enough housing available for every family. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">So you found in most cases that in one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> lived four families. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">In every <span class="NPIP">corner</span> a different family, OK, and the conditions naturally were unbearable to live, really, because there was no running water. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">There were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">toilets</span> in the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="144">People didn't have <span class="INT_SPACE">bathrooms</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="145">They would have to go to <span class="BUILDING">outhouses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="146">And they would have to go and pump the water from a pump and bring it up into the <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So, the conditions naturally as you can imagine was anything but human.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="148">QUESTION:  And were there a number of pumps in different parts of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  No, mostly in every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> they had some water supply, but it was like I said: no <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> and not every <span class="BUILDING">house</span> had running water.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="150">QUESTION:  Were you living with your father and your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="151">ANSWER:  Yes, in the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="152">QUESTION:  I gather that your father's second wife and child had left?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="153">ANSWER:  No, she had left in 1939 to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="154">She was a nurse by profession and she got a job in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> as a nurse, so she took off with her son and went to <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="155">QUESTION:  And had your father wanted to go and they didn't allow him to, or you don't know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">ANSWER:  She didn't get any papers for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">She got papers just for herself and her son, and father was very active in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> also being a custom tailor. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">He was always working and had also quite a few tailors working together and they made for these people, even for the people in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="159">He had to make their suits for them, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="160">QUESTION:  Once this big registration happened, with all these people, and all of the people are going to their particular <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> or <span class="BUILDING">work places</span> , what is then your job? </span><span class="sentence" id="161">What are your responsibilities once that happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="162">ANSWER:  Well --
QUESTION:  What would be a day?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  They were always going movements on. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">People had died from hunger. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">They had to be replaced. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">OK, so, there was always a lot of switching of personnel because you can imagine so many people and so many various <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> , so there was always something going on where the department of labor had to act accordingly, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">So, there was always something going on that kept us busy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  Were you meeting with Rumkowski regularly?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  Not regularly but often. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">He came to my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> or I was called upon for meetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">And -- oh, yes, frequently I saw Rumkowski, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="172">QUESTION:  What was your relationship like? </span><span class="sentence" id="173">What kinds of things would you discuss? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">Would it only be business or were you also discussing the situation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="175">ANSWER:  Well, if we were socially somewhere together, then yes, I would talk with him a little bit about various subjects and incidents which occurred which I wanted to know more details about. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">And also, about my background, what he wanted to know. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">But otherwise, he was very busy and there wasn't much time for socializing, except when we had concerts. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">We had our own orchestra, and so it was really a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> by itself in itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="179">QUESTION:  Was this a hard job for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="180">ANSWER:  It was not an easy job, and especially when the Aktion took place when they asked for 800 people or 1,000 people or 2,000 people to be sent out allegedly to other <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="181">I had no dealings with this because I left this to my partner, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czenszenski</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="182">QUESTION:  When did he come in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="183">ANSWER:  He came in about a year after I had the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> organized, and then later on when we got a transport from <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> there was also a gentleman who was told by the Eldest of the Jews, by Rumkowski, to work with me in the department of labor, especially for the Czech people. </span><span class="sentence" id="184">So, we had actually three at that time heading the department.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="185">QUESTION:  And who was the third?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="186">ANSWER:  Anders was his name. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">He came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Prague</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Terrific elements in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Professionals, very intelligent people but unfortunately they died like flies. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">They could not adjust themselves to the conditions of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="191">When they came into the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Marysin</span> , where we had our <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , they asked, "Where we can get a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">taxi</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="192">Is there a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> ?" </span><span class="sentence" id="193">As funny as it seems, but at that time, the tears came into my eyes when I saw these people and unfortunately we lost so many of them at that time very fast.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="194">QUESTION:  Now, you said that when -- the department of labor was somehow involved in the deportations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="195">ANSWER:  Well, naturally they were asked by Rumkowski to select certain people at random to be sent. </span><span class="sentence" id="196">The first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> for instance were the three Fs” in German: Fleisher,° Fuhrmann’...what was the third F? </span><span class="sentence" id="197">I don't even remember the third. </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Well, in any case these three groups, from three groups the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> , the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> went to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> and a lot of them survived, thank heaven, because they really went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">working camps</span> because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> came later on and naturally we didn't know that. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">We had no dealings with the outside world and there was no communication with the outside world...and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="200">QUESTION:  There was no underground radio?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  Yes, underground radio, I myself with a friend of mine, Dr. Smulovitcz, we had a radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">We listened to the radio at nighttime and we lost a very important person because of that- Doctor...Irene, she would remember the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">He was shot because he listened to the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">He was caught listening to the radio. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">That was a very dangerous thing to do but we did it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="206">QUESTION:  What did you learn when you were listening to the radio?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">ANSWER:  We learned about the war what was going on but naturally of what happened with us we did not being informed through the radio, we didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">Only much, much later we found some little paper in one of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cattle carts</span> that came back, that they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> -- “Oswiecim” it's called in Polish, and -- but it was a rumor but nobody really > The interviewee is probably referring to occupations, not surnames. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">° butcher (German). ’ </span><span class="sentence" id="210">carriage driver (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="211">had facts because nobody returned from there. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">But they, a lot of people survived even <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Birkenau</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  But the 1942 transports went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chelmno</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">ANSWER:  Which we did not know, I did not. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">As a matter of fact, some of the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> could write into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="216">We received mail into the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> from these various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="217">So, how we were supposed to know that they are going to their death? </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Nobody actually knew, nobody knew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="219">QUESTION:  And you think Rumkowski didn't know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="220">ANSWER:  I don't think he did because he heard the same rumors that we heard.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="221">QUESTION:  What was daily life like? </span><span class="sentence" id="222">What time did you get up in the morning and where did you eat? </span><span class="sentence" id="223">Did you eat at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="224">ANSWER:  Well, I finally got myself an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> and I found Irene in 1942. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">I engaged with her in 1942.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  Tell us about your meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  We had a date to meet at a friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  Why did you have this date?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="229">ANSWER:  That evening. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">And, well, I saw Irene when she walked on the <span class="DLF">street</span> , and I fell in love with her, just by seeing her the way she walked. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">And then when I saw her face, so it went with it. </span><span class="sentence" id="232">So, I said to one of my O.D.* men, who was always my lifeguard if you want to call it, I said to him, "I want to meet this girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">I want to meet this girl. </span><span class="sentence" id="234">You have to make a date for me." </span><span class="sentence" id="235">And it happened to be that I was at that time I had a slight cold or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">I was <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and -- no that was afterwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">So, finally we made a date and he made a date with her not telling her that she had a date with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">So, he made the date with her and it was late at night and she was an hour late and he still was there but he was just about going away when she came. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">And she came and the whole night she was sitting and talking and I was serenading her, playing on my violin and finally she fell in love with me, too. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">So, then one evening in November, the 11th of November to be exact, we had -- in a friend's <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , she was ready and I went to her parents and I asked for her * Ordnungs Dienst [Organization for public order" (German). </span><span class="sentence" id="241">hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">I want to marry their daughter and they allowed this. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">They said, “OK, you can marry our daughter.” </span><span class="sentence" id="244">Then I went to the party where we met for the evening and I said, “Congratulations we are engaged to be married.” </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And that was then the way I met Irene and then we married in June of 1943, by the Elders of the Jews, together with 18 or 19 other couples.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">QUESTION:  Did you life change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="247">ANSWER:  Since then? </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Well, to me in my eyes, yes, because she's a wonderful woman, very bright, very intelligent, and down to earth with a lot of common sense and a tremendous intuition. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">She knows things which happen later on, she knows beforehand. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">And so then I got an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> with a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and a <span class="INT_SPACE">kitchen</span> and I lived there with Irene then. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">And...so, I got up in the morning like seven o'clock, was at my <span class="BUILDING">office</span> at eight, and Irene was also working in one of the <span class="BUILDING">factories</span> and we lived there with the various happenings during this time in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> which is already known today by everybody who is interested in it because it's a matter of documentation already of what had happened in between '42 and '44. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">We have lost a lot of people by transporting them out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , by attrition, and as the time passed by more and more and more starved. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Of course sickness, hunger and in 1944 the last transport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> was the next to the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> , there was also was the Elders of the Jews, Rumkowski, and all his staff and his wife and his brother, and they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> and unfortunately, as we learned later on, he was immediately killed when he got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="254">And then we were the last transport out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> in '44 and we did not go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="256">QUESTION:  Let me go back and try to ask you some details.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  OK.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="258">QUESTION:  I know that it's difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Did people come to you and ask you for favors? </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I mean you were in a position to make decisions?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="261">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  So you must have been put in situations where people asked you to do things.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="264">QUESTION:  For them and other people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">QUESTION:  Can you talk about some of those kinds of difficulties?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">ANSWER:  I will not remember the details, but one thing was certain, that I did not take any bribes. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">Nobody could buy me, and I did it to the best of my ability and to my conscience. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">So, if somebody asked me a favor and I could do it I gladly did it, and if I couldn't, I couldn't. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I had to say no. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">But that I did really select someone to do a favor, no, I did not.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  There were some mass demonstrations and strikes early on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="274">QUESTION:  Did you have sympathy with these strikers or did you find them disruptive?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="275">ANSWER:  Well, these people did not know the background of why the happenings what happened so they tried, they thought by striking or by demonstrating they could better their lives by getting maybe more bread or more to eat, but it didn't do any good because Rumkowsk1 did the only thing he could do was what he did. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">All right, he was a little bit rough, but if you put yourself into his position, what could he have done? </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Like for instance, the transport when they asked for children, his heart was breaking, but what could he have done, because if he wouldn't have done it, it would have been worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">Because, for instance, a transport was supposed to go out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they could not fulfill the quota, they came in and blocked off, you know, two or three or four <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and took everybody that was found in there and sent them away. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">So, what was the lesser evil? </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Nothing could have been done.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  Do you remember that day when he gave that talk about “give me your children’’?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  No, I don't remember, and I wasn't there. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">I wasn't there and I did not take part in that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="284">QUESTION:  Did you hear him speak?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  No, no, I learned it when I saw the film. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">I knew that a transport had to go out, but I did not hear the speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">I wasn't present when he spoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="288">QUESTION:  Did you decide not to go or were you just doing something else?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="292">QUESTION:  You had police protection?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="293">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">QUESTION:  Two guards with you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">ANSWER:  Yes, well, they stayed in the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> to keep order because when there is a <span class="DLF">line</span> of people <span class="NPIP">outside</span> everybody wants to be the first. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Everybody tries to be -- so they kept order.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">QUESTION:  So, it wasn't to protect you, or was it as well?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="298">ANSWER:  The main reason was to keep order and then also to protect me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">QUESTION:  Were you in danger, do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="300">ANSWER:  Listen, in a <span class="NPIP">position</span> like I had, well, naturally people, as I mentioned to you before, with one signature I made a friend and an enemy at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">So, naturally, not that I was scared or something like this but everybody had to be careful because you never know what people do when they're desperate. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">So they kept order. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">Now, then, as I mentioned we were the last transport. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">Only 800 people were left in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> officially to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="305">We were sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="306">In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> , we were there for two weeks and then we were bought as slaves by a firm and we went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koenigswusterhausen</span> , where there were new <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> put for us and naturally also <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">straw mattresses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="307">We worked and made to cut certain wood and plywoods which we sent away to be assembled -- we didn’t do the assembly -- and we understand they were boxes sent to the <span class="REGION">eastern front</span> against <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="308">They would put certain ice-melting stuff in there, like some flame throwers or something like this, and thank heaven the war did not last two weeks longer because I probably would have been shot for sabotage because what I cut on the circular saw was a quarter of inch too long, a quarter of an inch too short. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">We dealt with centimeters. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">It was a half a centimeter less or half a centimeter larger, so, but it wouldn't fit together. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">So, thank heaven it ended when it ended because otherwise I probably would have been killed for sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">What else can I say, what else can I tell you? </span><span class="sentence" id="313">In the mean time I had other experiences, like my back was broken -- not broken but fractured, because one day I had to go into the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">forest</span> to build some tank traps and next to me was a man, an elderly man, who could not work. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">So I did something for him so one of the SS men who watched us came over and told him to work, and he was just leaning over his shovel and said, “I can't, I can't.” </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So, he hit him, and when he hit him I said I will work for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">I will do his part. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">So, he gave me over the back with his rifle and I had a slight fracture of L-2, as they call it in that language. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">And I was hiding for a while because I could not stand, but thank heaven it healed. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">And I needed an operation which was performed in 1966 and thank heaven everything is all right. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So any further details you would like to know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">QUESTION:  Yes, I want to go back to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="322">ANSWER:  Let’s go back.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="325">QUESTION:  Do you remember the name of it?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="341">QUESTION:  And what was the money used for?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Inside, people bought themselves cigarettes, hand made cigarettes, various things. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">It didn't have any value outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , it was only within the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="344">QUESTION:  Did this money have Rumkowskt's picture on it or some of the money?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="345">ANSWER:  Yes, oh, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="346">QUESTION:  What did you think of that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="347">ANSWER:  At that time it was absolutely natural for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">It was an organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">It was a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="355">QUESTION:  What kind of a hierarchy between people who came in richer and people who came in poorer and people who came in from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Czech transports</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German transports</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="356">Do you remember <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">gypsy transport</span> coming in?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="357">ANSWER:  I don't recall. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">We got a lot of transports coming from little <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">villages</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> around the vicinity of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , but I don't remember.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  Do you recall whether there was a difference in treatment with the people who were already in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> from the people who were coming in from <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> who might not, then had to get <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> or parts of <span class="INT_SPACE">apartments</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Do you think there was a distinction between those people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="361">ANSWER:  Well, I would say that some of them who were affected by the newcomers, as you want to call them, because they had to share a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> with them or whatever, so naturally they might take objection to it. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">But in general, everybody tried to help, actually, the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="363">QUESTION:  Was there sufficient -- I don't mean a lot of food -- but could every one get something to eat or was there a lot of starvation among certain groups, do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="364">ANSWER:  There was starvation, absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="365">QUESTION:  That must have been very difficult?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="366">ANSWER:  It was difficult. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">It was difficult because the bread ration which varied from time to time was too much to die but not enough to live. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">But eventually and slowly people starved, starved, and no resistance to sicknesses and a lot of people got tuberculosis and just died away. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So, it was very much decimated by people going on transport, being sent out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and by attrition, and died by starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">So, from the 200,000 people coming to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> , there were in 1944 maybe, maybe by estimation, I estimate maybe 30,000 or 40,000 people left. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">They either died away or were sent on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="372">QUESTION:  Was there a different kind of work for men than there was for women in terms of the division of labor you have there?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="481">ANSWER:  Well, it wasn't much of a career, but I started boxing when I was about 12 years old, and I started to get into the ring with my name on the poster. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I must have been 14 years old and I was a junior welter featherweight. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I started boxing when I was about 12 years old, started training. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">The <span class="BUILDING">Jewish sport club</span> <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bar-Kochba</span> had no boxing in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="485">We had no boxing, so I joined the Heros-Eintracht boxing club in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="486">And when I was about 14 I was ready to go into the ring. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">My name was on the poster and I started boxing as a junior featherweight and I did fairly well, and I was just about ready to go into the championship fights when I was paired against one who was not very friendly towards me because we went to the same <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and he was one of the first Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">When it came to a championship fight -- no, I'm sorry. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">I have to go back now. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">I got him into the ring and I fought him and I won. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">I won that fight. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Then about a year later, at that time the Nazis started already but I was still allowed to box in that <span class="BUILDING">club</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">I fought him the second time and he lost again. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Then I saw him for the first time in a SS uniform and when it came to that last fight I just could not hold back but, and I hit him with everything I had and I knocked him out, and he was the one who arrested me in 1938 to bring me in the <span class="BUILDING">concert hall</span> where we were sent away into no-man's land. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">So, that was my boxing career. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Then, naturally, I could not go any further because at that time the Nazis were in full swing and full force and a Jew could not any more be in any <span class="BUILDING">public place</span> for that reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">So, this was the boxing career to answer your question.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="588">ANSWER:  I think that my sister had many sleepless nights because she saw and knew more than anybody else what was going on <span class="NPIP">inside</span> and outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="589">And one time I remember they took Rumkowski outside the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and he didn't come back until the next day, so we had feared for the worst. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">But he came back and nobody every spoke of what had happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">Nobody even tried to guess of why he was taken away and why he was brought back. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">In my eyes, he was not the despot, the demigod, as people made him or said he was, because as I mention to anybody I talk if not Rumkowski, no matter what he did, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> would have liquidated in 1942, completely, without any resistance, without anybody I believe, without me being alive today.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="593">QUESTION:  Do you think Dora knew what had happened when he left and didn't come back overnight, your sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="594">ANSWER:  She might have. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">She never answered the question because that's another thing that people wanted to know, of what transpired. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">She would completely ignore the question, so I don't know if she knew or she didn't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="597">QUESTION:  Do you think she ever wanted to resign? </span><span class="sentence" id="598">Did she ever talk to you because she was so close to all of this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="599">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">She was so much involved that she never spoke with me about whether to resign or not to resign. </span><span class="sentence" id="601">She had three girls working with her in the <span class="BUILDING">executive office</span> and she worked there very, very hard, I know, long hours, and I'm sure it was nerve-racking for her, but she was quite a character.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="602">QUESTION:  Can you describe her?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">ANSWER:  How shall I describe her? </span><span class="sentence" id="604">Very bright, extremely intelligent, quick to the draw, down to earth, and a tremendous inside view of what is happening -- all the surroundings of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="605">She was quite a woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="606">QUESTION:  So you were close to each other?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="607">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="608">QUESTION:  Or not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="609">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="610">QUESTION:  Was she married in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> or was she single?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="611">ANSWER:  No, they married after the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="612">She married the brother of the second in command of Eric Yakobovitch. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">He was the vice president, if I can say so, and he was in charge of all the factories and he was a second in command. </span><span class="sentence" id="614">So, when Rumkowski was unable to do something, he was the one to enforce everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="615">He was the one to do it, and his brother married my sister after the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">QUESTION:  Did she ever say what it was like to work with Rumkowski? </span><span class="sentence" id="617">Was he easy to work with or difficult to work with?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">ANSWER:  We knew it was difficult to work for him. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">She didn't have to answer that because everybody knew it was a horrible job for anybody because as I said, he really took everything out of you especially when you were that close like she was to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">He was demanding. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">He was demanding, and he wanted you to do something you better do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="622">QUESTION:  Was he like this before?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="623">ANSWER:  I didn't know him before, but I know that he was a very charitable man and was always going around fundraising for his <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> which was very close to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">I was told, because I did not know him, naturally, from before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="625">QUESTION:  It seems to me that the picture of any human being 1s very complicated, so someone damning a person or completely praising someone may not be quite appropriate. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">Do you think there was anything negative -- I mean you've said very powerful things about him in terms of what you think he was able to do that wouldn't have happened without him. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">Do you think anything negatively about him?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="628">ANSWER:  Well, one thing is he lost his temper very easily... and then watch out. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">That's what I can say about him, and you had to do what he wanted. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">And very, very seldom did I do against what he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">If he said A and I wanted B, I went B. I was a hothead too, you know, but it never came really to a fight or something with him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="632">QUESTION:  So, you controlled yourself in spite of your rage?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="633">ANSWER:  I did, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">Today I can say, yes, I controlled myself, but he was redheaded -- a hot guy.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="635">QUESTION:  But he also had power, so that --
ANSWER:  Tremendous power. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">He had absolute control of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="637">He was the man.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="638">QUESTION:  So, that if he, if you went against him, he could get you deported?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="639">ANSWER:  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="640">QUESTION:  That's a bit frightening to be around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="641">ANSWER:  Well, you lived with either or. </span><span class="sentence" id="642">You could have had the same thing from the Germans because if they didn't like something they could have done the same thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">So it was not an easy situation all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">All right?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="645">QUESTION:  Do you think that these workers who had demonstrated these early mass demonstrations, many of them were sent in the early deportations?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="646">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="647">QUESTION:  Possibly because they had gone on strike?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">ANSWER:  Probably.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">QUESTION:  Had -- and probably Rumkowski wanted them out because they were trouble in terms of what he was trying to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">Do you think they might have been the core of resistance or is that just a stupid idea?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  Well, as I said, they tried to better themselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">They tried to get more food and they did not realize by the same token you have today's strikes which absolutely nonsense because what do they achieve? </span><span class="sentence" id="653">At that time it was even more ridiculous but they didn't realize that. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">They just tried and mobilize themselves and tried to better their condition. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">But naturally it was in vain because what could they do? </span><span class="sentence" id="656">What could Rumkowski have done? </span><span class="sentence" id="657">Just because they demonstrated, he could not go to the Germans and say I want more food for my people, all right, and whatever we had we had to work for. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">So even when I was interviewed by Ross (ph), at his interview with me, he said how do I feel today that I cooperated with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">I didn't cooperate with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">Just because we manufactured something the Germans could use, well, that was our livelihood. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">That was our bread. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">And a lot of people don't understand that. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">Okay, we made munitions parts. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">Okay we made something the German army could use, but did we have another choice? </span><span class="sentence" id="665">It was our work and our labor which saved us from complete starvation. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">What little we got but we got it because we worked for it, so there was no cooperation, you know, with the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">So that is a misunderstanding which still goes around in a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">But they don't think. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">They just go with the masses. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">Why? </span><span class="sentence" id="671">Can you imagine that after the all documentation you see in public television and whatever, the Holocaust - the American army when they went into these <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and made all these films of what they found and still people today can say denying that there was such a thing, that it is all propaganda. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">For what propaganda? </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Who won the war? </span><span class="sentence" id="674">The Germans and the Japanese. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">They didn't lose the war, they won it. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">The Marshall Plan lift them up until they are one of the biggest nations of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">Am I right or wrong?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="678">QUESTION:  Do you think that was a bad idea?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="679">ANSWER:  I don't know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="680">QUESTION:  Can you talk about the last few months when you think about 30,000 or 40,000 people left in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> before the last deportations or are there more than that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="681">ANSWER:  Well, it all depends on what timeframe are we talking. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">We're talking 1944. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">We're talking about the timeframe between January or February '44 to September, October. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">There might have been about 60,000 or 70,000 people left, and all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transports</span> took place at that timeframe. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">We were taking into the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and we stayed there to be transported out of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="686">A few days before Rumkowski and Rosenblat (ph), you know, the police chief and his brother and a lot of other dignitaries went with the transport to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Auschwitz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="687">We however, went, as I mentioned, to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> and then wound up in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Koenigswusterhausen</span> in that <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="688">And only about 800 people were left to liquidate the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> and they came out smelling like a rose because they found all these treasures which were left behind in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="689">So, they came out fairly well-off and today they are all set. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">More power to them because better them than the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">QUESTION:  So there's a group that's left to liquidate, to tidy up everything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="693">QUESTION:  And they can obviously accumulate because --
ANSWER:  Whatever they found they could hide for themselves and then <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was finished and then they had what they took. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">What they found they had for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="695">QUESTION:  Now you and your father and Dora goes with Irene and her mother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="696">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="697">QUESTION:  And David --
ANSWER:  David and her father and my father, we went together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="698">QUESTION:  All of you were together?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="699">ANSWER:  We were separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Sachsenhausen</span> and they went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbriick</span> , and then very late, it must have been, we were liberated on the 27th of April in '45 so that must have been in the beginning of '45 where a transport of women were sent where we were into another <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , separated from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">We had no contact and -- except when we went to labor, but I was in the <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> , so, but they worked <span class="NPIP">outside</span> with some men also. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">So in the evening they were separated again. </span><span class="sentence" id="703">And Eric Yakobovitch’s son, who lives now in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Florida</span> , he was at that time five years old or six years old and he came with his mother also. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">But Irene and my sister, they did not come with that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">They were left in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ravensbrtick</span> and they were liberated by the Russians, as we were also, in April. </span><span class="sentence" id="706">And just only maybe 50 or 60 women and children came where we were. </span><span class="sentence" id="707">The rest were left, yes, and we were liberated the 27th of April 1945 at 4:00 in the morning the Russians came. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">Before, I must tell you, a very bad thing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="709">We had also <span class="DLF">air raid trenches</span> , and every night the sirens, you know, they came during the night we were working and at day time they were bombing. </span><span class="sentence" id="710">So every time there was an air raid we had assigned places in these <span class="DLF">trenches</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="711">The first few alarms I went with my father and we went to the <span class="NPIP">place</span> where we were supposed to be, but then I said, "Papa, we are not going anymore." </span><span class="sentence" id="712">I was lying on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> under the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="713">On this end of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> my father was on the other end of the <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> and every time a bomb or grenade hit we called each other to make sure that we were okay because we had 66 shrapnel in our <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> , and where we were supposed to be there were four young brothers. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">They came originally from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Pabianice</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="715">They were in our <span class="NPIP">spot</span> where we were and a grenade hit them full blast and all four were wiped out. </span><span class="sentence" id="716">It would have happened to us if we would have been there. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">That's fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">That’s fate and that's kismet.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  Where was David?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="720">ANSWER:  David, he was taken -- oh, yeah, one day towards the end I was sent to the outside commando and when we came back that late afternoon, 70 men had been taken away from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp,</span> amongst them my father-in-law, may he rest in peace and my brother-in- law, may he rest in peace. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">They were taken together with the others. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">They were sent on a march by foot. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">They were supposed to go up to the <span class="REGION">North Sea</span> , put on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and as a final solution being bombed out and drowned. </span><span class="sentence" id="724">And my father-in-law, he was shot, after the war had ended already, the third of May. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">He couldn't walk anymore and they shot him. </span><span class="sentence" id="726">My brother-in-law was able to escape at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="727">So, that was the last few days. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">And I had my violin. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">That's all I took. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">Of course I had a few hidden items there. </span><span class="sentence" id="731">And I went with my father after the fourth or the fifth day after we were liberated because I said "Let's not go out because they're still shooting." </span><span class="sentence" id="732">And I went with the Russian commando to organize bread and meat and wurst and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="733">I warned people, "Don't overeat, take it easy," and sure enough a few people overate and got sick and blew themselves up. </span><span class="sentence" id="734">And I went with father and we went across a <span class="DLF">field</span> and there was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunk</span> and it was covered with blood and I could open it and I opened it up and there were money, German money, the Reichsmark, it must have been at least a million or more and I said to my father, "Papa, if this is here full of blood it's not worth anything because I feel that the Reichsmark will be nothing worth after the war and there will be new money." </span><span class="sentence" id="735">If I would have known that until 1948 these Reichsmarks were good and valid, I would have been a millionaire at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="736">I could have bought whole blocks of <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="737">I didn't even touch it. </span><span class="sentence" id="738">I didn't even touch one piece of paper money and I walked off with my fiddle. </span><span class="sentence" id="739">I went over to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elbe River</span> and there was a Russian commander and I wanted to go across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> because the Americans were on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="740">That's where I wanted to be. </span><span class="sentence" id="741">I didn't want to be with the Russians. </span><span class="sentence" id="742">So, I went to the commandant and asked him if I could go with the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">transport</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="743">They were French, French prisoners of war. </span><span class="sentence" id="744">They were allowed to cross the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Elbe River</span> the next morning and I went to the commandant and asked I would like to go with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="745">So, I go back to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="746">So he said, "You are a German, so you have to wait until the Germans can go." </span><span class="sentence" id="747">So we smuggled, my father and I smuggled ourselves into the group of French people and we made it to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry boat</span> and made it across the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="748">We went to the Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="749">I went to the commander there and I introduced ourselves -- what we are and where we are coming from -- and so he asked me a few questions, how is "father" in Hebrew, how is "mother" in Hebrew and, “What kind of brakhah" do you say over this?” </span><span class="sentence" id="750">And so I answered him so he knew that, yes, and since then the big love affair between them and us and they wanted to give us everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="751">I had to help him. </span><span class="sentence" id="752">I was as, as a, an interpreter for a few days until we could freely travel until everything was clear and before we would get the first papers to travel. </span><span class="sentence" id="753">So, once I was very eager to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="754">So the commander gave me a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> , papers I could go everywhere to get gas. </span><span class="sentence" id="755">They called it petrol at that time, and papers that I could travel and that I have * blessing (Hebrew.) </span><span class="sentence" id="756">legitimately this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeep</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="757">And so, I started driving and everywhere I asked for my wife, whether somebody has seen my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="758">And nobody knew. </span><span class="sentence" id="759">Nobody said anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="760">Then I finally came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hannover</span> , to my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , and I started working right away in the <span class="BUILDING">town hall</span> and registered all the people who were coming from the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camps</span> and I repatriated people like Poles to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and Czechs to Czech and I took them all with various passes to the various <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">border towns</span> and I left them there and I took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> because they were all from the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="761">In <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> all the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">buses</span> are run by the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="762">Everywhere I was I asked people, survivors whether they know or have heard of my wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="763">Then one girl, showed it to her, which she saw the picture of the dolly said Irene was bombed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="764">She's not alive anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="765">And later on Irene told me that she was told that I was bombed out. </span><span class="sentence" id="766">So, it took us ten months after the liberation that she found me back in my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="767">QUESTION:  Did you believe it when this woman told you that she was bombed out?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="768">ANSWER:  I didn't know. </span><span class="sentence" id="769">And, well, naturally I was, I was, I was very unhappy. </span><span class="sentence" id="770">You know, I could not get over it that easy until I saw her and then naturally you can imagine, OK, after ten months of not knowing whether she's alive or not and then we started our life back together and a year later we had our daughter, our first daughter, and then in '49 we finally immigrated to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="771">QUESTION:  Was there a problem with your name?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="772">ANSWER:  And we came here and the first dilemma was at the <span class="DLF">pier</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="773">I was the chief interpreter on board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and every time the <span class="BUILDING">office</span> was down below and every time I had to make the announcement on the <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> I had to go all the way up and down and up and down. </span><span class="sentence" id="774">It was quite strenuous, but this way I earned my trip over to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="775">I didn't feel like I get charity. </span><span class="sentence" id="776">We came to the <span class="DLF">pier</span> and I had to wait until the last man left the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and get them through the customs. </span><span class="sentence" id="777">Finally, we were the last. </span><span class="sentence" id="778">I had three big boxes, plywood boxes, big ones, and a total of 11 items of luggage so I had quite, I had all our belongings and a custom agent came and asked me to open up everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="779">I had three packers packing my <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunks</span> at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> before I left and here all by myself it was already about eight at night at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="780">Aviva, our daughter, got very sick on board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="781">She had 104 fever and she was at eight. </span><span class="sentence" id="782">Irene and the child was taken off board the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ship</span> and went to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="783">I didn't know what happened to my child. </span><span class="sentence" id="784">I didn't know where they were and here I was crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="785">It was November seven. </span><span class="sentence" id="786">It was a very raw day, misty, cold and I had to unpack and naturally they didn't find anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="787">Somebody who loves me showed them that I brought up a fortune and I didn't declare it, but everything I had there was on my declaration, OK? </span><span class="sentence" id="788">So, to make it short, I had to put everything back into the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trunk</span> , nail them down and here they took it away into storage and I went to look for my wife and my daughter and it was not before 10 at night in the <span class="BUILDING">Hotel Breslin</span> on <span class="DLF">Broadway</span> that I heard that my daughter is in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> on <span class="REGION">Metropolitan Island</span> at that time, the <span class="BUILDING">Metropolitan Hospital</span> , and I had 20 dollars in my pocket which went away the next day for the taxi fare to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="789">So, that same night I went to the <span class="DLF">waterfront</span> and I saw a sign "help wanted", and I went in there and the foreman was also of German descent so we spoke German so I got the job. </span><span class="sentence" id="790">What was the job? </span><span class="sentence" id="791">75 cents an hour cleaning the presses. </span><span class="sentence" id="792">It was a spare box folding <span class="BUILDING">box factory</span> on Tenth and -- I don't remember this, it was on 70th or <span class="DLF">80th street</span> somewhere -- in any case what was my job? </span><span class="sentence" id="793">To clean with kerosene the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">printing presses</span> and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cutting presses</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="794">Three months later I was an a sample maker. </span><span class="sentence" id="795">I made samples and I made one patent for them also, which was patented for which I got a dollar because it was made under their name and their time so I got a dollar for it and then six months later I took over the night shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="796">I was a superintendent for the night shift. </span><span class="sentence" id="797">I worked there another three months and every time I wanted a raise they said don't rush the seasons, don't rush the seasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="798">So, I quit and went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bulova</span> . “</span><span class="sentence" id="799">What I am?” “</span><span class="sentence" id="800">An engineer.” </span><span class="sentence" id="801">And I started up at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bulova</span> , a watch company, and they found out I had pyrotechnic experience so I went, I got clearance, secret clearance and I went on the missile program. </span><span class="sentence" id="802">It was a very interesting job I started there and I was with <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bulova</span> close to 11 years, over 10 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="803">Then I was involved in the correspondence with another outfit, Daystrom, who had to take a bid on a big program also in the <span class="DLF">missile field</span> , and they had heard of me because I had made myself a name already. </span><span class="sentence" id="804">So, they wanted me, and another firm, TRW, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> , they wanted me so I went for an interview and first to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Cleveland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="805">I spent the whole day and at that time we were in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scranton</span> , we lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Scranton</span> and then I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strattford</span> in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Avco</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="806">I spent a whole day being interviewed there and they made me an offer I could not refuse. </span><span class="sentence" id="807">So since my contract at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Daystrom</span> had a two year option that I felt I should not take, I went to work for <span class="BUILDING">Avco Lycoming</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Strattford</span> for 20 years, and I went up to, to become a director of a department with about 400 people.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="815">QUESTION:  Tell me, what happened to Aviva? </span><span class="sentence" id="816">She was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="817">We didn't --
ANSWER:  Aviva, thank <span class="NPIP">heaven</span> , she came through with it after eight days. </span><span class="sentence" id="818">We had papers to go to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="819">So we took Aviva when she was all right, we took her to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="820">We had to take a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> from somewhere down in <span class="REGION">Maryland</span> , I guess, to go across to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> , <span class="REGION">Cape May</span> , I guess, <span class="REGION">Cape May</span> it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="821">And we come to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Norfolk</span> and they received us there with open arms and brought us to an <span class="INT_SPACE">apartment</span> , and Irene and I felt like crying. </span><span class="sentence" id="822">That much dirt on the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> , a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">refrigerator</span> with a motor on top yet, you know, like 1850. </span><span class="sentence" id="823">And we looked at her, thanked her for it, and all night long Irene and I with the razor blades we're scraping the <span class="INT_SPACE">floor</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="824">The next morning, I met the people I should work with and I came back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I said, we really thanked them from the bottom of our hearts, but we don't stay here, this is not for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="825">We went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="826">QUESTION:  What about your name change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="827">ANSWER:  That was also when I asked for first papers, I was called to the <span class="BUILDING">Immigration Office</span> , and they started interrogating me for about three hours, maybe a hundred questions, and I said, "What is this all about?" </span><span class="sentence" id="828">I didn't sit down, they didn't ask me to sit down, I was standing. </span><span class="sentence" id="829">They interrogated me. </span><span class="sentence" id="830">Every week I was called. </span><span class="sentence" id="831">Every week I heard the same questions standing up. </span><span class="sentence" id="832">This went on for over a year, almost a year and a half. </span><span class="sentence" id="833">One day I come, "Mr. Fuchs, sit down." </span><span class="sentence" id="834">So I sat down. "</span><span class="sentence" id="835">Now we can tell you, you have good friends." </span><span class="sentence" id="836">I said, "What happened?" "</span><span class="sentence" id="837">They said that you were a Gestapo man, and that you have a lot of people on your conscious. </span><span class="sentence" id="838">But now we found out that it's not you. </span><span class="sentence" id="839">There was a Gestapo man with your name, Kommisar Fuchs.” </span><span class="sentence" id="840">He said, "They thought it's you. </span><span class="sentence" id="841">We give you the papers now, and we allow you to change your name through us so you don't have to go through <span class="BUILDING">court</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="842">So we were driving <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with Irene and she saw Rhonda Fleming on a <span class="BUILDING">movie house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="843">So she said, "Fleming, that's a good name, let's be Fleming, so we don't have to change our initials, Bernard Fuchs, Bert Fleming, it's the same initials." </span><span class="sentence" id="844">So that's the game by what we become Fleming.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="845">QUESTION:  Did you realize what they were questioning you about?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="846">ANSWER:  Yeah, well, they asked me what I did, where I was, what my duties were, and always they shook their heads, and always the same questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="847">Then I naturally I figured that somebody must have said something. </span><span class="sentence" id="848">But what? </span><span class="sentence" id="849">And they told me that they thought that I'm the Gestapo Fuchs.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="850">QUESTION:  Can you describe the situation that there was someone in <span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> who was also making accusations against --
ANSWER:  I was supposed to have a speech about my experience during the Holocaust in my <span class="BUILDING">Masonic Lodge</span> , and it was publicized that I will be speaking on this subject, and the Master of the <span class="BUILDING">Lodge</span> called me up and said, "Bert, we have to cancel you." </span><span class="sentence" id="851">There was some accusation made that about, probably, almost the same thing of what the other accusations were. </span><span class="sentence" id="852">When I heard this, I went to my Rabbi, Rabbi Stein, and I said, "Rabbi, this and this and this happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="853">This and this accusations were made, and I would like to take this woman for a deen Torah.’””'” </span><span class="sentence" id="854">That means for a rabbinical justice, a <span class="BUILDING">rabbinical court</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="855">So he investigated very thoroughly. </span><span class="sentence" id="856">He called Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="857">He called the organizations here of the former Lodge people. </span><span class="sentence" id="858">He finally came to the end result and told that woman, "You better keep your mouth shut, because he can sue you for everything you have." </span><span class="sentence" id="859">And he told me, "Bert, don't worry about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="860">Everything is fine."</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="861">QUESTION:  Did you know this woman?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="871">QUESTION:  What do the students ask you, when you talk to the young students? </span><span class="sentence" id="872">Do they have questions or --
ANSWER:  They ask a lot of questions, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="873">But I must say that they were almost mesmerized when I spoke to them. </span><span class="sentence" id="874">They followed every word, and afterwards they sent, every student sent me a nice little letter thanking me of and the impression they had and what they have learned, because I left them always a message.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="875">QUESTION:  And what was that message?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="876">ANSWER:  The message is: remember what we tell you, because we are dying out. </span><span class="sentence" id="877">So you have to tell your children; they have to tell their children of what happened, and make sure that it will never happen again. </span><span class="sentence" id="878">Have your ears and eyes wide open. </span><span class="sentence" id="879">Rot the weed out as soon as you see it. </span><span class="sentence" id="880">Any other things you would like to know? </span><span class="sentence" id="881">Did we cover it, all the <span class="REGION">territory</span> ? '</span><span class="sentence" id="882">° “Deen” means verdict or court decision (Hebrew); “Deen Torah” is a verdict based on the laws of a <span class="BUILDING">rabinnical court</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="883">QUESTION:  I think we covered a lot of <span class="REGION">territory</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="884">Is there anything you would like to add?</span></p>
