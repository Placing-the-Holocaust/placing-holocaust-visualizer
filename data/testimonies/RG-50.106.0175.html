<p><span class="sentence" id="7">QUESTION:  All right, let’s talk a little bit -- let’s talk a little bit about your family, who your parents were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="8">ANSWER:  Okay, my father, his name was Marek, in -- in engli -- in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> he would probably be called Mark. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">Marek Weingarten and my birth mom, her name was Ethel Birenbaum from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chelm</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="10">Once she married my father, she became Ethel Weingarten.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Ah, let -- let’s talk about your father’s background, what do you know about that? </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Where he was from?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  He was born also in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boryslaw</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in 1906. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">April 25", 1906, because my son was born 70 years down the <span class="DLF">road</span> , April 25", 1976. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">So I remember that. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">His background was, from what he told me, is that at one point as a child he was sent away to -- I don’t know if it was an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> or it was like a <span class="BUILDING">youth home</span> for children. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">And he stayed there for awhile, and I think he was also schooled in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And then he returned. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">He also told me that his ancestors, or his father, which is actually my grandfather, his father came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And in those days they made shidduchim, a shidduch, so he was matched up with my grandmother, who was from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and apparently from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boryslaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="21">So that’s how the famil -- th-the roots of the family came from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boryslaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="22">And my father became a craftsman, but the word -- what’s -- not a mechanic, but what is that called, the people who do <span class="DLF">fences</span> from metal.</span></p>

ANSWER:  I-I would say yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">Worked with iron and created all kinds of things. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And then s -- an-and -- and I think also my grandfather was involved in it, but after awhile he gave it up and he decided to assemble <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And he opened a little workshop for himself and he employed his younger brother and he also employed a young man in that workshop and that’s what they did, they assembled <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> and sold <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bicycles</span> because it -- in those years, that was the mean of transportation, or you had a horse and a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">carriage</span> , or you took the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="27">Not too many <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> were yet in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="28">But what he told me that his dream was, before the war, to import <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> into <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and develop this -- this -- this whole idea of transportation. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Well, unfortunately it didn’t work out, World War 2 broke out and those dreams were shattered. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">The other thing also, which I can mention it, he told me that he also was drafted into the Polish army and he served in the Polish army as a soldier.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  What years was that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="39">ANSWER:  No, he never mentioned that, no, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">But --
QUESTION:  Was he a religious man?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  He came from a religious background, but he was not a religious man at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">He just simply turned away from religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">He felt that religion separates people and that was his outlook on life.</span></p>

QUESTION:  Which means you were how old?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">ANSWER:  Oh, I wasn’t even a year old, so if we can add to ’41 -- go -- you know, go back. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So that must have been --

<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  And what do I know about her? </span><span class="sentence" id="52">From -- very little that whatever my father told me about her. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">She was a dressmaker and studied in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Vienna</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And apparently she was a very good one, very talented.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="66">ANSWER:  The name Anita, my father said he named me Anita because when he ended up in that <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> or <span class="BUILDING">boys’ dormitory</span> , whatever it was, or -- or -- you know, when you send -- it was, I guess, customary in Europe to send children sometimes to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> away from <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , and from what he told me that his family, financially it was difficult for them to raise four children, so they sent him away as a young kid. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And he said the woman that attended in that <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , her name was Anita and she was very kind and very nice and he said if ever he will have a child, and she will be a girl, he will name her Anita, and that’s how I got the name Anita.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="121">QUESTION:  Any memory --
ANSWER:  Well, I remember the journey, on a big <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">truck</span> that they came and picked me up with his new wife that my father remarried. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">I remember -- what I remember after the war, we ended up in a <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> , in a tall <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> , and I remember my father brought little Dominoes and we were building something with stacking up the Dominoes and if I’m not mistaken he lit a -- a match and he put like a match in between those Dominoes and somehow I have this image. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">Whether it really happened, that’s what, you know, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">But that’s what I remember, sitting in an <span class="BUILDING">apartment building</span> once I was apparently taken from the Christian family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="125">QUESTION:  Now, what was happening to your father and your birth mother in those years?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="129">ANSWER:  He stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boryslaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And what they did, they knew -- it was called aksia, like you know, on this and that day the Germans are coming and speaking to the Jewish authorities, the rabbis, whatever it is, we need so many Jewish workers for a certain project. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">Please make sure that on this and that date they all concentrate in the square, they are ready to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">We build a <span class="DLF">bridge</span> , or whatever it may be. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And my father was pretty clever, he realized that at that time already, you know, there were rumors that they are being sent, but they’re not being sent to build <span class="DLF">bridges</span> or whatever it 1s. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">So prior to that aksia he used to run away and escape from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Boryslaw</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">During the time -- I’m going back now -- he managed to hide my mother -- my birth mother and my grandmother with a Christian woman, and he paid her. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">And what he claimed was, she was hiding was in a <span class="DLF">hole</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> where they kept like potatoes and onions over the winter so it shouldn’t go rotten, you know, they didn’t have <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">fridges</span> in those days yet, so that’s where she sat with her mother, day after day after day. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">And unfortunately she contracted a --

<p><span class="sentence" id="142">QUESTION:  And your grandmother?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">ANSWER:  And unfortunately when she died in ’42, the Christian lady just chased my grandmother out, she said, I don’t want to keep this old lady, out. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">And she ended up in one of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and you know the end of it 1s, you know, death.</span></p>
