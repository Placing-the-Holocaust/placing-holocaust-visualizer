<p><span class="sentence" id="2">ANSWER:  We moved when I was about three years old, so I don’t remember much about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> , but I do remember it was mostly <span class="REGION">farmland</span> and they were just building the <span class="DLF">roads</span> , there was no <span class="DLF">thruway</span> or any of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">And then we moved about seven miles south, to a little <span class="NPIP">place</span> called <span class="BUILDING">Levin’s Mills</span> and that’s where I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and was brought up and graduated in ‘35 and that’s about tt.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  I think when I was in my senior year in <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">We didn’t have much choices in that time as to what you could do. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">Was a nurse or a secretary or a teacher. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">And I can remember a lecture that our professor gave and he said, “Do what you think you can do for the most people.” </span><span class="sentence" id="9">And I think that’s what decided me to be a nurse. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">No -- no special reason, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">July 15, 1998
QUESTION:  When did you go to <span class="BUILDING">nursing school</span> ?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="18">ANSWER:  I did general duty and I did private duty and in following years I worked with the visiting nurse association. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">I guess that was after I came back from service. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">That’s about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">General duty and private duty for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  And when -- and when and why did you decide to go in the service?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  Thad nothing to hold me at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">I knew that nurses were needed. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">I knew that I could be covered at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> by older nurses who had children and whatever and I didn’t see any reason why I shouldn’t go and I felt I could be of some help, I guess. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">That’s the only reason.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  You know other people that were going in?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="41">ANSWER:  Oh yes, but they were very strict, I think because you were 1n basic training. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">But enjoyed it really and -- enjoyed it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">QUESTION:  What other kinds of things do you -- do you remember from basic training?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="44">ANSWER:  Nothing much, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">I can’t remember that we went any <span class="NPIP">place</span> special. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">I can’t even remember what the meals were.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="47">QUESTION:  Must not have been too good, if you can’t remember.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Oh, let’s see, we had -- I was sent to <span class="REGION">South Carolina</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Well, I guess it was then that they told us that we were preparing to go overseas, because we had to learned how to July 15, 1998 <span class="BUILDING">pitch tents</span> and do all -- dig <span class="DLF">trenches</span> and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">And I think was about November maybe, they told us that we were going overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">And we -- I can’t remember what the date we got on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , but I remember we arrived December 22nd, in <span class="COUNTRY">Scotland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="55">And that’s about it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  Do you remember very much of the crossing? </span><span class="sentence" id="57">About the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , or what -- what it was like on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="58">ANSWER:  Yes, there was 19 of us in a <span class="INT_SPACE">stateroom</span> that normally held two people. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">I remember we were told that we might be -- the -- the Germans were hitting -- with <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">submarines</span> , might do damage to our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and we had to sleep one night fully dressed and with our helmets on, we were told that. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">Life on the Queen Elizabeth was just casual because everything certainly was different than it was 1n peacetime.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="61">QUESTION:  Was it crowded?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="62">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, mm-hm, very.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="69">QUESTION:  And when you were in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> then, you were treating men who were coming back from battle? </span><span class="sentence" id="70">July 15, 1998
ANSWER:  Yes, some, but mostly when -- they were patients right off the <span class="DLF">field</span> , because we were the first unit to get them right off the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="71">And we were treating some -- and sometimes we had to do temporary duty at other <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">QUESTION:  And what was your specific job? </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Were you in a <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> or in a <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="74">ANSWER:  I was in the <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> , anesthetist.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="75">QUESTION:  Anesthetist.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="82">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, mm-hm, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">In fact there were very few times that you would have -- well I -- maybe you were so busy that you didn’t, I don’t know, but you didn’t contact them at -- on the <span class="INT_SPACE">ward</span> after they left the <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> , as a rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">QUESTION:  What kind of anesthesia was used?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">ANSWER:  Retrous oxide and Sodium Pentothal. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">| can’t remember about ether. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">I think probably that was initially -- started a patient out maybe on ether, but didn’t give it to him for the full surgical operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">July 15, 1998
QUESTION:  Why was that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="89">ANSWER:  Well, cause it’s a little bit too heavy, I think, for a long operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Or else it was the doctor’s choice. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">I don't remember [inaudible]
QUESTION:  Mm. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">And it -- that -- was that the same job you always did? </span><span class="sentence" id="93">Did people rotate in and out of different jobs, or --
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">Prior to that, I had worked in <span class="BUILDING">hospitals</span> before we went overseas. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Like there was <span class="BUILDING">Halloran General</span> in -- in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Staten Island</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I was at <span class="BUILDING">Mason General</span> , which was a <span class="BUILDING">psychiatric hospital</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="97">No, anesthesia was only when I was overseas.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  And did you have special training for that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="99">ANSWER:  No, the -- the anesthetist taught me how to -- you know -- I had worked on the operating before, but not as an assess -- an anes-anesthesiast, when I working not -- not --

ANSWER:  You monitor the patient. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">I mean that’s a constant thing, you have to do that until a surgery’s over. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">And of course you’d go from one patient to the next -- I mean it was like, today, they schedule their -- your surgery and --

ANSWER:  No, a lot of them were repair surgeries. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Mine explosions and fractures. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">No, I wouldn’t call them -- I think maybe what you mean is you did the initial thing there and sent them on to a major general <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> , yes, that’s true, likely.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="114">QUESTION:  But they weren’t necessarily like an emergency room situation where you just --
ANSWER:  Well, yes and no. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">They’re emergencies because they have to be done right away, cause they’re right off the <span class="DLF">field</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Yes, I guess probably you would say they were emergencies, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="117">QUESTION:  Mm-hm, Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">But then they were sent to the <span class="INT_SPACE">wards</span> afterwards until they could be transported to a -- a major <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="120">QUESTION:  And what was it like when you were off duty? </span><span class="sentence" id="121">What kinds of things did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="122">July 15, 1998
ANSWER:  Just -- I guess walking, you’d play ball, you’d read. </span><span class="sentence" id="123">You’d do anything to pass your time away. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">I don’t think there was any specific thing and like I said, you made your own fun. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">Cause you naturally didn’t watch TV and listen to the radio and all that jazz. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">No, I just -- camaraderie I guess, with your roommates and --
QUESTION:  You all get along?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">ANSWER:  Oh, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">I -- I can’t remember ever having an argument with -- that’s why I said it’s a good training, a good learning.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well yes, but I’m -- even in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> you see when you’re -- when you’re in training to be a nurse, you’re pretty much in with a block of other nurses and you learn- course most of us knew how to get along with other people, but I think being in that close proximity, you are more aware of it, maybe. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">But you asked what we did, I don’t even know what we did, but the time went fast. </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And -- and we couldn’t be out by ourselves, you had to -- like when we were at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , or in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , you had to have an armed guard and there weren’t enough available because they were guarding the camps. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">So well, you didn’t get to see too much.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="133">QUESTION:  Did you mingle with the men at all very much?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="134">ANSWER:  Yes, we had parties for the enlisted men and -- and you’d go to the <span class="INT_SPACE">officer’s lounge</span> for either eating or having a drink or whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">Yeah, you mingled, not -- you know, not all the time, but yeah, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">July 15, 1998

<p><span class="sentence" id="140">ANSWER:  Yup. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">I remember that one. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">I think we might have left -- I think we might have gone in there -- I know at Easter time we were in -- in <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> or in <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> , one or the other. </span><span class="sentence" id="143">So it might have been May til ’'d say maybe sometime in July. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">So it wasn’t very long, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">ANSWER:  We were there for the liberation, we were there for -- well, they liberated the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and -- and that’s when our colonel said that we could go. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">We were left behind, all the boys went over to --

ANSWER:  No, we were already -- th-th-they went -- now where were we? </span><span class="sentence" id="156">I think we were like in <span class="REGION">Kern</span> and they left and went to <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">And -- no, there were still some there, because they couldn’t leave women alone in that <span class="REGION">area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="158">But they -- most of them left and liberated the -- I think I have a thing downstairs that tells about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">And our colonel said when he came back that he was not -- what’s the word? </span><span class="sentence" id="160">Forcing any -- any of the nurses to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">We could go if we wanted to and everybody but one elected to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">And course, when we got there, it was quite a sensation, but --
QUESTION:  Do you remember arriving?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:  Mm-hm, mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="164">QUESTION:  What was that like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="165">ANSWER:  Well, we all went up in <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trucks</span> of course and when we got there, there were patients intermingled. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Some of them were dead and some of them were still living. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">All on one <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="168">There might have been some <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> in there and I guess several maybe in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunk</span> , but I think the sad part was that some were alive and some were dead. </span><span class="sentence" id="169">And we had a fine chaplain who buried them, put crosses on every one -- in fact I have pictures of that too, downstairs. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">But that’s about it, I guess.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  And what did you do there? </span><span class="sentence" id="172">What was your assignment while you were there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">ANSWER:  That’s when I worked in the <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> and when we would get -- well, I just had to do what patients were there, what necessarily had to be done, but you’d also be getting patients from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> in the interim. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">I mean they were always coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">But July 15, 1998 we did do some work on some of the patients that were there as far as -- well, we called them patients, they were really prisoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="176">QUESTION:  Did you s -- did you set up your <span class="BUILDING">tent hospital</span> there, is that what you were working in?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="186">QUESTION:  W-Would have been hundreds or thousands or --
ANSWER:  Oh, hundreds, I’m sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">Thousands, no, I don’t think so, because a lot of them -- when I say a lot, some had just taken off. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">Heavens knows where they went, but they -- when they were liberated, they just went. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">But there were still a lot of them there. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">July 15, 1998
QUESTION:  And you would then, every day, go into the surgery -- into the <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> and that was your job?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  No, this was -- the fighting had stopped, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="202">QUESTION:  But people were still --
ANSWER:  Still coming in because those <span class="DLF">land mines</span> weren’t deactivated for a long time after, even after we left, I’m sure. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">So --
QUESTION:  And what about -- I’d heard that there were people in that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> who had been experimented on surgically by the Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="204">ANSWER:  I read that.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="205">QUESTION:  Did you see any of that? </span><span class="sentence" id="206">July 15, 1998
ANSWER:  No, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="207">QUESTION:  You never saw that? </span><span class="sentence" id="208">People like that --
ANSWER:  But I believe from what I read that that probably happened, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">I think too that the major one I read about was <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> and of course that was earlier than when we went over there, so [indecipherable] I read all that, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">But no -- not that I know whereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="211">QUESTION:  Did you get out and see much of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> itself?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="213">QUESTION:  Did you see -- for example, there was a <span class="DLF">quarry</span> there where a lot of prisoners were f
ANSWER:  Yeah, when we went to work, there was a long s -- <span class="DLF">line</span> of <span class="DLF">steps</span> or whatever in the <span class="DLF">quarry</span> and many mornings when we’d go, naturally, to have breakfast and whatever and then go to work, the Russians or the Germans had put a whole mess of stones in front, so they had to be removed before the nurses could walk up to get to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="214">QUESTION:  Uh-huh. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">So you had to go up those <span class="DLF">stairs</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="216">ANSWER:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="217">QUESTION:  Did you know at the time that that -- prisoners had been forced to walk up and down those <span class="DLF">stairs</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Did you know about that?</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="220">QUESTION:  Hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">And the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , did you see that? </span><span class="sentence" id="222">July 15, 1998
ANSWER:  We ah -- yes, we saw that. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">We did not see it in op -- I didn’t see it in operation. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">Before we atrived there, there was the stench of the <span class="BUILDING">crematorium</span> , which was sad. </span><span class="sentence" id="225">But as far as being in use when we were there, I never saw that. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">But I’m sure that it had been used.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="228">QUESTION:  Mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">Did you -- were you aware of local people in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> coming there for any reason to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> or to work or just to see it, or --
ANSWER:  No, not to be aware -- daily. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">They used to bring in a truckload of personnel that they would go and pick up off the <span class="DLF">street</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="231">QUESTION:  US Army would do that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">ANSWER:  Would do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">Local, I mean people from our <span class="REGION">working area</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="234">And many times the patients would recognize some of these people that were picked up as being SSers, abusive people -- which we weren’t aware of until this, you know, they started coming in. </span><span class="sentence" id="235">No, as far as viewers, I can’t ever remember people just coming to look around, but that -- that could happen, I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">But I don’t -- I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I wouldn’t think so at that stage of the game.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">QUESTION:  It’s pretty early.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="239">ANSWER:  Yeah, I don’t think there would have been people coming in just to view the <span class="REGION">area</span> , if you know --
QUESTION:  But you mentioned that some of the patients would recognize people and -- do you remember any -- any specific incident like that, when somebody said something or -- July 15, 1998
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I think probably I was told this, because I was not on the <span class="DLF">wards</span> and probably some of my nurse friends told me about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">No, I did -- I was -- I did not see this.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="242">QUESTION:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">You were in the <span class="INT_SPACE">operating room</span> all the time, right.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="244">ANSWER: <span class="INT_SPACE"> Operating room</span> , yeah, but --
QUESTION:  What about some of the people who -- the former inmates there who were well enough to walk around? </span><span class="sentence" id="245">Did you see those people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="246">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">They were skin and bones. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">Well, many, many days they would -- like when we went there, we s -- naturally fed them. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">There were two <span class="DLF">doors</span> to each one of those <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="250">They would come in one <span class="DLF">door</span> and go out the other <span class="DLF">door</span> , so they were really overfed. </span><span class="sentence" id="251">But they would take their food and bury it outside of the -- the <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> , because they thought some time that they might need it -- if there -- they didn’t know that they were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">They didn’t know too much. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">You could see in a week’s time how they improved and all that, but they really were mentally and physically -- I don’t know the word to describe it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="254">QUESTION:  But they would bury their food in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">ground</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">ANSWER:  Bury their food in hopes that one -- they could get out of there. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">I suppose they constantly had in their mind that they would -- were going to get out, you know, or would get out some way or another. </span><span class="sentence" id="257">And they would bury their food so that they would have something to take with them, until we finally got them educated, that they could have food every day and three times a day and that they didn’t have to do that, July 15, 1998 that they were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">But here again, where could they go? </span><span class="sentence" id="259">They had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go, really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="260">QUESTION:  Did you know at the time where those people were or who they were? </span><span class="sentence" id="261">Did you know if they were Jewish people or not?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">ANSWER:  Mm-mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">QUESTION:  Did you know anything about them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="264">ANSWER:  Mm-mm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="265">QUESTION:  Did you learn, after time went by?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="266">ANSWER:  No, I’m sure that whatever records -- and they did have some records, I’m sure that others could tell you about this, like Colonel Case was our chaplain and he did a lot of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">Maybe a lot of the nurses that worked on the <span class="INT_SPACE">wards</span> could tell you this, because they certainly got what information they could from them. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">And names and numbers, if they had any numbers. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">But I’m sure a lot of them didn’t even have names or numbers and probably couldn’t remember. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I know that there were -- I think more Polish, maybe they were Polish Jewish, I don’t know, than there were actually just Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">You see, this was quite awhile after the Holocaust, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">The Holocaust started in what, ‘42°? ‘</span><span class="sentence" id="273">43? </span><span class="sentence" id="274">And we were there in early ‘45. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So a lot of this happened before we even arrived, I’m sure -- having watched the movie.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="276">QUESTION:  You learn about it afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="277">ANSWER:  Yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">July 15, 1998
QUESTION:  When -- when did you get out of the service, do you remember?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="279">ANSWER:  October °45, I had a separation. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">That was -- yeah, 1940 -- October °45, in -- some time in ‘51 I was recalled.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="281">QUESTION:  Really?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="282">ANSWER:  Because I didn’t realize that when you were separated, that you were supposed to take two weeks training every year or they could recall you. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">Which they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">Cause at that time it was maybe --
QUESTION:  What is a separation, I don’t -- I don’t know the word separation?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="285">ANSWER:  You were just separated -- nobody -- at the time I got out, nobody actually had a so- called discharge. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">Everybody was just separated. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">You got your discharge later, but -- and I think at one time there was a choice too, as to whether you were discharged or just separated and I think, for some reason, I chose not to be discharged. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">And I think that I did this because -- thinking of retirement. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Well, I was uneducated and in order to- to do this, you had to spend two weeks training a year, which I didn’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">So they recalled me, to make up I suppose for the time that I should have spent or I say should have, I -- yeah, I guess it would be. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">So -- and at that time, I was married, but I was stationed at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Massachu</span> -- in <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> and eventually I got transferred to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Fort Drum</span> , which is very -- 10 miles within my <span class="BUILDING">home</span> , I could live at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> except when I was on call in the OR and that was probably two or three nights a week that I had to stay on call. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">And the rest of the time I could live at <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I had it made. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">July 15, 1998
QUESTION:  That was pretty nice.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="294">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="295">QUESTION:  Yeah, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="296">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="297">QUESTION:  Well, it’s been 50 years, that’s a long time and it’s ha -- I know that memories fade, but what sticks with you about that service that you did? </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Especially at -- at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gusen</span> , at that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="299">ANSWER:  I think it was very important and I’m not sorry a bit that we went or that I went, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">I think it was necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">I think it was good experience, a good training. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">I think that I did a part to help. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">I guess that’s it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="304">QUESTION:  And how do you think you’ re different as -- for having witnessed what you witnessed?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="305">ANSWER:  I don’t think I’m any different than a lot of people. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">I don’t understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I don’t understand how it could be done. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I don’t understand a lot of things that are going on today, like in <span class="COUNTRY">Bosnia</span> and wherever. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">I cannot believe that some one man could be so cruel as Mr. Hitler. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">But that’s the way it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">There will always be wars, there will always be people like him. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">So, I don’t know -- you say, how different? </span><span class="sentence" id="313">I guess I was more educated in that <span class="DLF">line</span> and that’s about all. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">I just never gave it any thought before and I still just can’t believe that those things happened, but they did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="315">QUESTION:  You never gave it any thought, what do you mean? </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Be-Before what? </span><span class="sentence" id="317">July 15, 1998
ANSWER:  Before I went in the service, I never -- I guess I probably was aware of it reading the papers, but never -- maybe then I just didn’t believe it. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">I don’t know, I don’t know. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">Never as aware as I was when I was there and witnessed what we did.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="320">QUESTION:  Since that time, have you had people -- have you been in conversations with people who don’t believe that 1t happened?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="321">ANSWER:  No, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">In fact my niece did a theme when she was a senior and at that time there had been a lot of news in the paper about people not believing it happened and she had cut some of those out and sent them to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">But no, I’ve not talked with anybody who said it couldn’t have happened, no. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">I think everybody felt that it was true and maybe not to the severity of it, but they -- because I don’t think you could believe it until you saw it, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">Except if you had family or whatever, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">Then it’s -- would be a different story.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="327">QUESTION:  Mm-hm.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">ANSWER:  But --
