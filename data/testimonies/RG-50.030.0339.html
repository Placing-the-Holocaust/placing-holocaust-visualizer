<p><span class="sentence" id="0">QUESTION:  Joseph, as we begin talking about the period after the liberation, I just want to make sure that we covered everything that you wanted to before.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="1">ANSWER:  There was one episode that I meant to cite and I will do it now. </span><span class="sentence" id="2">In those first few days of September of 1942, when the mass deportation started, my mother had been taken away. </span><span class="sentence" id="3">My father and my sister had to leave our <span class="BUILDING">dwelling</span> because the Germans who were shrinking and shrinking the size of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="4">It was hot. </span><span class="sentence" id="5">It was summer and there was no <span class="DLF">roof</span> over their head anymore so we lived in the <span class="DLF">street</span> for about three days and three nights on the <span class="DLF">pavement</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="6">When I finally obtained my father's permission to leave him for a few minutes because I wanted to look up my buddies from the resistance movement, something which he opposed for two or three hours, because he didn't want to lose sight of me in case we don't find each other again or that one of us will be swept up by yet another Razzia. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">I, walking down the <span class="DLF">street</span> , I ran into one of the two fellows who a year and a half before recruited me for the resistance movement Hashomer Hatzair. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">This was Richard, we called him Rishak. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">He had the look of an insane person rushing about, and I asked him well where are the leaders and where is our <span class="INT_SPACE">cell</span> and he finally gave me an address where I could find our company commander, a girl about 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">The word being Gdud, and when I asked him where Simon was, the taller of us three who also with him recruited me into the resistance movement, he told me that several days before the two of them were caught by the curfew. </span><span class="sentence" id="11">They had managed to work their way homesby a few minutes. </span><span class="sentence" id="12">The <span class="DLF">streets</span> were deserted. </span><span class="sentence" id="13">The punishment for violating the curfew was often instant execution in the <span class="DLF">street</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="14">So, the two of them darted into a store front and were flat against the <span class="DLF">wall</span> when the German gendarme went by. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">German gendarme, who paroled the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghetto</span> most of the time in addition to the SS who used to come in for forays, for selection, but mainly after 9:00 in the evening it was the gendarmes, you might call it the military policemen. </span><span class="sentence" id="16">They discovered them and as Richie had time to tell me in those few words with the commotion in the <span class="DLF">street</span> and throngs of hundreds of people milling about not knowing where to go what to do with themselves, waiting yet another selection. </span><span class="sentence" id="17">He said when the German gendarme approached them and asked them what they were doing in German, the gendarme turned to the taller Simon who was always the more combative one, the more bellicose one of us three. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">He always felt that when the time comes, the sooner the better that we should fight with whatever we had at our disposal. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">The German gendarme turned to him and called him "Du verfluchter Juedischer Schwein_, which means you Goddamn Jewish pig. </span><span class="sentence" id="20">Richard said Simon shot back and said you Goddamn German pig, at which point the gendarme shot him between the eyes. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">That's how we lost our closest friend, and at that point Richard, with his half insane look on his face said I got to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">I got to look for my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">I don't know where my father is. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So, I went back to join my father and my sister in the <span class="DLF">street</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="25">QUESTION:  Let me ask you one question. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">The years after that when hiding you were a catholic boy when you converted, did you have any information or contact with Jewish people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">ANSWER:  Since I jumped out of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> on the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Treblinka</span> in the first few days of September of '42, other than sneaking into two more <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ghettos</span> , in the provincial small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">towns</span> , which lasted a few weeks before the deportations there started also. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">Once I was on my own again, and later with the priest and working for the Polish peasants, as of November '43 going to <span class="REGION">east Prussia</span> with new Polish documents and Polish catholic until the end of the war, I had absolutely no contact with the Jewish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">I had no idea what became of them except that common talk had it that they were all either having been exterminated or they're in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> , and that there is a countrywide hunt for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I did not know about the <span class="BUILDING">crematoria</span> obviously at that point, but I had the foreboding based on tidbits that they're either all exterminated or about to be exterminated.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="31">QUESTION:  What about
ANSWER:  There was no time to stop and think and deliberate as to what it feels like. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">The entire focus second by second, minute by minute, day by day was on self preservation and that meant watching my facial expressions, my 13:08:13 gesticulations, my "true story" where I came from, my identity obviously changed as to my background, my schooling, who my parents were, watching my speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">Because one could give one self away with one word. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">Even though we were quite Polanized, coming from a certain <span class="NPIP">environment</span> one accrues a lexicon of words that one doesn't even think about. </span><span class="sentence" id="35">Whether one be an Irishman or a Jew or an Italian, every now and then you use a certain word which under normal circumstances it is accepted and is part of the mosaic of life especially when there are some minorities in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="36">You don't think of that, but when you try to play another role as it were and pose for someone else, one could give one's self away with a word. </span><span class="sentence" id="37">I'll never forget by the time I got to <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> and my German was already so-so because of exposure and because of my childhood where my father taught me a little bit German and I was speaking German passably and I'll never forget when I spoke to a German and I used the word for bread Broit. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">Broit is the Yiddish, Brot is the German. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">Well, inadvertently trying to acquire as much German as I could in order to speak to the Germans, I used that word Broit and the German looked at me and corrected me and said it's not Broit, it's Brot. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">And I said yes, of course, but I almost collapsed within me because I felt that I would give myself away with that one word. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Fortunately the German was not aware of that, but one had to be on a constant alert every second of the day first speaking to the Polish population for whom out in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> I was the "educated city boy." </span><span class="sentence" id="42">So, when they commented how good my Polish is, well he's from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="43">But also with the priest, Father Farkowski we had a number of sessions where he would pluck out a word from my daily 13:12: lingo and then coach me not to use this word, not to use that word, and taught me a new melody of speech. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">In other words, a pygmaleon, he was remaking me right down to how to hold my lips together because he felt that Jews by and large were more sensuous people and their lips were by and large thicker. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">Many Poles so he felt had a thinner line of lips, so then he coached me that when I'm not actually speaking to hold my lips together like this. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">In order to project a thinner lip line. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">So, I was -- ever since those days when he started remaking my identity as it were, for years and years after the war as I see it now, I have been groomed to play a role, and that lasted for years and years after the war, until not too long ago, maybe ten or fifteen years ago when I began to search for what is my own self.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">QUESTION:  I want to get to that a little bit later. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">Let's pick up from when you were liberated. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">If you can remember that for me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="51">ANSWER:  Well, the day after the liberation by the American troops and this was Patton's third army in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thuringen</span> , which I was liberated the day after President Roosevelt died, which I believe was April 13, 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">A couple of the Polish fellows with whom I lived courtesy of my boss, where he found a small <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for five, six of us Polish civilian workers so we would not have to stay in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camp</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="53">One of the two Polish fellows said to me to go to the main <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> , because that's where there were a lot of Americans. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">So, we walked over there maybe a half an hour or so, and there across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the main <span class="BUILDING">railroad station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> , there were a lot of G.I.s. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">In front of the <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> across the <span class="DLF">street</span> from the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> there was a lot of movement of G.I.s so obviously it's hard to describe how it felt. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">A mixture of enthusiasm that one actually not fully believed yet that this was liberation, but it must have been because there were American soldiers all around. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">It was warm and many of the soldiers were in a very friendly mood so I trying to invoke my English of which I had had two years in the underground high school courses in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> , and I knew a fair amount of English because I liked the language from the beginning more so than French and I started conversing with the American soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">One word led to the other and they give us as usually after liberation -- skip it. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">They give us chocolate and cigarettes and things of that nature and we were very grateful and they said to come back in the evening and they'll have something more for us to eat. </span><span class="sentence" id="60">When I went back there the second day, one of the soldiers introduced me to a first lieutenant Preston. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">That lieutenant asked me, he looked like by the way one of the British stars, David Niven, with the moustache, slim, tall very presentable, asked me whether I knew German. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">I said Yes, Ido. </span><span class="sentence" id="63">Do I know Polish, yes of course, I'm Polish, I know some Russian. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">He said come on in and help us interpret because they've had a number of refugees and foreign nationals and also Germans whom they were interrogating apparently. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">So, I studied interpreting. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">I was then 17, for the American G.I.s. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">He asked me to come back the next day and after some two or three days, they gave me a shirt and the trousers of a G.I. uniform without an insignia so that within three or four days after the liberation I was already dressed as an American soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">My job there was ostensibly as an interpreter and all around helper. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">I suppose some people call guys like me in those days a mascot or just a kid who fell in with the American troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">Within about a week later after I helped interpret for a huge number of displaced persons, Poles, Ukrainians, Russians, goodness knows who else who would stop by that <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> simply because the Americans were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">Help me with this and help me with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">It was a whole movement of nations. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">Occasionally, they would bring in Germans and as I found out later some got pretty rough treatment. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">They were moving out. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">This American unit and they asked me if I wanted to go with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Well, you might as well of put me on the moon of my dreams because of course I would want to go with them. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">By that time I was eating with them and the food was out of this world compared with the war time diet. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">There was candy and cigarettes and everything else. </span><span class="sentence" id="79">It wasn't until a few weeks later when my English started getting better and so on that I found out what that unit what. </span><span class="sentence" id="80">To me they were just American soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">They were CIC. </span><span class="sentence" id="82">Counter Intelligence Corp of the United States Army, and as it turned out this was detachment 220 of the 20th Corp which was part of the 3rd Army, Patton's. </span><span class="sentence" id="83">So, I traveled with that unit. </span><span class="sentence" id="84">There were at the most ten of them in that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">detachment</span> headed by Major Lobb who I was told by one of the CIC men a New Yorker or a Jewish fellow said that son of a gun, he was the judge who once found me guilty when I had a traffic ticket in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="85">Major Loeb who was a prince of a fellow in contrast with one of his lieutenants who within I would say two weeks or so made approaches to me, homosexual approaches that I frankly didn't know how to cope with. </span><span class="sentence" id="86">In the best English I could offer him when he came into my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the evening, because wherever we went they commandeered the <span class="BUILDING">German hotel</span> , I told him I was a catholic and as best as I could that we don't do things like these. </span><span class="sentence" id="87">Because up until that time I had never had any sexual encounter at age 17 since during the war in <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> at age 15 or 16 there were simply no girls or women to be with. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">A foreign national, Pole or any other non-German was under severe penalty to have any intimate relationships with a German girl, which was unthinkable. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Some who had and found a German girl I suppose consenting were taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> or severely beaten by the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">That was to preserve the purity of the German race. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">So, I had had absolutely no experience with a man or a woman. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">Within a few days after I was liberated and I was with these American G.I.s in a <span class="BUILDING">hotel</span> 13:22:30 where they were stationed. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">One of them asked me if I could play piano and I said yes a little bit and I sat down to play piano. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">I had short pants. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">It was April and he sidled up to me and he put his hand inside my pants and started fondling me as I was playing piano. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">This was a few days after liberation. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">That was before I found out that they were CIC. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">To me they were just normal American soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Within a couple of weeks two of them had made advances to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">That was part of my exposure to my great liberators and it wasn't until years, years later when I had gone to <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> and acquired a little bit more street wisdom and exposure to the world that I learned that as the saying goes the intelligence community not to mention the diplomatic community is disportionately staffed by homosexuals. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">My experience in the American counter intelligence, that's the people who liberated me within two weeks two of them had made advances vis-a-vis me and I was 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">As we drove with my liberators -- and the advances stopped by the way soon enough because I had made it clear that I didn't want them. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">The CIC detachment followed the front line troops throughout <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Bavaria</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> almost to reach <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Linz</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="104">As soon as the American troops occupied a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , the CIC was there within hours and sometimes even ahead of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="105">Once we were caught in the cross fire because we had marching orders to reach the next <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and it turned out that that had not yet been freed by front line troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">Wherever we reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> and it went - - we had 13:25: gone through <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> and a number of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">southern German cities</span> and into <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , and I remember we were stationed for a while in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Ried</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Innkreis</span> meaning the district of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Inn</span> and the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> was Reid. </span><span class="sentence" id="107">As soon as we reached the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">town</span> that was liberated, we had four or five <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jeeps</span> and in teams of two we had addresses to pluck out the Nazis who had been on the list. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">So, this was basically the job of the CIC, that was to arrest the more prominent Nazis, and I interpreted when I could. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">I have not seen any bad treatment except one that who was detached from the first French army, a native Alsatian Frenchman who despised the Germans and whenever he was interrogating them he beat them up very badly. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">Since I didn't have to interpret I never wanted to be part of that but I would hear from another <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and he would break <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">chairs</span> over their heads and so on and a number of the Hitler Jugend or the SS men caught were beaten up pretty badly when they didn't want to answer questions. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Eventually, by the time that our unit was commandeered back into <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , the CIC unit I believe was being transferred or sent <span class="BUILDING">home</span> so that I was taken by one of the officers to an MP unit, Military Police, and that was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , with the recommendation that the MPs could use an interpreter. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">By that time, my English became 14:02: more proficient. </span><span class="sentence" id="113">I was with that unit of the MPs being <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> and fed and of course living with them and having a GI uniform without insignia, for many weeks. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">This was when I gradually emboldened by my liberation began to confide in one or two soldiers about my true background. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">That I was Polish but I was also Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="116">Although by and large the GIs and MPs with whom I was living and working were a magnificent lot of young people. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">They were mostly draftees. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">They couldn't wait to count their points to be repatriated and to be released from the army. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">To them I was a kid, 17 and Polish and anxious to help them and grateful. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">They treated me magnificently. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">But, as the word got out that I was also Jewish, I started experiencing a few incidents of anti- semitism.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  It was a noticeable change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  Significantly, I remember standing in <span class="DLF">line</span> for chow, the 14:04: army meal, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> where we were quartered. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">One MP sergeant with whom I only had a passing acquaintance was in the <span class="DLF">line</span> nearby and he started calling me the Jew boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">As it turned out he was of Polish ethnic background from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Chicago</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="126">Then, a time came soon after when I was ordered to undergo house arrest. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">The lieutenant Dempsey I remember his name a strapping, huge giant of a man from <span class="REGION">Kentucky</span> who behaved towards me like an older brother with no hint of homosexuality whatsoever, always protected me and liked me. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">He told me that the major of the MPs, the provost marshall of that division, didn't like Jews and ordered me house arrest for me. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">Lieutenant Dempsey the southerner who loathed negroes, blacks, so much so that whenever I went out on the inspection tou throughout the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , as an MP, an officer of the MPs, he was checking IDs and whether they had a pass, and whenever he met up with black soldiers, he treated them abominably,sometimes would lock them up. </span><span class="sentence" id="130">I asked him why he would he do that and he said because I hate the blacks because they are garbage and they are the scum of humanity, and I said but Lieutenant, as much as I was able to express myself, but isn't <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for all? </span><span class="sentence" id="131">This was my dream of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , equality, justice from <span class="NPIP">outside</span> looking in. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">He said, yes, except for the blacks. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">And strangely enough, this was an MP lieutenant who was magnificent toward me even though he already began to find out that I was of Jewish background. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">But his superior officer, Major, also from the deep south, hated the Jews, and after a while, when Lieutenant Dempsey come sneaking into my <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> and bringing me something to eat, and I even needed permission to go the <span class="INT_SPACE">bathroom</span> , because the major the provost marshall put me in a house arrest for as long as he would deliberate what to do with me next.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="135">QUESTION:  What was the basis for house arrest?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="136">ANSWER:  That he didn't want a Jew boy to be an interpreter any more and he was trying to make up his mind what to do with me next, and Lieutenant Dempsy would come in an sharing his outrage but saying this was his superior officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">I can't 14:07:30 do anything about. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">And strangely enough, a man who became a friend of mine for years later in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , an attorney in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Watertown</span> , <span class="REGION">Massachusetts</span> , an Irish man, John Corbot, who befriended me also because he was one of the MPs. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">Strangely enough, he looked me up later when I was in the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and would bring me things to the <span class="BUILDING">hospital</span> and when I came to the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> we became friends for years to come. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">So, that's another face of an American soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But, I never lost faith in the ideals of America and I wanted to go there, although I have already seen some of the shady sides of the face of the American people as exemplified by some of the soldiers. </span><span class="sentence" id="142">Meaning, some homosexuals, some Jew hating soldiers, and eventually I was taken to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> which was a Polish displaced persons camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  Let me interrupt you for a second. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">How you experienced this, did it make you question whether you should remain catholic or admit your Judaism?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  So, when I got to the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Augsburg</span> , at the time when the population of the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> had to be registered, most had lost their 1.d. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">cards and whatever. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">I then had a talk with myself because there was no one I could trust or knew what name I should use. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">My official name was then Kutrzeba, which was the assumed name under which I got the Polish identity card under the German occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">When the time came to register at the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish DP camp</span> , I was wavering what name I should use and despite the couple of incidents of anti-semitism and the rather bitter parting with the military police for whom I was interpreting because of the major and one of the sargeants were anti-semites, I still felt that the overwhelming number of the G.I.s that I met were just great and friendly people, and I felt that I should revert back to my original name. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">Pride in my family and my background, so I had given the name Fajwiszys, the original family name, but as the weeks went by into August, September of 1945 and as I lived in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> with one of the American MPs, the one who became a friend of mine, stopping by occasionally and bringing me cigarettes and candy and all that, I began to experience manifestations of anti-semitism among my fellow Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">It seems that whenever they talked about Jews it was denigrating and Jew boys and I wish they got rid of all of them and worse. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">So, here I was 14:11:30 in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> with Polish population listening to a lot of anti-semitic comments, time and again, with most of them or all of them not knowing that I was also Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">This is no time and place, and I'm not a historian in order to make a case where there was anti-semitism in almost any <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , including the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and there was some anti-semitism in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> before the war, and the fact that there was six years of constant barrage on the average uneducated Pole by the German occupying authorities ridiculing Jews showing in the press caricatures of the Jew with the hook nose who 1s out to rob everybody and cheat everybody and for a case can be made, but this is no time and place for me to raise that. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">The fact is is that I began to experience almost daily anti-semitic conversations. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">That didn't make it easy, and when I was asked about the origin of the name of Fajywiszys which to those who know origin of names, might recognize that it is a Jewish name, I would say that it was a Lithuanian name, because a great many of Lithuanian names end is 1-s. So, I said yes, it's an old family name from <span class="COUNTRY">Lithuania</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="156">Then, when word reached me that a <span class="BUILDING">Polish gymnasium</span> was being formed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> that one could go on with one's studies, I got permission to leave that <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and repaired to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> where I was accepted into the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="157">There was a <span class="BUILDING">Polish gymnasium</span> also in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> specifically in the former SS Kaserne outside of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> where very large <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish dp camp</span> had been formed. </span><span class="sentence" id="158">The Jews had another camp a few miles away and I had nothing to do with that and I have no reason to look up anybody because I was convinced that everybody I knew had perished. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">As I was exposed to some anti-semitism in the American army and in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> I reached the conclusion by myself that the persecution is going to start over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">It's just a matter of time. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">I could not imagine that a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> that was known to be the most civilized in Europe, <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , at least 14:15 by some, launching a genocide with the whole world standing by without that it would start all over again. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">It was just a matter of time, and I didn't want to go through this again, now that I had obtained through some very difficult rambulations. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">My new identity I thought I would stick with it except in the way that my mind formed itself then, by then almost age 18, I felt that I should be proud of my original family name and somehow fake the answers to the origination of the name. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">In the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , I eventually graduated from the <span class="BUILDING">Lyceum</span> in 1947 an accelerated course with excellent marks, and the question was what's next. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">I still bore my original name Fajwiszys. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">But when I got to -- I'm going to start with something else now.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  I just want to ask you a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="168">I just want to a little bit about the conditions or the life in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  The <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">DP camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> was the former <span class="BUILDING">SS barracks</span> but <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> is not quite appropriate because <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Kaserne</span> actually means a center, a <span class="BUILDING">military center</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="170">This was permanent brick <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> with long <span class="INT_SPACE">halls</span> and large <span class="INT_SPACE">rooms</span> where there were double <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="171">Life was fairly miserable meaning extremely skimpy food rations, watery soup, barely enough to sustain a person. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">As children meaning <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> students, we would supposedly get a little more, but I was convinced that there was so much corruption and stealing including the organs the international organs that were channelling the food to us, which was prominently UNRRA, United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency. </span><span class="sentence" id="173">I remember when I broke my front tooth so that I was toothless in the front for about two or three years on crackers sent to us supposedly by American donors to the dps that were so hard they were almost impossible to bite. </span><span class="sentence" id="174">That's how I cracked one tooth. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">It was always a struggle for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">Eventually <span class="BUILDING">UNRRA</span> was turned 14:19: into IRO, International Refugee Organization, but all the scuttlebutt and all the appearances we heard and saw was that there was an enormous corruption, an enormous <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> of food supplies collected from many countries of the world, including I'm sure a great many well meaning people in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> with a great deal of 1t being stolen or ending up on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> and some of the officials getting very rich in the process. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">About a year after I entered the <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> the entire <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> with our teachers was sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">punishment camp</span> by the American authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">By 1946, the Soviets were exerting great political pressure to repatriate all displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">Many of us Polish Nationals hearing that things were very unsettled in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> didn't want to go yet, including the Polish forces who fought with the Allies at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Tobruk</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Monte Cassino</span> and those who helped liberated <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Holland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Belgium</span> and the Polish air force fighting for the battle of <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="180">Eschewal repatriation because of word that the Soviets were entrenched with the Apparatchiks and so on, so that many of us didn't want to go back there until there was an assurance of free elections in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> which as we know had not materialized. </span><span class="sentence" id="181">The pressure on the refugee organizations and the American zone authorities was so strong by the Soviets that there was a constant propaganda to return to one's home country, <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="182">The <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> with our teachers was considered the hot bed of patriotism and nationalism simply because we were the more educated by comparison with the average uneducated inmate of the displaced person's camp, and because the schoolin =  _—-??~=——_s as a unit refused to be repatriated together with our professors who were prewar Polish teachers who found themselves in one way or another in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the war, we were sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">punishment camp</span> in a place called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Altenstadt</span> near <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Garmisch Partenkirchen</span> , wooden <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="183">As it turned out, very cold and hardly heated in winter in order to break our spirit so that we would go to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , help solve the refugee problem for the American authorities and diplomatically help the Western allies who had millions of refugees on their hands in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> further pressured by the Germans themselves who were telling them how can we rebuild our <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with millions of refugees who don't want to go <span class="BUILDING">home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="184">What's going to become of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="185"><span class="COUNTRY">America</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">New Zealand</span> , playing the waiting game, hoping that we all would go back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> that they wouldn't have to admit us as emigrants. </span><span class="sentence" id="186">This waiting game went on in my case for five years. </span><span class="sentence" id="187">But in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Altenstadt</span> when we were herded on a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , we Refugees, displaced persons, members of the nations which fought on the Allied side in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , we were now being sent to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">punishment camp</span> because we refused repatriation under the communist regime. </span><span class="sentence" id="188">On the way to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Altenstadt</span> , we were stopped and searched by the American constabulary who was evoking in us an echo of being transported by the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="189">Here we are a bunch of helpless civilians, Polish Nationals including mostly students of <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> age with their professors guarded by the American constabulary which was a form of military police. </span><span class="sentence" id="190">Some of the MP units on occupation <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> called themselves constabulary. </span><span class="sentence" id="191">At one point, a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> was stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="192">It was warm summer, every one of us refugees of Nazis was searched by the American constabulary and anything that was found in our possession fork, knife, old spoon for which we had no receipts of purchase was thrown on a heap and taken away from us. </span><span class="sentence" id="193">These were the measures employed by a combination of refugee authorities, the American constabulary and as we found out nearby a detachment of CIC where the head of it was a communist, an American officer. </span><span class="sentence" id="194">He also tried to force what he thought Polish nationalist to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , because he may have been under orders to solve the refugee problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="195">Now, if you think of the ignominy of asking refugees to produce a receipt that we had purchased it during and after the war where one simply grabbed a fork 14:26: and a knife whenever one could, but here the American constabulary penalizing us refugees, us Allies to produce what would be under normal conditions in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="196">If you have something, produce a receipt of purchase. </span><span class="sentence" id="197">It was an unforgettable experience to me and the shady side of the American occupation that one had liberated me and on the other hand showed me the ugly side of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="198">Still in all, my faith in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> never faltered because I felt that these were only people and the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> as such is built upon Jeffersonian principles and liberty and justice for all and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="199">And then as I prepared to enter the <span class="BUILDING">University of Munich</span> as a pauper student after graduation, the food was scandalous, the little rations by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="200">I had joined the <span class="BUILDING">Polish student home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> and our entire support was a carton of cigarettes sent by the Polish exile government in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to us, one carton a month. </span><span class="sentence" id="201">That was the entire support. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">So, those of us who smoke had the excruciating choice, to smoke half and sell the other half on the <span class="BUILDING">black market</span> where you buy some food. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">By that time I applied and joined the Polish forces which were assisting the American army and occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">Polish forces put together from ex POWs and refugees and all kinds of young men who had been members of the Polish Armed forces before the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">There were all together I believe 60,000 of them in the American and British Zones of Occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="206">All wore the American or British uniforms with <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> on the shoulder until the cold war started in '48 and the Soviets were launching propaganda that the Americans and the British are cultivating Polish forces to liberate <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="207">End of Tape | Tape 2
ANSWER:  So, when I started attending the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">university of Munich</span> on food rations that one can only imagine, no money no tuition to be sure, I have friends in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> to this day there are three of them that are my buddies, Polish students and to this day share a great friendship. </span><span class="sentence" id="208">We would share a slice of bread and a potato. </span><span class="sentence" id="209">This is '47 and '48, two years after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">We were almost completely destitute, no source of income, no way to earn the money and no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go except starting to attend lectures because every one of us wanted to make some thing of ourselves. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">I then decided that in order to survive and get some decent food I would join the Polish forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">Officially they became to be known as Polish guard, but we where in the service of the American army not armed because the soviets launched a huge propaganda that we were out to liberate <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> that the Americans and the British were cultivating this force in order to march on <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> but we were guarding <span class="BUILDING">American depots</span> and performing a semi police duty for the American army. </span><span class="sentence" id="213">By that time, it was very difficult to get in on that force because there were three square meals a day and <span class="BUILDING">lodging</span> and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="214">Still, I resolved that I would try and what happened was a quirk of fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">When I appeared before the company commander who as it turned out was the prewar Polish army professional warrant officer called , 1n Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">But I had been sufficiently exposed to anti-semitic moments that I resolved at the first opportunity I would have I would revert back to my assumed name, Polish name Kutrzeba, but how to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">The best way to do it when I was about to join that Polish force even though I continued to study at the <span class="BUILDING">university</span> whenever I could, attended lectures, and that 15:04: was the time to obtain a new identity under my old name. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">I appeared before the company commander and had a long interview. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">I showed him my graduation papers from the <span class="BUILDING">Polish gymnasium</span> , but I told him my real name was Kutrzeba and this is how I wanted to be known from now on. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">He asked me why and I had to concoct a new story in order to as by that time I pledged to myself remain Polish and catholic and make an absolutely clean break with Jews, and eventually hoping to immigrate to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> into yet another lions den and I say it advisedly just as went into <span class="REGION">East Prussia</span> with fake Polish documents hoping that in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> I would be less apt to be found out a Jew than by fellow Polish nationals. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">This time I felt I would go to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> as a Polish catholic and as long as I keep away from certain people, nobody would care, nobody would even bother because I had been told that in American as long as you do your job well, nobody cares who you are. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">Well, we'll get to that. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">So, when I appeared 15:06: before the captain and told him that Fajwiszys was a name that I took on because I didn't want to go back to <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> in the event that I was forced to go under my original name Kutrzeba. </span><span class="sentence" id="224">The name Kutrzeba has produced two famous persons in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="225">One was a revered history professor at the <span class="BUILDING">Jagelonian University</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Krakow</span> well known to all the academics and the other was General Kutrzeba after which my father named me. </span><span class="sentence" id="226">He asked me whether I was related, the captain that is, to General Kutrzeba, and I said no not really. </span><span class="sentence" id="227">Within one week I was accepted to enroll and I started within weeks as a corporal, later went to a sergeant and eventually became a second lieutenant with my main duties being teaching English to Polish troops as most of them were hoping to emigrate to an English speaking <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Canada</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Australia</span> , what have you. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">But I also performed the duties of the officer of the day every sixth day or so. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">It was months later that I found out from one of the members of that company that Captain Voiski told him that he knew General Kutrzeba, that I looked like him. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">He was convinced that I was his son except that I was denying it preferring not to ask for extra favors and that was the reason that he hired me even though it was extremely difficult to be hired since the American Army put a quota on how many could be hired. </span><span class="sentence" id="231">So, then I spent two years as an officer for the Polish guard force working directly for the American Army and in the end we received preferential treatment for immigration to the <span class="COUNTRY">U.S.</span> as we served the American army.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="232">QUESTION:  Can I ask a question. </span><span class="sentence" id="233">In all this time, did you feel alone, without family? </span><span class="sentence" id="234">Did you think about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  Being alone and lonely became a fixture, sort of like a lamp 15:09: or the <span class="DLF">sky</span> ora hurricane. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">At times an excruciating experience, a tortuous experience, worse yet because you have no one to confide in, no one to consult. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">I have made errors that in retrospect that if I had a kindly older person to consult or advise me let alone having the kinship and the warmth of the family. </span><span class="sentence" id="238">Now, I was alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">I was friendly with a few of the soldiers there. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">I became friendly with two or three of my fellow Polish students, but strangely enough, at the <span class="BUILDING">Polish student home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , no one spoke of his war time experiences, and we were so touchy and respectful of one another that no one asked the other -- well, we might ask where you're from originally -- no one asked how did you survive, and I'm talking about non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="241">Some Poles were taken into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">labor camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="242">Some participated in the Warsaw uprising, taken prisoner. </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It was almost an unspoken concordat where no one spoke of his war time experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">You don't have to be Jewish to suppress the tortuous and tragic events in your life if they are so close to you as we learned as we got older, 30, 40, 50 years later. </span><span class="sentence" id="245">It took that many years for some people to start confronting the torture of the war time experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="246">At that time, '48, '49, '50, in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> , the emphasis and the focus was on surviving. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">What's tomorrow. </span><span class="sentence" id="248">What am I going to do tomorrow and as we and some of my fellow students whose age range from -- I was the youngest. </span><span class="sentence" id="249">The rest of them were prewar students whose studies were either interrupted by war in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">POW camps</span> or what have you and some were 26 and 30 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="250">So, I was the youngest, and our main focus after all being young and not being able to help ourselves and some whose families they had not heard from or who were also executed. </span><span class="sentence" id="251"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> also had three million citizens executed in addition to three million Polish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Our main focus was on what are we going to eat tomorrow and smoke and where are we going to find young girls to sleep with in addition to studying. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">That was the main focus. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">I in addition who had no family left, no one of my original background left, and I then began to play my role to the fullest of Polish catholic.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="255">QUESTION:  Did you enjoy yourself at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">Did you start a social life?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="257">ANSWER:  Oh, sure, many times "you enjoyed yourself," especially when I started receiving income from serving in the Polish guard and still maintaining a tiny <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> in the <span class="BUILDING">student home</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="258">Of course I went to lectures. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">Of course I milled around with the Germans, but never got close to a single German. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">I remember one or two students took a liking to me and wanted to find out more about me, and wanted to invite me <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to dinner and I turned it down. </span><span class="sentence" id="261">I didn't want to have anything to do with the Germans, although there was no other <span class="NPIP">place</span> to study except at a <span class="BUILDING">German university</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="262">We were given preferential treatment, I mean displaced persons. </span><span class="sentence" id="263">The average young German had to perform physical labor for a year or two or three to clear rubbles and ruins of the bombed <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> until his turn came to attend a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> , because millions of Germans who had not been killed in the war came back and they all wanted to study. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">We displaced 15:14: persons, as long as our credentials academically were sound, were accepted instantly, but the rest of the time there was no money, but if you could get a date with a German girl, sure why not. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">There was nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">You were a young man and blood was boiling so of course you would go to the <span class="DLF">park</span> and go by the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">river</span> and enjoy yourself in the sense where travel was almost impossible, passes were hardly obtainable, money was not there and I was lucky because I was getting three square meals a day and whatever I could I shared with my buddies who tried to scrounge of food someplace else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="267">QUESTION:  But you never got too close to people?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="268">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">I could not get close to anybody because then the questions would follow about family about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and I had enough of my role intact to answer the basic questions, such as my family was killed. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> such and such before the war, <span class="BUILDING">gammer school</span> , who cared and the rest of it was being suppressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="271">QUESTION:  Did you feel like an imposter or that this was just the new you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">ANSWER:  It shifted. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">There was a degree of self loathing at times. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">There was a feeling that I was dishonest toward my newly acquired friends other students, because one day they find out who I really am they would say to me, you were lying to us all along. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">Anybody else who would come even remotely close to my original background, I immediately stayed away from. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">This is how I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> because in the Polish guard forces there were only six, seven officers, a company of about 120, and two of them as I learned gradually were anti-semites and both of them were suspecting me of being Jewish with little innuenendos. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Whenever an innuendo like that was directed towards me, I felt as if my whole world collapsed <span class="NPIP">within</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="278">I would be n utter depression for days, but not knowing what to do with myself and having to put a face out to the world so I would not betray myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">My mind was made up. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">Sooner or later there is going to be another Holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">There is going to be another genocide because it was unthinkable that the world would not try it all over the again, since Jews are reputed to be the killer of Christ, at least that is what I knew up to that ttme. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">My mind was made up that I wasn't going to go through this again, that if I had a new identity and a reasonable speech and deportment that I'm going to preserve that. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So, even though I could have stayed on in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> for another year or two or three, because at that time I was both a student and earning some decent money where I could take girls out on dates and go to the opera and so on and had an imposing uniform and being an 15:18: officer, the Germans respected more than anything else, Herr Leutnant, they would flatten themselves because if it's a military rank the Germans would respect that, no matter who that is. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">If you don't have it, they'll step on you as fast on as a cockroach, but their respect for military uniform and authorities. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">So, I had a fairly decent life in addition to attending <span class="BUILDING">university</span> and teaching English and performing officer of the day every sixth day 24 hours, but I knew that that would not last. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">That could not last, and that I wanted to go away as far as possible with my newly confirmed identity Polish catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">So, when everybody else, at least a great many applied for immigration so did I. One day my number came up. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">I had no affidavit. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I had no relatives that I knew of or wanted to contact. </span><span class="sentence" id="290">Eventually I learned that my father's brother lived in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> for 40 some years, and eventually I got to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">But I put my name on the list and it turned out that this was a contingent provided with blank affidavits by the Connecticut Tobacco Growers. </span><span class="sentence" id="292"><span class="REGION">Connecticut</span> had been growing cigar tobacco for years and years, <span class="DLF">shaded fields</span> , very hard labor. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">Well, a Mr. McCormick from near <span class="REGION">Bradleyfield Connecticut</span> who wanted to get cheap labor, nothing wrong with that, American capitalist, you know, make money where 15:20: you can, had some Jamaican blacks but he wanted to have some nicer white boys from Europe. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">And through the NCWC, National Catholic Welfare Conference, Conference of American Bishops who were acting as the Jewish organizations were and others, to provide blank affidavits for young Polish refugees who had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">So, I came under that quota with $10 in my pocket flown by the Flying Tiger Company in 1950 from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> via <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Keflavik</span> and <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Gander</span> , New Foundland, because <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">jets</span> could not make the transatlantic trip yet, was taken to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">LaGuardia</span> , and driven right to a <span class="DLF">tobacco farm</span> where we started the next morning at 6:00. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">I and some twenty other Polish young men with no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to go were grateful that we were able to obtain American visa and the time was April 1950. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">We came on the <span class="DLF">tobacco farm</span> and were shown our lodgings which were the former <span class="BUILDING">CCC barracks</span> , Civilian Conservation Corp under Roosevelt, clapped together with wooden boards, a <span class="BUILDING">barrack</span> of maybe 30, 40 persons double <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bunks</span> half of them black Jamaican negroes and half of us young Polish people. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Work was back breaking under the shades, there were nets hung to protect the cigar tobacco in case of rain so that the leaves would not be destroyed by rain or hail. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So, I was working 90 degrees in that heat under the nets which were back breaking and humid beyond description. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">75 cents an hour, half of the weekly income was deducted for our food and <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> meaning <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and the food was made by Jamaican cooks. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">To go to the nearest <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">city</span> , <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hartford</span> over the weekend we would probably spend the entire weekly wage whatever was left of it after taxes and deductions for food. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">This was my beginning in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="303">War in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> broke out six weeks after I came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , and when I weighed in my mind what to do next, am I going to finish university studies which were almost out of the land of fantasy, and income and job, I had gone to the <span class="BUILDING">post office</span> in <span class="REGION">Hartford Connecticut</span> to volunteer for the airforce. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I was by that time 22. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I was in reasonably good condition, and I wanted to become a pilot and when I think now what motivated me to volunteer for the U.S. air force, I think there are at least three elements and in what proportion I'm not able to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">One was that in my own view of romantic idealism still in all despite some individual incidents in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> after the liberation, I was alive because so many Americans died to conquer Hitler's machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">I was liberated by the American army. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">I was given entry into the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Now, as I saw it in my fairly naive romantic mind this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> is in trouble. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">It's being attacked by an enemy, that's the North Koreans, so I would volunteer. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">Secondly, I would feel proud to wear a legitimate American uniform. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">Now, I'm fully legitimate finally. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Thirdly, I felt that I would not have to work on a --by that time I know longer worked on a <span class="DLF">tobacco farm</span> because I got a job in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">East Hartford</span> I believe. </span><span class="sentence" id="314">Very, very difficult job where I threw up many times because there was no air conditioning, hot in the summer, working on a machine having to do a quota, also 75 cents an hour and my stomach started acting up and I started throwing up because I was not used to the combination of milk shakes on one hand which I couldn't digest properly and the humidity on the other hand. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">So, by that time I already worked in a <span class="BUILDING">factory</span> and I realized that if I volunteer for the army I'll have rom and board after all and maybe, just maybe I'll be able to continue my studies because I knew by that time what the G.I. bill had been. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">What I didn't know was that it would take a long time before Congress would award the Korean veterans that same as World War II veterans because of political reasons the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> was called police action and not war. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">But, in any event I then got caught in an incredible bureaucratic catch 22. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">The Air Force told me that I couldn't be accepted as a volunteer until I had my first papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">First papers meant the declaration of intention to become a U.S. citizen. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">It would take months before it would be processed bureaucratically and until then they couldn't accept me into the armed forces. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">So, I was willing to wait and one day when I came back -- I was renting a <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> for I think $6 a week in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">West Hartford</span> in <span class="DLF">Beacon Street</span> , two elderly ladies who housed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">One day I came in and my land lady said you 15:27:30have "greetings" and I said from whom? </span><span class="sentence" id="323">And she said from the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , and I found out that that meant a draft notice. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">It was called greetings. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">I said they can't draft me because I already volunteered to the air force and I ran to the captain and he then told me that was the catch 22. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">As a resident of the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> , one could be drafted at any time even a foreign student residing in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> could be drafted under the draft law, but to volunteer you have to have the declaration of intention to become a U.S. citizen which takes months. </span><span class="sentence" id="327">In any event, the army got me and I ended up in I think one of the most abominable divisions I think as far as treatment is concerned the 44th division part of Oklahoma National Guard where the cadre was what we called Oakies. </span><span class="sentence" id="328">There were policemen and all kinds of other men who felt that there would never be another war after World War II therefore they would get the income drink beer over the weekend and get some money for being in the National Guard. </span><span class="sentence" id="329">All of a sudden war in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> broke out, they were federalized and there was something like 3,000 of them cadre and they had to find 10,000 cannon fodder meaning northern boys to become privates and all of them were upgraded and this as I found out they were taking out on us northerners still the vengefulness of the civil war. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">You know, the oakies finally have a chance to get Yankees and to tell them what to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">I went through some pretty hard times there. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Once I was sent on shit detail for two weeks because I defended blacks in the division. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">When I was drafted into the U.S. Army in November of 1950, after very intensive basic training we had gone to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> to train on the island of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hokaido</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="334">The Stars and Stripes wrote that in the entire history of the United States Army there hadn't been as intensive an infantry training as our division because in the wake of the initial American defeats when the war in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> broke out, when it turned out that the average American soldier was unprepared and unfit physically to negotiate all the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">hills</span> up and down, and up and down the terrain with backpacks, the Army was resolved on giving two divisions the 45th infantry Oklahoma National Guard and the 40th called the Sunburst of California to give them the most intensive training. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">And it was one step from <span class="NPIP">hell</span> , the training. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">I then resolved that if I'm going to fight the war for this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> I might as well fight 1t and not get all the chicken feed from the tobacco chewing oakies as we called them and I volunteered for the front line service in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="337">Call it suicide instinct, whatever you wish, but I call it differently but that's for another time. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">Eventually in <span class="COUNTRY">Korea</span> one year in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">battle zone</span> , there was some tough times. </span><span class="sentence" id="339">In fact there was a time with Oklahoma division on training where I seriously considered suicide because I just could not take the vicious handling by the southern non-coms who treated us northern gun fodder with utter contempt. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">This is also when I found out one more facet of true <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> when in Oklahoma National Guard sergeant once came into our <span class="BUILDING">barracks</span> and started -- drunken, started a whole tirade against blacks and there were some blacks that served in our divisions but troops were then still separated, and I opened my big mouth and I said well sergeant I'm serving this wonderful <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> because I believe in it's principle of equality and justice and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Well, my punishment was two weeks on the shed detail, you know, digging ditches and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="342">So, I began to accumulate my treasury of the many facets of <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> by that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">And when I served my time and came to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and applied for <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , I had to wait about nine months or so before the next school year, but I was accepted and eventually I had gone to the <span class="BUILDING">Yale Drama School</span> on three scholarships, the G.I. bill, small scholarship from the <span class="BUILDING">Polish National Home</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Hartford</span> , and after the first semester, a half tuition scholarship from <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> itself. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">Plus, waiting on <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">tables</span> at the <span class="BUILDING">law school</span> , the likes of Bill Lincoln and George Bush [?] </span><span class="sentence" id="345">had gone there probably just before me or certainly after me. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">Two hours a day to earn my three meals. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">Washing windows during Easter vacation when my rich friends went off snowboarding or skiing or whatever, and driving a Good Humor <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ice cream truck</span> in the summer to earn my keep for the next academic year. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">Eventually I married a local New Haven woman, with whom I have a grown daughter, Karen. </span><span class="sentence" id="349">I lived with her for three years, and she still didn't know my background. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">She thought I was Polish catholic, because everything else I was suppressing. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Nobody at <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> knew who I really was. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">Once I almost had a nervous breakdown because it seems that when I got close to someone I couldn't take even a small rejection. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">I thought I fell in love with a fellow student, but I think it was like a puppy love, and things functioned all right as long as I was like someone compared to driving a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> , as long as you're moving and you work and you strive, you're okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">The minute the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">bike</span> stops, you fall off. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">So, that when some feelings started developing toward the young woman I felt that if she didn't respond as much as I would want to emotionally, my whole world collapsed because I could not take what I thought was emotional rejection. </span><span class="sentence" id="356">No family, no friends, no one close, so that became very difficult to handle and it became a recurring pattern later on as well. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">In any event, when I got to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> after graduation something like A minus I guess, you call it with honors, I tried to get a job with CBS because the stage jobs that were available to me were not enough to support a wife and a young child. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">Among others I had gone to <span class="BUILDING">CBS</span> because at that time CBS was developing a lot of good drama, which is now almost gone practically gone. </span><span class="sentence" id="359"><span class="BUILDING">Studio One</span> , etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">The following incident I think 1s rather poignant. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">There was one man in the CBS television by the name of Jim Levinthal who interviewed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">As I was hoping to get an entry while being a page at NBC working the Steve Allen, the Tonight Show and so on, I think $44 a week as a uniform paid for by NBC. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">I had gone tosee Jim Levinthal at <span class="BUILDING">CBS</span> two more times and at one point he said to me-- and he was in charge of hiring production assistants to become stage managers and directors, like John Frankheimer for example who had gone through that route. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">He asked me where did you say you came from and I said I came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="365">He burst out and he said to me, "I'll be goddamn if I'm going to hire for the CBS program department, someone who came from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> ." </span><span class="sentence" id="366">And that was that. </span><span class="sentence" id="367">Jim Levinthal obviously an American Jew and I was a Polish Jew and he turned me down because I had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="368">In this sense I suppose he reaffirmed his glorious American Jewish identity where he wouldn't hire someone who had come from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="369">So much for that scene, and that route was cut off. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">Eventually I got in through another <span class="DLF">door</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="371">While I was at <span class="BUILDING">CBS</span> the first few years of course everybody knew me as a Polish catholic and that as that. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">My marriage was breaking up, and in '59 I was divorced and I was still with CBS. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">About the time before the marriage was broke up after three years, I was driving from <span class="REGION">Hartford Connecticut</span> to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Mt. Vernon</span> New York, where I lived with my then family, and a passenger was a middle aged woman from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="374">She impressed me as having being made of an entirely different cloth. </span><span class="sentence" id="375">Tough and hard nosed and courageous and speaking of the new Israeli pioneer spirit although she introduced herself Polish Jewish. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">At one point she sat in the back, my wife next to me she fired a point blank question. </span><span class="sentence" id="377">Are you Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">Then I surprised myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">It was something in her demeanor, in her deportment that apparently got through to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">She then spent the night with us and one word led to another and it opened up a whole past life for my then wife who knew nothing about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">It was that woman from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> who began to insist whether I had any relatives in the world, and I said that I understood that my father's brother who had come to this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in the 20s that he was here somewhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">She wanted to know why I wouldn't look him up and I said of course not. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">First of all, he wouldn't understand me. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">He would condemn me. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Secondly, I have nothing to do with him. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">I never met him, and I have some questions to him if I met him which I don't want to, what was he doing when we were being 'geharget" as they say in Yiddish, or exterminated and I don't want to go through the whole war time history with him because he would want it. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">She had undertaken upon herself to try to trace my uncle, my father's younger brother, and when she had made contact, she prevailed on me to meet him using every kind of appeal for me to consent. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">When I finally did, we made a date because my uncle lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Brooklyn</span> and we lived in Mt. Vernon. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">We made a date to meet at <span class="BUILDING">Rockefeller Center</span> , <span class="DLF">30 Rock Plaza</span> , as you walk in through the main <span class="DLF">door</span> , I remember, in the main <span class="INT_SPACE">lobby</span> , he described how he would look and Mrs. Bergman, the woman from <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> accompanied me. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">At once we saw a little man, slim with an elderly woman apparently his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">She approached him and confirmed his identity. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">He walked up to me -- that is my uncle, my closest living relative, 1959, which is 14 years after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">He pulled me to the side, walked over toward the very corner of the <span class="DLF">marble wall</span> there, and said to me are you Joe, Yossl? </span><span class="sentence" id="395">I said yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">He looked to me turned towards the <span class="DLF">wall</span> and started crying like a little baby. </span><span class="sentence" id="397">He couldn't say another word. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">It was I who had to gently pat him on the back and say Uncle Sam, all right, calm down now. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">I had to calm him down. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">Well, eventually I started visiting him and my marriage broke up, but shortly before it did, my wife started to persuade me to try to find out who I really am because I was between and betwixt. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">All of a sudden when that Pandora's box had been tapped I had no idea of who I was anymore, how I should act, what I should aim for and what my identity was etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">So, that my uncle- through a ruse I found later, but through a ruse, made an appointment with me and a 16:14: Rabbi in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New Rochelle</span> , who then was the presiding Rabbi of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="403">It's a rotating function. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">Rabbi David Golemvenski, now deceased. </span><span class="sentence" id="405">Through a ruse because if my uncle would have asked me to see a Rabbi I would have turned him down. </span><span class="sentence" id="406">I would say I have nothing to do with a Rabbi. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">I didn't even know one before the war in a Jewish family which was traditional but not very religious. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">But he used a rouse together with a rabbi I was told that the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Center</span> needed a director to direct a play. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">That was the rouse. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">I said sure, okay. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">When I went there little by little, he was a rabbi in the U.S. Marine Corp and advisor in Jewish Affairs among others to President Roosevelt. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">A man very accomplished and very bright. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">Well, one word led to another and he started a series of conversations with me and once I opened up I started letting him have it. </span><span class="sentence" id="414">I said where were all the rabbis when we were being surrounded. </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Where were the rabbis when we had to reaffirm our national identity in the spirit of resistance they instead urged us not to offer any resistance because a good Jew doesn't she blood and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Where were all the rabbis that for two thousand years taught us passivity instead of reaffirmation of human dignity through resistance and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="417">By the time that I started these conversations after I had met the rabbi once only I decided to seek out Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, who was a national figure, like Reverend Robertson today or Billy Graham. </span><span class="sentence" id="418">Fulton Sheen as a bishop had a half hour show on t.v. </span><span class="sentence" id="419">nationwide and was an incredible speaker. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">So, I thought I would repair to him and seek his advice. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">I was in his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> on <span class="DLF">Muray Hill</span> a number of times, and we had many conversations and it was then that my uncle Sam said to me well, you're a rational man. </span><span class="sentence" id="422">You went to <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="423">Certainly why shouldn't you listen to the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="424">I said sure it makes sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">And I started seeing Rabbi Golovensky. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">In the final analysis it didn't solve many of my problems of identity and the really point of explosion occurred when my uncle in about 1960 or so finally one day laid it on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">table</span> and said to honor my parents and to honor Jewish people in my heritage and so on, he says I had been baptized under duress as he called it and I called it not. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">I said it was of my own volition. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">He said well, what did you know you were 15 years old. </span><span class="sentence" id="429">You were frightened, you were terrified to death and the man was kind to you and told you there is another god who is more valid and so on and in the name of that god Jews had been murdered for centuries and in the name of Christ allegedly as Christ killers, the biggest lie in history. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">So, my uncle made me an ultimatum, in fact wrote me a letter which I believe I have to this day saying that I ought to publicly renounce catholicism and reconvert to be a Jew, possibly some kind of a mumbo jumbo ceremony. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">I said absolutely not. </span><span class="sentence" id="432">Whatever happened, happened, and it happened because a magnificent young man, a priest, in the name of his god, but his god must be our god if we believe in unideism, or else nothing makes sense. </span><span class="sentence" id="433">In the name of the higher postulates of religion and human morality he risked his life because he 16:19: believes that love thy neighbor is the basic tenet. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">A man who did that for me in the name of his religion or call it is liturgy cannot be wrong, must be a worthy person and I am not going to spit him in the face and walk out on everything he taught me only because you who did nothing to save me want me to. </span><span class="sentence" id="435">We had a few very explosive conversations and it sent me into a long bout of depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">I believe at that point CBS has layoffs so the people with least seniority had to be laid off. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">As it turned out several months later they rehired me, but I already had a job with the <span class="COUNTRY">U.N.</span> then, and I was in the most abysmal state of depression. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">Again deserted, again alienated from everybody, again feeling myself deserted by my next of kin who said that if I don't reconvert he will condemn me and doesn't want to have anything to do with me. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">In one of the conversations I remember was rather explosive in his <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and I asked him point blank, telling him that a decent Pole, a Christian with the help of a few other priests saved my life, risking 1t every minute of the day and I asked him at one point, what did you do Uncle Sam to save your own family at the time when strangers were saving Jews lives? </span><span class="sentence" id="440">What did you do? </span><span class="sentence" id="441">And he started giving me what I call etcha petcha metcha, which means well you know there was some anti-semitism and there were the German Bund here and it wasn't so easy, and I said did you chain yourself to the <span class="DLF">gate</span> of the <span class="BUILDING">White House</span> as a protest because your brother and you family was being exterminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">If you didn't you have no right to tell me how to live my life, and what friend to honor, and whom to be loyal to. </span><span class="sentence" id="443">So, the following period, if I remember, about two years where I had nothing to do with him or his wife. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">And I was told in retrospect that he couldn't sleep nights. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">That he was crying and so on, but what I felt all along would happen that sooner or later if not my uncle then someone else would condemn me a traitor to the Jewish race because I was baptized. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">Along in about 1962, by pure chance I had walked into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yivo</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish Historical Institute</span> because Rabbi Golvensky felt and insisted that I ought to go. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">There may be a photograph or maybe something of my family of my past because I had nothing to reestablish the link with my past and to his credit he insisted and pressed me. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">So, I did, and when I walked into <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yivo</span> , and said who I was, my original name, there still was on the staff the few survivors who of course knew music and culture in <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> , and a man by the name of Finklestein immediately popped and said of course I knew your father. </span><span class="sentence" id="449">I said to myself, yes, a lot of people say they know my father like a lot of people know the pope, or Lenny Bernstein but does he know everyone. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">I was used to that by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">When I was a child everybody said I know your father and it turned out my father didn't even know the man. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">So, within minutes he called from upstairs, as it turned out a revered, gentleman by the name of Jonas Turkow, a famous Polish actor and director before World War II, who as it turned out was a friend a my father was with my father in the committee for underground in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="453">His wife was the famous Diana Blumenthal, a chanteuse for whom my father wrote songs at one time, and he came down when I was introduced. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">Finklestein said this 1s Joseph Fajwiszys, he said you are little Joe? </span><span class="sentence" id="455">I said, yes I guess so. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">Well, that's when the next chapter in my long track to reestablish my roots so to speak had begun. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Because Ilu Turkow then had me in this <span class="BUILDING">home</span> and with his wife Diana Blumenthal showed me a handwritten song my father wrote once for his wife which he buried in a can in the Warsaw Ghetto ruins before he managed to scale the <span class="DLF">wall</span> posing as a Polish railroad man and found it after the war. </span><span class="sentence" id="458">He gave me and I still have it, and a long, long conversation started with a man whose daughter, herself, had been given over to Christians and when he survived the war his daughter who by then was eight or nine was saying oh those goddamn Jews, was inbued with anti-semitism by the very people to whom Turkoff entrusted his own daughter. </span><span class="sentence" id="459">So, his daughter also had a very difficult <span class="DLF">road</span> back but at least had the original father and mother and so on, and still I understand as of a few years ago, she's not in very good shape mentally. </span><span class="sentence" id="460">Well, Turkoff as if he had found his own son. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">This went on for a number of months. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">I came to respect him and regard him highly because he had no religious ax to grind. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">He was just a man of culture. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">A man of tradition but progressive and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">And one day, he told me that a man had visited him who was in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and that he would like to start an organization that had something to do with those who were in the resistance movement in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Warsaw Ghetto</span> and wanted me to be part of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="466">I had grave scruples. </span><span class="sentence" id="467">I didn't want to do anything about it, but more and more he appealed to my conscience and the rest is history, because the few of us that's Jack Eisner, Jonas Stutkoff, Bob Bjorn and Joe Tulesky, Latka Meed and myself, formed an organization that we didn't know for weeks how to call it. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">Finally I came up with the acronym WAGRO, Warsaw Ghetto Resistance Organization and I threw myself into that work, even though I was with <span class="BUILDING">CBS</span> at the same time. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">We wanted to among other things, the objectives we discussed but then I wrote them the final version and they're still everyday at <span class="BUILDING">Madison Square Garden</span> it's all there, it's all my language among other things is to build a memorial to Warsaw Ghetto heroes in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="470">And we started raising funds for it with $1 little coupon contributions. </span><span class="sentence" id="471">| sold them to anybody, from Walter Cronkite, to Mike Wallace, you name it, hundreds. </span><span class="sentence" id="472">Then it turned out from the treasurer I couldn't get an accounting of how much money we took in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="473">QUESTION:  How did this impact you psychologically when you had to all of sudden start dealing with a past that you had put very much in the back of your mind? </span><span class="sentence" id="474">16:27
ANSWER:  Well, both consciously and unconsciously I think that I felt that I finally no matter what the religious scruples were and no matter which <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> I chose to pray in that it's my own damn business but at least Iam who I am and I am the son of my father and I am the product of a certain tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">The conflicts came with what I call the low class people, the Yiddishists, not that every Yiddishist is low class. </span><span class="sentence" id="476">Don't misunderstand me. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">There are some marvelous writers and poets, but Yiddishist in this context I call low class people who even before the war didn't know the language of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> but only spoke Yiddish and now wanted to remake history in the image of their particular social class. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">And people who wore their congressional medal honor which I called their <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> star, as a congressional medal of honor. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">In other words, any Jew who had not been to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> can only be relegated to secondary or tertiary role because they were the front line troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">If you were not in a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> , you don't count. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">Your voice is not important. </span><span class="sentence" id="482">You were too assimilated. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">If you know Polish literature 1f you want to speak your mother tongue, which was Polish in my case, and the case of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Anielewicz</span> , that's secondary. </span><span class="sentence" id="484">Yiddish is our language, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> is our passport and that's that. </span><span class="sentence" id="485">They would not admit any dissenting voices. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">My clean break with them came after a year and a half where I was the only American educated member with everyone asking me to do things from the composition to board of directors and getting a non profit status and tax exempt status and doing the first two commemorations including one at <span class="BUILDING">Carnegie Hall</span> organizing the whole thing artistically and managerially and all I asked for is that we run ourselves according to the American principles of legality and democracy. </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So, when it came to elections, and I had no ambition to be a president but only to elect someone else, there were two slates and they quashed down the second slate with big arms and strong pushy elbows and at that time, I left. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">So once more I left my people. </span><span class="sentence" id="489">End of Tape 2 Tape 3
ANSWER:  Ever since I began to acknowledge my roots which goes back to '59 and '62, it's been now over 30 years of intermittent, at time tortuous, inner life, except that I no longer am hiding -- parts of me are still hiding, but by and large I'm not. </span><span class="sentence" id="490">A cynic might say it comes with age because the closer we are to the end of our life we care less about when it might start all over again and from history we know that the ways of persecution of Jews and we see in the world today where other minorities are occasionally being exterminated by others. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">You don't have to be Jewish to be a Biafran, Nigerian, Bosnian and Serbian, and so on and so on, but you begin to care less and less about survival at any cost. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">Now it matters, survival with integrity. </span><span class="sentence" id="493">As I was construing my integrity way back then, I felt that and I've been throughout my childhood that any Jew who would convert 1s a traitor to the nation, and I believed it because what else was I to believe except everything I was taught. </span><span class="sentence" id="494">Eventually through the shock of the selections and the extermination phase when I was desperate and destitute and a young priest put his life on the <span class="DLF">line</span> for me, but also taught me a great many things which I had not been taught in my childhood. </span><span class="sentence" id="495">I was taught a few prayers, just mumbling them in order to satisfy one class in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and that was the end of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="496">I had been to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> maybe two three times a year on the high holidays because my father felt that he ought to put in an appearance and occasionally he conducted a 12 voice choir or played the philharmonia which was sort of like an organ. </span><span class="sentence" id="497">But it had been inbuted in me that throughout that a Jew who is baptized and is converted is a traitor to his nation. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">He does it only for self advancement or for other commercial reasons. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">That is why I felt that when I was baptized by the priest and I remember once he told me that it would be interesting to know if I would hold faith with the truth as he taught me in addition to love thy neighbor of which he was the best exemplified tenet, but also about Christ and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">He said at one point it would be interesting to know that when the war was over if I would keep faith, because he says throughout centuries Jews converted in order to survive when it was more convenient and when the threat was no longer there they reconverted as he said a Jew will always be a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">I was determined to prove to him as I construed my integrity that that was not so, that I would be faithful to the faith as he taught me. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">That I would not change 180 degrees the minute it was convenient to me and the minute that was over that I could get help from Jewish organizations. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">In fact I had never gone to a Jewish organization. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> on my own, worked on a <span class="DLF">tobacco farm</span> but I would not go to a Jewish organization because then I would have to go through the third degree and say oh but I baptized, I'm very sorry now could you help me with money. </span><span class="sentence" id="505">I would not do that. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">So, throughout all this I felt that I've lost everything, but my integrity as a human being, and as a human being I ought to keep faith with the priest that saved my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">That was my contract, that's it's okay to convert when you saw the true light or human kindness or mercy as exemplified by another religion, but it's not okay to reconvert because then you have no values left.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="508">QUESTION:  Is religion a contract or is simply a belief?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="509">ANSWER:  Being in contact with Father Furkosksy for the last 50 years, I was guilty of not answering his letters sometimes for a year or longer, but he never got angry. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">He always wrote again and again with love and compassion and understanding until we had our first reunion and second and then later on in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> when he was decorated and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">But there were long periods when I didn't see contact with 17:07:30 him because I felt I would have to live up to what he expected me, and I found that I progressively could not. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">I could not live a chaste life. </span><span class="sentence" id="513">As I told him once that without a love of a woman, I don't want to live in this world. </span><span class="sentence" id="514">He said he could understand that, that I had to get to the bottom of the few reasons for the persecution of Jews as he had implanted in me. </span><span class="sentence" id="515">That resulted eventually in a film that I was prevailed upon to do, namely Children in the Holocaust that nearly devastated me. </span><span class="sentence" id="516">I just couldn't sleep nights and so on and going to ten <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> and listening to stories of some of the survivors that I couldn't even imagine that such plight existed in other cases. </span><span class="sentence" id="517">And throughout it all I had to find myself. </span><span class="sentence" id="518">Myself meaning that at one point I read all the four epistles from beginning to end and I immersed myself in books on the sources of anti-semitism and by omission and commission and by hiding by running away by struggling over many years, I have finally reached what I believe is going to stay with me and stick with me and that's me. </span><span class="sentence" id="519">That's only in the last few recent years. </span><span class="sentence" id="520">What is me, first of all. </span><span class="sentence" id="521">I am who I am in terms of my birth, my roots, my heritage. </span><span class="sentence" id="522">There's no getting away from that. </span><span class="sentence" id="523">I am proud of it as much as an Irishman 1s proud to be Irish and a Pole is proud to be Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="524">No more and no less. </span><span class="sentence" id="525">I condemn and have so done in articles and speeches that I have made. </span><span class="sentence" id="526">People no matter what their ethnic grouping is, Jews or non Jews who look for a scape goat. </span><span class="sentence" id="527">Anti-semites look for Jews as scapegoats when the economy is down and they say it's all the faults of the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="528">Jews when they feel empowered find a scapegoat in others. </span><span class="sentence" id="529">Whether they be certain degrees of second citizenship among Palestinians, and I'm not a utopian and I know the reality and self preservation, or for many years claiming that all Poles are anti-semites, which 1s equally untrue. </span><span class="sentence" id="530">Because according to Yad va Shem 37 percent of all righteous Christians honored were Poles. </span><span class="sentence" id="531">There are Jewish circles who condemn Poles for anti- semitism simply because it is now more convenient because there are now until at least recently they were more helpless than the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="532">The same Jews who go to visit <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or receive pension checks from <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> do not attack Germans en bloc but they do attack Poles en bloc, meaning that there are some absolutely undeniable facts. </span><span class="sentence" id="533">The undeniable facts are the holocaust, the Nazi extermination and their collaborators. </span><span class="sentence" id="534">That is absolutely undeniable. </span><span class="sentence" id="535">It is also undeniable that among other <span class="COUNTRY">nations</span> there were victims who were tortured because of the nationalism, because they saved others, a few hundred Polish priests and nuns were executed because they sheltered the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="536">That cannot be shoved under the rug either. </span><span class="sentence" id="537">We Jews do not have the license to righteousness only or to suffering. </span><span class="sentence" id="538">We must continuously also honor those who were tortured by dictatorship and Nazism and continuously uphold as role models those who risked their lives to save many of us. </span><span class="sentence" id="539">So, who am I? </span><span class="sentence" id="540">I'm a Jew and a Pole. </span><span class="sentence" id="541">I'm also an American citizen and I hope a very loyal one. </span><span class="sentence" id="542">But anybody who would want to press further be they a scientist or a common Yente would want the question between diverse would always be no, so who are you? </span><span class="sentence" id="543">So, do you go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or do you believe in Jesus Christ? </span><span class="sentence" id="544">My first answer is non of your goddamn business. </span><span class="sentence" id="545">What I do in private is my own self -- my own business as long as I don't deny who I am and whether I am more comfortable to walk into <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> , that's my own business. </span><span class="sentence" id="546">Now, for posterity and for the sake of bearing witness and making a record, do I believe in Jesus Christ because it all comes down to that right, sooner or later, right. </span><span class="sentence" id="547">Either you do or you don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="548">Either you go right or you go left, said Mengele, right? </span><span class="sentence" id="549">First of all, I don't agree with that kind of a Nazi theory that I owe it to anybody, to anybody in the world, to publicly identify myself with this or with that. </span><span class="sentence" id="550">Having said that, my personal belief to this day is do I believe in God? </span><span class="sentence" id="551">Sometimes yes, sometimes not. </span><span class="sentence" id="552">I believe that if he's omnipotent, he must have been on vacation for a very long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="553">I think I'm familiar with almost every dogmatic or <span class="BUILDING">church</span> , dogmatic possible answer to the 17:15: question. </span><span class="sentence" id="554">Well, God had simply set these things in mechanism but he gave us free will and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="555">I am familiar with every one of these postulates because I've been taught and I discussed it with my priest and with others. </span><span class="sentence" id="556">Recently with a father professor of the <span class="BUILDING">catholic university</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lublin</span> who was here. </span><span class="sentence" id="557">We had hours of conversation. </span><span class="sentence" id="558">So, do I believe in God? </span><span class="sentence" id="559">Sometimes I do and sometimes I don't. </span><span class="sentence" id="560">Do I believe in Jesus Christ? </span><span class="sentence" id="561">From every historical bit 1f evidence, there was such a man who lived and such man must have been a role model along with several others throughout the ages for humanity to pursue possibly never to attain, because who's willing to just abscond everything and just put on a sack and eschew all the riches of the world etc, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="562">Since such men lived, and expounded all the goodness and all the mercy, this to me along with some other somewhat antiquated wise sayings from the bible and the koran and whatever constitutes the essence of human ethics and morality but advanced one or two steps more. </span><span class="sentence" id="563">Meaning, that goodness and love they neighbor is no longer the province of Jews toward fellow Jews but anyone is my neighbor, anyone is. </span><span class="sentence" id="564">If that had not been taken seriously by my savior, my priest, and thousands of others like him, I wouldn't be here to talk to you, and the last vestiges of morality and ethics expounded by the three major religions would be gone, even though they collapsed long ago in Europe which has fought catholic and protestant one another. </span><span class="sentence" id="565">So, that if Jesus Christ expounded these ideals in the name of which people are willing risk their lives to serve their neighbor, a stranger, these are some of the highest ideals in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="566">Now, to go to one step further to the ultimate level, do you believe he was a god? </span><span class="sentence" id="567">Well, there are theologians to this day who are not sure, protestant and catholic. </span><span class="sentence" id="568">I read all 17:18: four epistles cover to cover to this day, and I don't see anywhere Christ saying Iam God. </span><span class="sentence" id="569">He said I am the son of God, but in the next chapter, another evangelist or he himself says, we are all children of God, so to claim the deity of God, the immaculate conception of Virgin Mary which some protestant reject also can go on and go on. </span><span class="sentence" id="570">In the final analysis who do I pray to? </span><span class="sentence" id="571">None of your goddamn business. </span><span class="sentence" id="572">I pray when I pray to God whenever I have hopes that he exists and not that he owes me a lot, but I think he owes all of us a lot in order to justify the innocent slaughter of children, millions of them in the world, to this day. </span><span class="sentence" id="573">But if there is some kind of a mechanism that I don't understand, then I'm willing to say well I don't understand that and in times when I must clutch onto something, and if I believe that there is a god, yes, sometimes I pray to him. </span><span class="sentence" id="574">What I say to him is between him and me. </span><span class="sentence" id="575">I own no accounting to anyone else, possibly to the man who saved my life, but then he and I we have our own way of communicating. </span><span class="sentence" id="576">We understand each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="577">QUESTION:  Is it possible for with your experiences to live with no acknowledgement of religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="578">ANSWER:  Well, the same question can be posed to millions of other Americans who --
QUESTION:  Yes, but I'm talking about you. </span><span class="sentence" id="579">Is religion important to you today?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="580">ANSWER:  Well, if I reached the end of my struggle maybe I'll be able to phrase it better for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="581">I'm still struggling day by day. </span><span class="sentence" id="582">I very seldom go to <span class="BUILDING">church</span> or <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="583">When I do, sometimes I'm very comfortable in <span class="BUILDING">church</span> and at times when I get the goose pimples thinking that in the name of this or that my ancestors were being murdered by the thousands. </span><span class="sentence" id="584">When I go to a <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> I don't really feel very much because it's been dulled by what I think has been the exclusiveness of the Jewish religion as we know it today. </span><span class="sentence" id="585">That I no longer feel having been with many non Jews in situation of extreme danger and in combat and in living in suffering with non-Jews as well and seeing that they have the same humanity as I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="586">They also suffer and cry and shake when there is fear, and often would do anything for me as I have few friends like this, like these non-Jews, I refuse to acknowledge that I am somehow the chosen smarter, more talented, better and more adept than my fellow citizens, or good friends, non-Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="587">I refuse to. </span><span class="sentence" id="588">I excel in one <span class="NPIP">way</span> and they excel in something else. </span><span class="sentence" id="589">I cannot be part of an official religion that claims we are the chosen people and continue to be chosen because that is an invitation to exclusivity and to snobbish. </span><span class="sentence" id="590">You might say survival also, but it's not our fault that the world had stolen the reformed Judaism from us because I call Jesus Christ the reformed Judaism. </span><span class="sentence" id="591">From every available fact, he simply tried to reform the ongoing corruption that sooner or later seeps into everything, into government into any organized religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="592">He tried to reform that and anytime you try to reform an establishment you're going to be condemned. </span><span class="sentence" id="593">This goes on in the U.S. air force or Jewish religion everywhere else. </span><span class="sentence" id="594">I simply cannot be part of a segment, 17:24: religious or otherwise that claims exclusivity and somehow a level above everyone else that may have existed at one time, but I don't think it should any longer and I am all for people organizing and having cultural groups and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="595">If you want to go to <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> that's fine, but 1f you ask me, I have been back and forth to <span class="NPIP">hell</span> and back so many times that I only --it's nice when I can speak Polish or when I'm with a few people who were born in the same <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Jewish section</span> as I was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , but the rest of the time I seek the few who are imbued with value of humanity because unfortunately as time and again when push comes to shove it's the small minority that comes to the top when they have a chance, the gangsters and others, give the mafia half a chance and they'll rule, permeate Italian government, you name it. </span><span class="sentence" id="596">The bulk of the people care about only what they're going to do and eat the next day and how they're going to dress their children. </span><span class="sentence" id="597">For that sake, they're willing to swallow anything and they will not do much and they will not risk their neck and a small percentage of what I call elite of humanity are the noblest and the finest. </span><span class="sentence" id="598">They're seldom rich. </span><span class="sentence" id="599">They're seldom on top of the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="600">They're seldom occupying the highest positions, but I only seek out those people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="601">QUESTION:  I'm thinking that to some extent you dismissed religion as a contract, I'm wondering what it is that made you have a need to find your roots? </span><span class="sentence" id="602">What is important about religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="603">ANSWER:  Which religion?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="604">QUESTION:  Any religion and yours that made you need to see him again?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="605">ANSWER:  I have not sought the Jewish religion if you mean by organized religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="606">I think that some of the abuses in the world have been committed in the name of religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="607">I have not come back to my roots to seek the Jewish religion, not at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="608">I've come back to my roots first of all to make peace with myself not to continue living with self denial. </span><span class="sentence" id="609">Secondly, to honor the memory of my father and my mother and my sister. </span><span class="sentence" id="610">They were who they were and they were innocently slaughtered and I have no right to deny them. </span><span class="sentence" id="611">Everything else in terms of my public identification with many of the manifestations of what we call religious life, I see so much intellectual corruption and twisting and revision wherever I turn, be it the Jewish organized life or catholic organized life, so I didn't seek to be admitted to the bosom of the Jewish religion. </span><span class="sentence" id="612">It doesn't mean a thing to me. </span><span class="sentence" id="613">I don't seek to be an official member of the <span class="BUILDING">catholic church</span> either.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="614">QUESTION:  I think what I'm asking 1s, is the Jewish religion for you? </span><span class="sentence" id="615">I'm not saying going to the <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> every Friday night, but does it embody a sense of history a sense of tradition, a sense of culture.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="616">ANSWER:  History, tradition, culture, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="617">QUESTION:  It's part of you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="618">ANSWER:  As far as the widening of the ethical and moral concept of the Jewish bible onto the rest of humanity, I think that this is what Christianity accomplished although it has been guilty of many lies such as expropriating the reform Judaism as I call Jesus Christ as a rabbi, expropriating and in the name of accepting his tenets of love thy neighbor, murdering Jews which is the most advanced lie and bigotry in the world. </span><span class="sentence" id="619">But I do believe that the way of making ethics and morality available to all humanity is the way that I believe 18:01: it. </span><span class="sentence" id="620">Call it what you will. </span><span class="sentence" id="621">If anybody would ask me the catch all question as to what have been the after effects and the consequences of all these experiences, well it's like trying to reduce Homer's odyssey down to one paragraph. </span><span class="sentence" id="622">One can do it only with sufficient distance, and I think now after some 50 years I think I have achieved sufficient distance. </span><span class="sentence" id="623">In my case first of all for many years I had to play many roles. </span><span class="sentence" id="624">It's like the seven ages of man from Shakespeare. </span><span class="sentence" id="625">Until and only recently I stopped playing roles. </span><span class="sentence" id="626">In other words, I would bend my behavior to what I felt I should sound like, speak like, behave and what my attitudes should be to one person versus another person depending on who they were, Americans, Poles, Jews, etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="627">So, I played various roles. </span><span class="sentence" id="628">That eventually resulted in not only dichotomy, but in some self loathing as to who I am. </span><span class="sentence" id="629">That has been the easier part. </span><span class="sentence" id="630">More difficult part that caused me incessant inner torture and suffering and 18:03: struggling has been the alienation for most of my life from most people. </span><span class="sentence" id="631">So, with the result that I don't trust most people anyway, and the few instances that someone appeals to me, I tend to go overboard, meaning that I try to make up for what I lost in growing up, in the love of father, mother, sister, relatives, teachers, peers and so on, and become periodically over enthusiastic and overtrusting until I get disappointed but that began to level itself off with age. </span><span class="sentence" id="632">So, I am absolutely convinced that my one great regret is that if I didn't have these crippling problems of running away, of alienation of avoiding deeper relationships, that I could have achieved much more than I have, and to some degree I have achieved what I was able to do, but in spite of my problems and difficulties. </span><span class="sentence" id="633">Three university diplomas and a stint on broadway, starting my own <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> , etc. </span><span class="sentence" id="634">etc, the rest is in Who's Who in <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , but I'm still extremely dissatisfied with myself because I think I could have and should have achieved more. </span><span class="sentence" id="635">When I would go on vacation for example with my second wife who told me that I was the biggest pain in the neck when I was on vacation because within a day or two I was already restless and wanting to get back to start another project or get back to work. </span><span class="sentence" id="636">I simply could not enjoy vacation because I think deep down I felt that I had no right to just be merry and mirthful and enjoy myself while all my people had been exterminated. </span><span class="sentence" id="637">It's a sense of guilt that every day that I get up that I don't further the cause of either bearing witness or creating yet another project and justify my survival. </span><span class="sentence" id="638">Whatever I have accomplished which by some measure is little, and by other point of view may be I suppose of note, has happened despite great many personal problems in relating to people. </span><span class="sentence" id="639">For example, when I was with <span class="BUILDING">CBS</span> and case in point when I worked with Don Hewitt who is now a big celebrity, creator of 60 minutes etc., </span><span class="sentence" id="640">this is just a case 1n point, not to appear on Entertainment Tonight, but I know that I could have easily been one of the producers or directors on 60 minutes or soap operas or whatever and I have worked against myself a critic might say in that when I felt for example that on a soap opera that the values were trite, that they were mundane, that they were exploitive, I had such contempt for the people who in view of everything that has happened to this world and to me personally and to holocaust and all of that, that these people could still deal with these trite and superficial problems instead of delving deeper into the human conditions for the edification of themselves and others, that I literally had contempt for those values and I'm sure that I've shown it and said so a number of times. </span><span class="sentence" id="641">Well, that's why I'm not a producer or a director on a soap opera making a quarter million dollars a year today, but it doesn't matter to me because I would spitting in my face if I build my life around these trite values.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="642">QUESTION:  Do you have the right to enjoy yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="643">ANSWER:  To me enjoyment is even with no holocaust but simply responding to my education in the European condition in my <span class="DLF">field</span> which has been <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> and lately expanded into television maybe film, that simply is being faithful to my profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">A doctor considers his calling, if he's a good doctor, to treat others and prevent suffering and pain. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">Well, being in the <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> from which I have emerged professionally, my calling is to examine the human condition, sometimes through laughter, often seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">But 18:09: the triteness and the superficiality that I find in the <span class="DLF">commercial field</span> to me is repugnant. </span><span class="sentence" id="647">It's a violation of every - - it's the same way that a doctor would work only to push as much penicillin or aspirin as he possibly can only to enrich himself, you know just push prescriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="648">QUESTION:  Can you enjoy a walk on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="649">ANSWER:  Oh yes of course I can. </span><span class="sentence" id="650">But..
QUESTION:  Simple pleasures?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="651">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">But to go off on vacation for more than a few days, I feel guilty and I feel that I am not doing something worthwhile. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">You don't have to be Jewish to enjoy Jewish rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">You don't have to live through the Holocaust to be committed to some deeper values and the calling of the profession. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">But I think it's only been exacerbated by my experiences because I think that I ought to do something meaningful all the time to justify my survival and in that sense I'm not the ideal person to live with and only think of what fun to dedicate myself to after working hours. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And for many, many years having lost my family, having lived in so much fear and terror, having felt myself abandoned by my family, by Jews, by the rest of the world, it was probably inevitable that in personal relationships for many years, I would construe a small slight as a reyection and then respond in kind by either more forceful repartee or by running away. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">In other words, terminating a relationship, and this has haunted me for many, many years. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">Until by the time I was able to gain an insightful look into it, I was getting older. </span><span class="sentence" id="659">So, that's been the other after affect but it's like saying someone what is it like giving birth to a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">You can understand it intellectually, but unless you've gone through all the trepidations and the enormous pain, you don't really understand it. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">So, you can talk 18:12: about these things, but to have lived through the constant terror first to survive, and then to protect what you construed was your integrity but in fact was a false identity and live in terror of being unmasked. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Because if I was unmasked then I had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="663">I had no <span class="NPIP">place</span> to turn. </span><span class="sentence" id="664">There was no going back and thee was no going forward, so I had to protect that carefully constructed false identity and I think this has been the greatest curse of the after affects. [</span><span class="sentence" id="665">PAUSE] Well, there is, as you probably know a film made by a Kibbutz Lokhamei Hagettaoth in <span class="COUNTRY">Israel</span> some 20 years ago called the 29th blow or 49th Blow or something. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">That is somewhat a dramatic of my approach, the conclusion of that film. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">In other words, there was a survivor who somehow lived through some 27 blows being whipped by SS or by the Gestapo. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">But the worst, the 28th blow was after the war when he had found out that the world was so little interested in what he had to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="669">I remember when we established the Warsaw Ghetto Resistance Organization in 1962 and wanted to come out with the first commemoration ever of the Warsaw Ghetto heroes that we couldn't find one Jewish community group or one <span class="BUILDING">synagogue</span> in the greater New York would give us a <span class="INT_SPACE">hall</span> free of charge in which to hold the commemoration. </span><span class="sentence" id="670">This was before it became fashionable to attache yourself in more ways than one, socially, economically, financially, status wise to the word holocaust. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">And sooner or later of course it is fall into the hands of the establishment or people who have either economic ax to grind or want to enrich themselves by publishing this or that. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">And that hurts but I suppose that is inevitable, and so we are the last dying breed because when the war broke out I was 11 which means I was old enough to remember what was going and young enough to attain my present age and talk about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="673">But with my generation when we begin dying out that is the end of those who will bear witness, and then what hurts 1s that it will fall into the 18:16: hands of the interpreters, the revisionists, even the honest revisionists who are going to place this or that emphasis because they will have their own ax to grind. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">When you watch a play or a film called Rashomon when a woman was violated and there were three or four different versions of those who were present. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">Each had a different version, then you begin to take the so called holy scriptures, including the epistles, with a grain of salt because unless every word had been guided by the spirit of God and that has to be proven as I know the scientific formula for approving the spirits. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">Whether to what degree we can trust what will be the witness that will be borne, we have fortunately ways of recording testimonies which we didn't have 2,000 years ago or more, and maybe for that reason it will be somewhat better preserved. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">But what hurts more than anything is that what happened to our generation will not be properly understood or acted upon and what hurts even more so is that from what I see the world has not learned and the same thing 18:18: is liable to occur again and again. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">I don't know what else to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">I don't want to say empty phrases. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">This is a picture about six months old 1927 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> of Joseph Kutrzeba born as Josef Arye Fajwiszys about six months old on a bear skin as was then a habit of placing infants on. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">This is my father Professor Israel Fajwiszys approximately 1921 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lwow</span> pre- war Poland, now <span class="COUNTRY">Ukraine</span> , born in 1887 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Yampol</span> which was <span class="REGION">extreme eastern Poland</span> prior to 1939 but at the time of his birth was <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="682">Well, left to right, a chart whose identity I don't know because I got these pictures after the war, next to him I believe is my father's mother or my grandmother whom I never met. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">Standing next to her is my mother Malka Fajwiszys, maiden name Hakman, born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Czer</span> .....? </span><span class="sentence" id="684"><span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="685">It was <span class="COUNTRY">Russia</span> , I believe it was 1902. </span><span class="sentence" id="686">Standing next to her is my father Professor Israel Fajwiszys and then in the woman's lap is my sister Perla age two which was about two years before I was planned and next to her I believe was my mother's sister or cousin, I'm not sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">QUESTION:  When was this picture taken?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">ANSWER:  This picture would have to have been taken in 1925 because my sister was born in 1923 and she looks about two years old here. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">This 1s the foursome family picture 1937 in <span class="REGION">Lodz Poland</span> , left to right, myself, age about nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">Next my sister Perla called by everyone Rella, for short. </span><span class="sentence" id="691">My mother Malka and my father Israel Faywiszys, composer conductor among others the best known song all over the world, called MIkhol Massada? -. </span><span class="sentence" id="692">I was extremely unhappy that day. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">I had been crying for about an hour prior to the picture being taken I remember, and finally my father had to quiet me down because prior to going to the photographer I had been saving money in my little savings box for about a year and my parents decided that I needed a new sweater and they decided to spend all my savings on that and I thought it was very unfair. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">This is my <span class="BUILDING">elementary school</span> private class part of the <span class="BUILDING">Jewish gymnasium</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lodz</span> , fourth grade if I remember with the men standing in the back Grevitz, who taught us geography and the sign in the back says , which means Silesia in Polish. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">Apparently that week he was teaching us about , and that's me in the center age about nine. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">About 1936, '37. </span><span class="sentence" id="697">This was as you can see the lower figures ten two forty-five, which means the 10th of February 1945 almost exactly two months before liberation when I had to go in the city of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Erfurt</span> _ 1n <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> to obtain a new identity pass because my old one was stolen and I had to go to the Gestapo, actually SD (Sicherheitsdienst), which was the security officer of the Gestapo to have a new picture taken with a number as a Polish catholic civilian laborer in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , age not quite 17 I think. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">A few weeks after my liberation by the American troops I was an interpreter with the CIC detachment number 220 part of Patton's third army already wearing an American uniform age still about 17. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">This would have been May of 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">I am on the extreme right standing by the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">This was a group of us <span class="BUILDING">gymnasium</span> kids in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Polish dp camp</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Altenstadt</span> , summer of 1946 I was well 18 I think and myself on the extreme right. </span><span class="sentence" id="702">The time is 1948 in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Munich</span> in front of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">BMW</span> , yes the people who make the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">cars</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="703">The <span class="BUILDING">building</span> which was requisitioned by the American occupying authorities to house the Polish guard company which was an auxiliary military unit which served the U.S. Army in occupation, and this is a review of the Polish troops by two American officers, and on the extreme left which is the Polish commander captain, and I was his adjudant, second lieutenant. </span><span class="sentence" id="704">I'm the next behind him in full uniform and white helmet. </span><span class="sentence"
