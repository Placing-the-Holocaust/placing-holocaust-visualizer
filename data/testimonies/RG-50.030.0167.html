<p><span class="sentence" id="15">QUESTION:  What uh what were your parents like? </span><span class="sentence" id="16">Tell me about your family.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="17">ANSWER:  Uh well, I'm grown up by my grandmother who at the year, at the age of 60 suddenly because of divorces and death got five grandchildren to bring up. </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And one is living here in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Crystal town</span> outside. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">Another lives in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Paris</span> and my sister and I live in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="20">So we are spread a little bit. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">But we had a wonderful time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="22">QUESTION:  What about <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="23">ANSWER:  I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="24">That was an old tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And uh on our <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , uh <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="26">That's , uh south of there in the must be six, sixth year and uh then we go up to <span class="BUILDING">high school</span> and gra... when you can graduate from that <span class="BUILDING">school</span> and go to <span class="BUILDING">college</span> afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="27">QUESTION:  As achild growing up and going to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , uh what were your relationships if any with Jewish students in the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="28">ANSWER:  I tell you I didn't knew they were Jews. . </span><span class="sentence" id="29">Not many but but uh two in my class. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">I didn't know they were Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">They were uh they were my <span class="BUILDING">school</span> pals, nothing else. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">Schoolmates. </span><span class="sentence" id="33">There was no distinction between a Jew and a non-Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="34">They were Danes and in our society there was no, you couldn't say that's a Jew, that's not a Jew.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="35">QUESTION:  As you got older, uh what did you hear about uh if anything in the early thirties, uh mid- thirties, about <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> and about Hitler?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="36">ANSWER:  Uh well, the most I recall that <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> always our enemy number one, and what happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was very very bad for <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">You know when you have the tiger at the <span class="DLF">doorstep</span> you have to be very careful of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="38">There was not the possibility to say quite a lot against him and probably - I can tell you that in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , uh the highest of the three percent who voted for Nazi parti.. the Nazis. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">And we were neighbors so <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> is an old <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> with an old democratic tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="40">Every form of dictatorship whether it is fascism, communism, that's that's not Danish. </span><span class="sentence" id="41">So I don't think - of course we were afraid.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="42">QUESTION:  How as a child, as a young chi... young boy, did you feel the fear and feel the concern?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="43">ANSWER:  No, because we were foolish enough to believe when you have a non-aggression treaty with a man, he will keep it. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">That's the way we live.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="45">QUESTION:  Tell me about the German invasion, for you. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">What was it like? </span><span class="sentence" id="47">When did you know?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="48">ANSWER:  It was really exciting because in the morning I saw the most <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">aircrafts</span> I ever saw. </span><span class="sentence" id="49">You know in in '40 to see an <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">airplane</span> - that was something. </span><span class="sentence" id="50">And one morning there was hundreds going from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> near us to and then going back over <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="51">And while I was had to go to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and I knew nothing about the invasion, the occupation. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">But when I came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , to the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> there, the German soldiers were there and we were shocked. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">Really shocked because we had no idea about it. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">Nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">There was no shooting you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="56">Uh I suppose that thirteen Danish soldiers was killed during the invasion. </span><span class="sentence" id="57">There was, well, we couldn't stand anything against the Hitler war machine. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">We had I suppose ten thousand soldiers in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and well, they put ten times as much through <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> to - his main uh goal was to conquer <span class="COUNTRY">Norway</span> and they did that too you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="59">QUESTION:  What happened to you? </span><span class="sentence" id="60">The year is 1940. </span><span class="sentence" id="61">You're a 14 year old boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="62">What did you do after the - what was your life like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="63">ANSWER:  Well, there was not a big change. </span><span class="sentence" id="64">The only thing happening which was really, you you saw it at the same time, was the black-out. </span><span class="sentence" id="65">From one day to another, you had to black- out. </span><span class="sentence" id="66"><span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> was totally blacked-out. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">And maybe you'll understand how it was later to stand in the blacked-out <span class="DLF">beach</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and look three miles over the straits, the water demarking <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , where the lights were just like pearls on a string. </span><span class="sentence" id="68">It was so fantastic uh but the first thing there was the black-out. </span><span class="sentence" id="69">And then of course there were lack of goods and uh there was no connection with <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> anymore, and our biggest trade partner and uh - but in the beginning the Germans tried to act just like human beings. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">There was what, we should be the model. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">We were the vikings, and we should be - I don't know what he wanted us to be - but there was not, you was not disturbed much by the Germans in the day-to-day, in the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="72">ANSWER:  When did that change for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="73">QUESTION:  Well, for me, you see we were shocked to lost our freedom and every resistance movement first part - I was only 15 when I started - it was to be a messenger boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">Deliver for papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">Illegal papers of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="76">Because the first thing you really noticed 1s that all the news are censored. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">You only hear what the Germans, the Germans wanted you to hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">And therefore it was important to keep the real messages, to give the real news and that was to be duplicated and brought out by boys like me and it 1s of elder people but that was the way we started and it was the beginning to the resistance movement in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , before the , before anything else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  How did you get recruited?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="80">ANSWER:  Well, one of our teachers was uh became rather a famous figure 1n the resistance movement and uh as I went to <span class="BUILDING">school</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> , lived forty kilometers from there, I was a very good guy to have to put from one <span class="NPIP">place</span> to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="81">And then later on it was, we couldn't have all the papers with us on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> , then we duplicated our own papers and brought around.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="82">QUESTION:  Who was your teacher?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="83">ANSWER:  . </span><span class="sentence" id="84">Heard about him.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  So this was going on then for a while?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  For a couple, for one year, two years.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="87">QUESTION:  When did it start to change?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="88">ANSWER:  Well, some of my friends, they went in to the more heavy uh stuff in the resistance movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Started the sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">Started - and that annoyed the Germans very much because because of course small thing that we could do but the Germans wanted to stop the sabotage and uh they demanded that the Danish government who had cooperated very much with the Germans to uh make uh death penalty for sabotage. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">That wouldn't, the Danish government accept and they signed and the Germans took over and that was the really beginning to what's happening later. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">From uh the 29th of August in '43 - that's a very point, the day it happened.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="93">QUESTION:  What were you doing at this time?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="94">ANSWER:  School boy. </span><span class="sentence" id="95">Doing what I've done all the time. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I was not in the sabotage groups. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">We only had the papers and we thought that was enough.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="98">QUESTION:  You have described the change in the beginning of the government. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">Uh how did it become for you more involved in helping the Jews?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="100">ANSWER:  When the uh Jewish New Year, about the first of October, uh we heard that the Germans would arrest the Jews and one day, it was the 2nd or 3rd of October, one of the leaders from the , uh asked me to be there and there, uh to follow, to fetch some Jews from the <span class="BUILDING">station</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Snegerstein</span> to bring them to a special, specially . </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I did that and from there it started.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="102">QUESTION:  How did you feel? </span><span class="sentence" id="103">Talk about that. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">What was that like for you?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">ANSWER:  I thought, these poor devils. </span><span class="sentence" id="106">What are we going to do with them? </span><span class="sentence" id="107">See that, I think that's ridiculous that people are hunted not because they are criminals. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">Our Jewish, the Danish Jews, were no criminals no where. </span><span class="sentence" id="109">They were not in the resistance movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="110">They were hunted because of an insane philosophy that your human values are depending on the shape of you nose and the color of your hair. </span><span class="sentence" id="111">Nonsense. </span><span class="sentence" id="112">That's ridiculous, and we have, you must recall that part about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="113">It was no secret anymore. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">We didn't know the full awful truth about the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> but we knew so much that we could imagine the fate our fellow citizens were meet down there with ; humiliation, starvation, and we have heard about the "final solution", . </span><span class="sentence" id="115">There there was no doubt you had nothing else to do but do what you could in order to avoid that the Germans succeed in their thoughts to the Danish Jews that was our fellow citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="116">QUESTION:  So you had, you had helped once. </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Did you continue helping?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="118">ANSWER:  . </span><span class="sentence" id="119">Then you are hooked. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">And then later on I had to bring them to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> and later on I had to follow them to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> a couple of times and well, you you know it just accelerates a little bit and you do one thing and do another thing and then you can be useful there. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">You could be useful there. </span><span class="sentence" id="122">That's that's the way it goes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">QUESTION:  What did bringing them to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> entail?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="124">ANSWER:  Well, if you - it happened this way in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Snegerstein</span> - that uh two or three or four lived in one <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , was hiding there. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">And then we tried to be quite sure there was no German police, no German soldiers, no Danish uh corroborators, and we brought them down to the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> where the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was waiting. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">We knew exactly when the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> would be there. </span><span class="sentence" id="127">We had some - the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was normally stationed in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and we had every day that point there and there at that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">And then the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> would go in and and we could uh have our passengers aboard. </span><span class="sentence" id="129">But it was very safe because we did everything possible to secure the way from the <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> down to the <span class="DLF">beach</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="130">QUESTION:  What did secure mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="131">ANSWER:  That they were not captured. </span><span class="sentence" id="132">That we were able to see there were no uh on the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Also they had to react in a special way - very silent. </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Uh we had a problem with children sometimes but we have Doctor . </span><span class="sentence" id="135">He gave them injection, the children. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">But he was very afraid sometimes because he said I don't know this patient - how much can I do, but nothing happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="137">It was, they came over all and we never lost a passenger.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="138">QUESTION:  You said you went on some trips. (</span><span class="sentence" id="139">Yes.) </span><span class="sentence" id="140">What was your role? </span><span class="sentence" id="141">What did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="142">ANSWER:  It's, first of all to carry some things and well, some times they ordered me to - I'm a , I've been sailing all my life, so have an order to go from there to there and elsewhere to clean up the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boats</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="143">If you can imagine how the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> is when a dozen of refugees afraid, what they leave after in the the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> was well, I can still recall the smell.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="144">QUESTION:  What did you do when you would get to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> with the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> load of passengers?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="145">ANSWER:  What I would do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="146">QUESTION:  Un-hum. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">What was your role? </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Did you take them any further?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="149">ANSWER:  No no no. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">I uh returned - I only went over by when we had the possibility to go two or three trips a night. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Because as I told you, in the daytime the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> was was situated in in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="152">But sometimes we were very lucky. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German patrol boat</span> is far away. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">Then we could go two and three trips because sometimes it only took twenty minutes to pass the <span class="DLF">strait</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="155">So then I returned back to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  Can you tell me, on the night of October Ist and 2nd when the , of course that was the beginning of the attempt of the great roundup of Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="157">Were you aware that this was a special night and a special trip?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="158">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="159">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">That was of course, that was very high tensions in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in, after the 29th of August. </span><span class="sentence" id="161">Uh we had no government. </span><span class="sentence" id="162">We had uh uh Gestapo rule in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> for the first time and uh the whole thing was very mixed and very unclear. </span><span class="sentence" id="163">The only thing we I remember was that the Germans told all the the ruler, the Gestapo chief, told that now the marshal law was over because the Jews now was taken and the Danish soldier could uh be released. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">They were captured on the 29th of August. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">Uh the Danish soldiers said no, the general said no, they would never have their freedom as a payment for the Jews uh captured. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">But I had no special uh remembrance of what happen... uh of the actions to uh against the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="167">QUESTION:  You were doing this for sometime. (</span><span class="sentence" id="168">Yeah.) </span><span class="sentence" id="169">How long did you continue this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="170">ANSWER:  Well, you must recall that uh the transport groups was not only for uh the Danish Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="171">It was also for the Danish resistance movement. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">So I continued and and then until the end of November when I was over in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and was told not to return because uh some of our groups were taken, arrested, and then I had to stay in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> for the rest of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  Before we get to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , can you describe some of your fellow resistance colleagues? </span><span class="sentence" id="174">You mentioned <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Thormod</span> (ph).</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="201">ANSWER:  It was a quite different <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> because when you live in a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> occupied (cough) and go to another <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> who haven't got the same feelings as we, to them the Germans were not so bad as we thought because they had the relationship with <span class="COUNTRY">Finland</span> and with the Finnish-Russian War and all this. </span><span class="sentence" id="202">And uh sometimes they really didn't understood what happened. </span><span class="sentence" id="203">But after , after there was a change over there. </span><span class="sentence" id="204">But we were treated wonderful and there was, but of course they couldn't have the same opinion of the things as we had. </span><span class="sentence" id="205">But we were treated good and well I I have uh Swedish relatives so I had no problems.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="209">ANSWER:  Well, it was normal life as a soldier. </span><span class="sentence" id="210">I was come in there and was stayed in the Army for one and a half years and that was the normal training. </span><span class="sentence" id="211">Rather tough they said, and I can tell you quite a lot about uh the young Jews were of course there. </span><span class="sentence" id="212">It was young people coming there, trained by Danish officers (cough). </span><span class="sentence" id="213">We had - I think it was very funny - Germany hand grenades so because they they were bought . . . </span><span class="sentence" id="214">we got all our weapons from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> of course, the Swedish government. </span><span class="sentence" id="215">And they had bought lots of German hand grenades. </span><span class="sentence" id="216">Maybe instead of the guns (cough) they were selling to the Germans. </span><span class="sentence" id="217">But uh we had normal training. </span><span class="sentence" id="218">Was a hard life but that's the way it is. </span><span class="sentence" id="219">Your GI's had the same fate. </span><span class="sentence" id="220">They had also to be away for quite a long time. </span><span class="sentence" id="221">That's not - I don't like to be a soldier but (cough) just now when I look back on it it's good but you had to do it that time. </span><span class="sentence" id="222">There was nothing to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="223">That was the .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="225">ANSWER:  Yes, of course.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="226">QUESTION:  What was your relationship with them and what, what did they say about their fellow Jews' predicament, if anything?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="227">ANSWER:  You see, I can't understand this question because there is no difference between a Dane whether he is a Jew or non-Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="228">That's - it's also not - so uh that was the same - they were all Danes - it was not so that the Jews were together in uh the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> and not going out with other guys. </span><span class="sentence" id="229">And of course they were, we don't notice that. </span><span class="sentence" id="230">It was - he was a Dane and so see I really don't understand that question.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="233">ANSWER:  Well, we had sometimes where we, some of our friends went back to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and uh they needed weapons and uh we had the possibility of giving them some weapons to bring back to the resistance movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="234">QUESTION:  How did you get the weapons?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="235">ANSWER:  Well, from friends. </span><span class="sentence" id="236">Now, you see it was possible because we bought weapons in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , but still there I was down there and I was a carrying boy there too. </span><span class="sentence" id="237">That's all.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="238">QUESTION:  You have been instrumental in bringing to the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> with the numbers 0 - 2 on it. </span><span class="sentence" id="239">Uh tell us, you told me before that you uh rode on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> in the course of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="240">Tell me a little bit about that would you please?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="241">ANSWER:  Uh, it was strange because the first <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that we had never had the possibility to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because it was grounded the first - it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">party boat</span> we took - really took, and it was grounded (cough) and destroyed. </span><span class="sentence" id="242">And then we got this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="243">It was bought by (cough) uh the bookbinder from - it was a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> laying in the <span class="DLF">harbor</span> of and uh that was a very good <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and sound <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> built in the beginning of the thirties. </span><span class="sentence" id="244">It was of course a wooden <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> with a good engine and uh it was able to go rather quick eight or nine miles, and that it fora __ <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="245">And when it started, . </span><span class="sentence" id="246">The first night I remember had two or three, no two trips to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> and I think we got ten to twelve passengers every time. </span><span class="sentence" id="247">And then later on we had in October 700 Jews and uh totally I know by this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> brought about 1,400 people from <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="248">And as I told you before I (cough) was, my last trip to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> with this <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="249">QUESTION:  Uh before you got to stay there?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="250">ANSWER:  Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="251">QUESTION:  Uh was that trip anything special? </span><span class="sentence" id="252">Do you remember...
ANSWER:  I can tell you that I never had anything special in all the time, in the couple of trips that I took. </span><span class="sentence" id="253">Normally there was no excitement. </span><span class="sentence" id="254">The excitement was before and when we were able to see north and south, and so there was no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German ships</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="255">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="256">And it was a little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and the radar was not so uh so uh normal on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">German ships</span> at that time and when, if there was a little bit of waves it was very difficult to to find the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="257">But it was not so difficult to go from <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> because as I told you before, if you go from a black <span class="DLF">dock</span> , <span class="NPIP">place</span> into the lights. </span><span class="sentence" id="258">That's easy to find the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="259">It was when we had to go back and find the right <span class="NPIP">place</span> and be met by the right people and not by the wrong people, that was the most exciting part of the of the whole thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="260">You can see that to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> where we were accepted and and welcomed, sometimes I know that uh sailed near the <span class="REGION">Swedish coast</span> because there were <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">Swedish fisher boats</span> took over the the Jewish passengers and brought them to the sho... un to the <span class="DLF">harbors</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="261">And that gave time savings.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="262">QUESTION:  When you describe being in the Danish Brigade in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> , uh would you tell me what it was like please, going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> with that Brigade?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="263">ANSWER:  I say that's fantastic because we thought we were going <span class="BUILDING">home</span> to fight, to throw out to throw out the Germans out of <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and the only shots from that was roses thrown on us, flowers thrown on us. </span><span class="sentence" id="264">It was just, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="265">The Germans surrendered on the 4th and we arrived in , my <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">hometown</span> , on the 5th in the morning. </span><span class="sentence" id="266">And it was you know, it was it was an excitement. </span><span class="sentence" id="267">It was a joy. </span><span class="sentence" id="268">You, I, it will be the best day I ever had you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="269">Free, free and freedom is something you can't describe. </span><span class="sentence" id="270">Everybody happy. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">Let us out of this world.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="272">QUESTION:  What was <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> like at that point?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="273">ANSWER:  Well <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> is my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> and of course it's wonderful. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">That's - you must recall we have a very high in my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="275">We've had the same royal family more than 1,000 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">More than 1,000 years. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">Queen Martha II was a descendent of King who reigned <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> about the 9th century, so we never had a revolution. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">It, the big uh like reforms were made by the people who owned the <span class="REGION">land</span> , the counts. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">It was an absolute sovereign king who gave us the freedom of choosing. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">At that time the other kings were beheaded, but he was beloved. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">That's the difference. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">It's been so that they have been very cleaver. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">They have given the dime before the dollar was I suppose. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">That's uh the way. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">And maybe it also gives some of the explanation why it happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in this way. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">If you realize that when you have a <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> where the tensions are rather low, and other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> in Europe - what did they use when the tension was very high - they tried to divert the tension and then was the easiest way to , kill a few Jews here, kill a few Jews there. </span><span class="sentence" id="287">But we never had that. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">We never had the, it was not necessary for the rulers in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , the people in power to have scapegoats, so therefore we had never had this special class, special group, as scapegoats. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">I think maybe it gives one of the explanations why it happened in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="290">I don't know if that's that's why.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="291">QUESTION:  You were coming back though in 1945? </span><span class="sentence" id="292">Your <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> had been occupied. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">You had a hand at least in getting Jews out and back. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">What was the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> , what was the shape of the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> like? </span><span class="sentence" id="295">What was, what was your life like coming back? </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Was it very different? </span><span class="sentence" id="297">Was the <span class="NPIP">place</span> a mess? </span><span class="sentence" id="298">What...
ANSWER:  Of course there was lack of everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="299">It was a poor <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> in this way that the Germans had taken everything and paid with uh uh German marcs and there was no money, no value and we had to start from scratch. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">But end of forty... '45, '46, '47, there was, everything was progress. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And there was rather uh optimistic mood and later on I can tell you that , thanks to the , thanks to all what happened in the world, and uh it was not difficult, no no, to go back, no.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="302">QUESTION:  You, what did you do?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="303">ANSWER:  Well, I started my education. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">I started to be a business man. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">I had, then I stayed some times in <span class="COUNTRY">England</span> , sometimes uh in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> in order to go into business. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">In '49 I started in a family company and uh stayed there - was uh general manager very soon and started my own company in '81. </span><span class="sentence" id="307">Rather old but age is nothing to me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="308">QUESTION:  Go back to '45 if you would. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">The, you were still a young man coming back. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">Were you, did you have any kind of reunion or meet with any more of the club?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="311">ANSWER:  Oh well well so, I'm meeting them every time because uh uh they grow old and they were so much older than I, we had - it was so that the old parts of the club, they met once a month - the first Wednesday in the month they had a meeting and done that for years but now two or three passed away and now they are using me as the last uh what do you say - I am the guy that brings it together.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="312">QUESTION:  When you came back in '45 uh were you involved in helping Jews get re-settled back in their <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Were you into that at all?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="315">That was not necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="316">Their <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> were there. </span><span class="sentence" id="317">Was kept. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">The, I haven't heard of anybody who couldn't move into the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> he left in in October of '43. </span><span class="sentence" id="319">It was looked after by the neighbors of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">So I, that shouldn't be a problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">There was no need to help there. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">They kept their wages when they were in, from their positions and their jobs were held for them and . . </span><span class="sentence" id="323">I don't think there were any problems there for the Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">Neither for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="325">We came back and that was all where we left there. </span><span class="sentence" id="326">The only people who suffered was the people coming from the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="327">The Danish Jews, the Danish resistance movement people and uh - they had a hard time.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="328">QUESTION:  Tell me about that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="329">ANSWER:  Well, you know that uh the Danish Jews in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> and some of the Danish resistance movement people had better time than others because we had no government but we had the health authorities who went down to to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Theresienstadt</span> for example and of course knew that it was pretend things that they did. </span><span class="sentence" id="330">They painted up the ruins to to show it's better than it was. </span><span class="sentence" id="331">But they had their gift passes every month. </span><span class="sentence" id="332">Uh the Danish, I really think that the people in the, the Danish in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camps</span> had a feeling that people back <span class="BUILDING">home</span> cared and maybe that saved some lives. </span><span class="sentence" id="333">Uh but of course they, the starvation was very very hard. </span><span class="sentence" id="334">And quite a lot of the Danish resistance people came back just like musselmen, you know, without flesh on their body. </span><span class="sentence" id="335">It was ridiculous and it was not so bad when they recovered, but now later they have psychology problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="336">They, it it must be impossible to to recover completely after a time like that in in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Buchenwald</span> , in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Dachau</span> , where ever they was. </span><span class="sentence" id="337">But I think of big importance was that from the Danish Red Cross there was sent this gift passes every month and many of the Danish uh <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> prisoners they survived because of this. </span><span class="sentence" id="338">And also the Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="339">QUESTION:  You talked a lot about what you did and what was going on. </span><span class="sentence" id="340">But can you tell me a little bit about why you did what you did? </span><span class="sentence" id="341">Why were you involved in helping Jews or helping anybody?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="342">ANSWER:  Well uh I don't understand the the question because - could you - you couldn't let people in in need down. </span><span class="sentence" id="343">You can't turn your back to people who need your help. </span><span class="sentence" id="344">There must be some sort of decency in a man's life and I wouldn't have been decent to turn the back to people in need. </span><span class="sentence" id="345">So there's no question uh of why or why not. </span><span class="sentence" id="346">You just did. </span><span class="sentence" id="347">That's the way you're brought up. </span><span class="sentence" id="348">That's the way of the tradition in in my <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="349">You help of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="350">And therefore I don't think it's - I - could you have retained your self-respect if you, knew what these people would suffer and said no. </span><span class="sentence" id="351">Not likely. </span><span class="sentence" id="352">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="353">No way. </span><span class="sentence" id="354">So that's not a problem of of - you just have to do it. </span><span class="sentence" id="355">And nothing else.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="356">QUESTION: None
ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="357">I think I had yes, well, I think it was a time I understand when decency as, was unique. </span><span class="sentence" id="358">I hope we will have a world where decency will be the rule and not the exception.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="359">QUESTION:  Thank you. </span><span class="sentence" id="360">Thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="361">I want you to know something. </span><span class="sentence" id="362">I deliberately asked the questions that I did about Jews hoping that I would get you to say some of the answers that in fact I got. </span><span class="sentence" id="363">It matters. </span><span class="sentence" id="364">Uh, there has been, there, you know, you all from <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> have all heard this before, and you all still look at us with this same blank look as if you're, you know, we're out of our minds. . .</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="367">QUESTION:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="368">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="369">It's clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="370">It's clear. </span><span class="sentence" id="371">Isn't it. </span><span class="sentence" id="372">We have had so many Jews sit here from other <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> - the tape is still rolling - who have told us on the one hand horrible stories of where people not only did not help but who made certain that they would not get out alive or attempted to. </span><span class="sentence" id="373">Uh and have repeated this in such quantities, that the few isolated acts of help from people from <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> or <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> or from where ever stand out as single instances. </span><span class="sentence" id="374">What all of you from <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> are telling me 1s something very different and it is something I think that the world still does not understand was going on.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="375">ANSWER:  Well, you must recall that uh the Jewish in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> got their Danish citizenship in 1814. </span><span class="sentence" id="376">In, and already, they started in the 17th century to go to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="377">You know that was the age of reason. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">I think that's very good because then they were accepted there. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">In 1814 they got, I think it was 1814, uh citizens' rights. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">They were Danes. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">In 1849 they had fully political rights when we had our new constitution. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Uh the Jews were just the Roman Catholics. </span><span class="sentence" id="383">A religious minority. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">That's the only difference and that could be a good thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">Then they shouldn't pay tribute to the <span class="BUILDING">Danish church</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="386">Uh uh we have to do it but they can use it to their own <span class="BUILDING">congregations</span> of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">But you must recall that the Jewish influence in the Danish culture has been rather big. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">I can mention that one of the most played uh plays on the <span class="BUILDING">Theater</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Copenhagen</span> is "Wood Behind the <span class="DLF">Walls</span> ," by Thompson (ph) and the famous <span class="BUILDING">Danish high school</span> , you know, the <span class="BUILDING">High School</span> - it was one, two or three of the founders of the family tree (ph) was Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">Their father was a rabbi but one of the sons converted to to Christianity and, but they was there. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">The you have heard about, the , the which was a very big family in culture and but there was never Yiddish literature in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="391">They all wrote Danish. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">It means that you see therefore that is not Jewish literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">That is Danish literature. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">Maybe you understand why that we we are not able to understand this to try to try to separate Jews from Danes. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And that that may be one of the reasons why there was not this, they were not a special group. </span><span class="sentence" id="396">They never lived in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">ghettos</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="397">And they were I think that the Jews integrated into the Danish society so quick so there was no problem. </span><span class="sentence" id="398">I know that in - I don't know whether it was the late 30's when we had some people from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> and were agriculture uh scheme in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , Jewish from <span class="COUNTRY">Austria</span> , young Jews. </span><span class="sentence" id="399">Even they went into the Danish society very soon. </span><span class="sentence" id="400">One of my wife's and I best friends, Mr. Phillips (ph), he's still speaking a little bit Austrian. </span><span class="sentence" id="401">He came in '38. </span><span class="sentence" id="402">There's one word he never learned to say in Danish. </span><span class="sentence" id="403">But he came in '38 as in the scheme. </span><span class="sentence" id="404">That was the only way to get an visa to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="405">That was the only possibility to get into <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="406">And uh he still tells about this. </span><span class="sentence" id="407">He was not a farmer but OK, he started fair enough in a <span class="DLF">farm</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> and stayed there. </span><span class="sentence" id="408">Now he's just retired. </span><span class="sentence" id="409">He w as director for uh what you call it - book publisher. </span><span class="sentence" id="410">But he's Danish. </span><span class="sentence" id="411">He's Danish. </span><span class="sentence" id="412">And uh therefore there's there is no difference and that's what I want to point out. </span><span class="sentence" id="413">That all these things, that is nonsense to us to talk about a special group of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="414">QUESTION:  Will you take a minute as long as we have the tape and talk specifically about the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> "0 2" for the <span class="BUILDING">Museum</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="415">Um, it would be good to have it on tape. </span><span class="sentence" id="416">Tell me what you know of it's history.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="417">ANSWER:  Well, you see, I've heard a bit . </span><span class="sentence" id="418">| know that it was built in the beginning of the 1830's, early '30's (ph). </span><span class="sentence" id="419">I know that it was uh had it in the start in ; It was bought by uh by uh and later on I know we have had some papers uh telling the owners. </span><span class="sentence" id="420">For instance, Thormod Larson, he bought it just after the war and had it for five, six years, and uh he he called it the "Con Man" because it has made the Germans to last for so long a time. </span><span class="sentence" id="421">And when we discovered it again the name was "Sunshine" and I really think that was a wonderful name to give a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="422">And she is an old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , but she has been good. </span><span class="sentence" id="423">It was a good tool for us. </span><span class="sentence" id="424">She was fair. </span><span class="sentence" id="425">There was never, so far as I recall, one incident where the motor stopped, the engine stopped. </span><span class="sentence" id="426">I think that is also one of the things which - we were very fond of her. </span><span class="sentence" id="427">But uh I saw the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> the last time when Harbor uh, no in in <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> when I when I left it in November '43 and then I saw it again now in the in the Spring here this year when uh asked us to find the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> and we were quite sure it's the same <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> because uh for so long a time uh recognized it and everybody said yes, but that's the old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> that the bookbinder used. </span><span class="sentence" id="428">So, she is an old <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="429">She needs repair, but uh OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="430">I'm very proud to be with her and I think it's wonderful to see her in something valuable for many people. </span><span class="sentence" id="431">And I can tell you as I said when I left <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harbor</span> here in some months ago, before going to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Washington</span> , that we had so many memories, all of us, to that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> but uh it's good that somebody will keep her for uS.
QUESTION:  One of the things that I neglected to ask you when we were on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> 1s, can you describe a trip over on that <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="432">What was it like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="433">ANSWER:  Well, in the start of the mess you know, to put people who had never been in a in a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> before, coming with everything they could have and afraid, first to calm them down. </span><span class="sentence" id="434">And then yourself excited and then suddenly you go out in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">sea</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="435">It's a little bit wavy there, and people are very silent, very very silent. </span><span class="sentence" id="436">And you smell the the fear. </span><span class="sentence" id="437">We knew, we were not in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> because we stood in the in the back, but we knew at that time when we left, however, we would return. </span><span class="sentence" id="438">And we were positively sure that we would go over to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> without problems. </span><span class="sentence" id="439">And, but first out, well then you have nothing else to do - just sail and be calm. </span><span class="sentence" id="440">But the people down there was not able to see anything because they have to stay in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="441">They had a much worse situation than we who could see. </span><span class="sentence" id="442">So it was easier to stand on the open <span class="INT_SPACE">deck</span> than sit in the <span class="INT_SPACE">cabin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="443">But normally as I said, there was no special experiences. </span><span class="sentence" id="444">It was only you go from here, you go over there and you will be there in so and so long time and maybe you'll be a little bit seasick. </span><span class="sentence" id="445">Uh, and anyway we we hoped the weather should be rough. </span><span class="sentence" id="446">It was easier for us to go over because they were, people, the Germans would never see us. </span><span class="sentence" id="447">But there was never an, you see episodes or - it was rather smooth sailing most of the time and as I told you before, we never lost a passenger. </span><span class="sentence" id="448">That indicates also that it's been smooth sailing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="449">QUESTION:  Thank you, thank you very much. </span><span class="sentence" id="450">TECHNICAL CONVERSATION End of Tape #1 Tape #2
QUESTION:  Alright. </span><span class="sentence" id="451">Now we're back on camera. </span><span class="sentence" id="452">Tell me, uh this trip that was different from some of the others and your system?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="453">ANSWER:  We have a system and saying when we return to <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> , if a red light go in; if there's a green light stay away. </span><span class="sentence" id="454">But one day there was no lights and but we took the chance and uh there was no one on the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">beach</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="455">There was no problem at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="456">OK. </span><span class="sentence" id="457">Sometimes it's human to fail and somebody had forgotten to put the light on, but uh everything ended happily.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="458">QUESTION:  What was it like going in with no lights? </span><span class="sentence" id="459">How did you feel?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="460">ANSWER:  Scared. </span><span class="sentence" id="461">But uh send a prayer upwards. </span><span class="sentence" id="462">At that time that was one of the last uh chance for the Jewish refugees but we were so used to uh this procedure that normally it was calm and it choose to be the same thing now. </span><span class="sentence" id="463">There was no problem at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="464">Only that one had forgotten to do what he had to do. </span><span class="sentence" id="465">But. . .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="466">QUESTION:  How did your captain find his way in without lights?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="467">ANSWER:  Well, we have in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> uh pilots of course, but then we had people which we called "men who knows" and that's people who know that exactly part of the the <span class="DLF">border</span> , of the of the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> and uh it's so in <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> in the straits that the <span class="DLF">sand reefs</span> , there are some <span class="DLF">sand reefs</span> , that they are shifting every year. </span><span class="sentence" id="468">But if you know them you can go from one <span class="DLF">reef</span> through a <span class="DLF">hole</span> into another and then you should be a man who knows the way to do it all as people they would drown. </span><span class="sentence" id="469">And uh the captain knew the thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="470">He knew every inch of the uh <span class="DLF">beach</span> and the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">shore</span> <span class="NPIP">outside</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="471">It's interesting.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="472">QUESTION:  You're going in. </span><span class="sentence" id="473">Your lights had failed. </span><span class="sentence" id="474">Your signals had failed. </span><span class="sentence" id="475">If you were caught, did you have guns to defend yourself?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="476">ANSWER:  No. </span><span class="sentence" id="477">We never had a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="478">We don't think it could help anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="479">Uh we couldn't resist uh a German patrol and we had also the security of our passengers to think of. </span><span class="sentence" id="480">So we never had a gun. </span><span class="sentence" id="481">It was a gunless army. . </span><span class="sentence" id="482">I think that that shows that sometimes you can win victory without arms. </span><span class="sentence" id="483">I think that's important.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="484">QUESTION:  You mentioned earlier too that being without guns, that would get you a different sentence than if you had guns if you were caught?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="485">ANSWER:  Yes, in that time there would be, if you were caught with a gun, you had the risk to have the death penalty. </span><span class="sentence" id="486">Otherwise you will shot, maybe shot at sight, but uh if you were caught without guns and then you'll get a long term death penalty, be sent to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">concentration camp</span> but OK, there was a very much better chance, and at that time uh we, the most of the Danish uh resistance movement caught would be sent uh to a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">camp</span> just north of the German<span class="DLF">-Danish border</span> where the conditions were some better, oh no, much better than in a, the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">German concentration camps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="487">So there was really difference if you were taken with guns, explosives - then that would be a death penalty, but we had no use of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="488">We shouldn't catch fish with the guns.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="489">QUESTION:  When you were going in, and the signals had failed, did your passengers know about this?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="490">ANSWER:  No, there was no passengers then. </span><span class="sentence" id="491">We were alone. </span><span class="sentence" id="492">We were on the way in after coming from <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="493">No, there were no <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passengers</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="494">QUESTION:  Uh, let's go back a minute and describe going out again from <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="495">Can you describe for me the reactions of some of your passengers on on one of your <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">trips</span> ? </span><span class="sentence" id="496">Describe for me the people on the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> , how they reacted.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="497">ANSWER:  Well, I really think they reacted what everybody can expect. </span><span class="sentence" id="498">Somebody are calm. </span><span class="sentence" id="499">Somebody are very uneasy. </span><span class="sentence" id="500">Some have children with them and they had a double responsibility. </span><span class="sentence" id="501">They are much more afraid and but normally, and I know it from uh and Thormod Larson who have done it many many times, they said that it was remarkable peace, remarkable calm on the most, of the, from the side of the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">passengers</span> most time. </span><span class="sentence" id="502">There was very seldom that some of the passengers would do anything. </span><span class="sentence" id="503">Because they understand that's their last chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="504">And that was the last attempt in their uh way from <span class="COUNTRY">Denmark</span> to <span class="COUNTRY">Sweden</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="505">And I really think they were very calm in the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> also when we started. </span><span class="sentence" id="506">And very much joy there too when when we said now we're on the right side of the strait. </span><span class="sentence" id="507">That was a relief and that, that was in my -I understood it. </span><span class="sentence" id="508">I understood it. </span><span class="sentence" id="509">But uh there was never the disorder or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="510">No. </span><span class="sentence" id="511">But some of them, they had I suppose a out. </span><span class="sentence" id="512">And maybe also to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">boat</span> .</span></p>
