<p><span class="sentence" id="5">ANSWER:  Yeah, Lachmann, it’s a double name. </span><span class="sentence" id="6">Lachmann is my father’s name, Mosse is my mother’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="7">And -- and my father married into the business, 1t was quite common. </span><span class="sentence" id="8">That is to say my grandfather Mosse founded the newspaper, business of newspaper advertising, and my father married into it, and then took my mother’s name. </span><span class="sentence" id="9">So it’s Lachmann Mosse, really. </span><span class="sentence" id="10">But when I came to <span class="COUNTRY">America</span> , I abbreviated the Lachmann to an L, and took Mosse, ‘cause I thought that was more comprehensible.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="11">QUESTION:  Can you tell us something about your -- your family -- the history of your family? </span><span class="sentence" id="12">Can you characterize what your family was like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="13">ANSWER:  Don’t quite know how to characterize it. </span><span class="sentence" id="14">It’s a very typical German Jewish story. </span><span class="sentence" id="15">They came, with some exceptions, from the east, from -- from the <span class="REGION">region</span> between <span class="COUNTRY">Poland</span> and <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="16">And on both sides, the Lachmann and the <span class="REGION">Mosse side</span> , the -- towards 1860, the sons emigrated to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="17">It was common, too, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> was becoming the center, yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="18">And there they founded a business, I mean a business [indecipherable] my grandfather on the <span class="REGION">Lachmann side</span> , to start with that first. </span><span class="sentence" id="19">My grandfather Lachmann side was a very notable grain dealer, yes, who played some role in German history, in fact, because in the Franco-Prussian war, the army -- nobody knew where the French army was that you wanted to fight, and as a grain dealer, he became sort of the, how would you say, the intelligence man for Bismarck, and the German army, yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="20">And he was offered nobility, which was very rare for a Jew. </span><span class="sentence" id="21">But he refused it. </span><span class="sentence" id="22">Like my other grandfather refused it too. </span><span class="sentence" id="23">These people were good liberals, the aristocracy was not -- was not something they desired. </span><span class="sentence" id="24">So, and then the grandfathers were the great thing, and then my father was his grandson, of this Salomon Lachmann, who was the notable grain dealer, and so on, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="25">And on the other <span class="NPIP">side</span> , as of course become more famous through the years, because my grandfather Mosse, who came from a small <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">village</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Posen</span> , called <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Greiz</span> , came to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , and went into the -- went into the advertising, so to speak, yes, what was then 1850’s. </span><span class="sentence" id="26">And in the 1860’s he had the idea of having an advertising agency where you could advertise not just for one paper, but for all papers. </span><span class="sentence" id="27">That was quite new something then, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="28">And that’s what was the basis of what came after, for what came after was in 1867, the founding of the Berliner Tageblatt which -- and then other newspapers publishing the address book for <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , yes, and the matters of this nature. </span><span class="sentence" id="29">And this publishing empire, you could really call it, he found it on the business of the advertising. </span><span class="sentence" id="30">that was the basis. </span><span class="sentence" id="31">And he had no children, only my mother. </span><span class="sentence" id="32">So my father married into the business, and when my grandfather died in 1920, he became the head of this business.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="33">QUESTION:  What was your chi -- excuse me, what was your childhood like?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="34">ANSWER:  Well, I grew up in a luxury that I suppose seemed normal to me then, but today seems to me entirely un-normal, yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="35">We had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">L</span> , and an <span class="DLF">estate</span> in ...-- about 45 minutes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="36">And other <span class="DLF">estates</span> , but that’s the important one: 45 minutes from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="37">And I spent my time between these two, <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and the <span class="DLF">estate</span> , yes, until I went to <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="38">And in these -- in the -- in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> and in the <span class="DLF">estates</span> , of course, there were servants, usually a couple, butler and cook, you know, kitchen maid. </span><span class="sentence" id="39">My father once in our <span class="BUILDING">Berlin house</span> , met a girl on the <span class="DLF">stairs</span> and said, “What are you doing here?” </span><span class="sentence" id="40">She said, “I am the kitchen maid.” </span><span class="sentence" id="41">Of course, he didn’t know who these people were. </span><span class="sentence" id="42">And -- you know, and other kinds of maids, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="43">And then, of course, as children, we [indecipherable] had governesses. </span><span class="sentence" id="44">First we had a nursemaid, and then we had governesses, and the governess were chosen by language. </span><span class="sentence" id="45">My first governesses were all French, French ladies. </span><span class="sentence" id="46">They didn’t last long with me, ‘cause I was very naughty. </span><span class="sentence" id="47">But they were French ladies, and then came an English lady. </span><span class="sentence" id="48">So I learned French first, and English then.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="49">QUESTION:  You were naughty, what does that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="50">ANSWER:  Well, I don’t know, I -- I suppose I made her life very unpleasant. </span><span class="sentence" id="51">They were all French ladies of a conservative cast. </span><span class="sentence" id="52">Until I was fairly old I thought French was -- <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> was giv -- governed by kings, because of these ladies I had, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="53">So yes, it was a luxury. </span><span class="sentence" id="54">I had my own <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> and driver. </span><span class="sentence" id="55">Then eventually in our <span class="REGION">estate</span> , I had my own little <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> which -- which I drove around the <span class="DLF">park</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="56">QUESTION:  You had a brother and a sister?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="57">ANSWER:  Yes, indeed. </span><span class="sentence" id="58">They’re older than I was, much older. </span><span class="sentence" id="59">Seven years -- five and seven years older.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="64">QUESTION:  Were you close?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="65">ANSWER:  Well, the age difference is too big. </span><span class="sentence" id="66">My brother died very early, in 1958. </span><span class="sentence" id="67">But with my sister I was -- I was close, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="68">QUESTION:  What about your relationship with your -- with your parents, since you were 1n some way raised by them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="69">ANSWER:  Well, we really didn’t have much relationship with our parents. </span><span class="sentence" id="70">My parents were in public life in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , through what they occupied, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="71">So they were always going, or -- going out, or other things, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="72">One’s immediate relationships were with one’s governess. </span><span class="sentence" id="73">And then when I was 10, I was sent to <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , and from then on I was in <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> from the age of 10, to the age of 18. </span><span class="sentence" id="74">18 - 19, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="75">So you didn’t have close relations with your parents; no, not really.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="76">QUESTION:  What was <span class="BUILDING">school</span> like for you before you went off to <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , where did you go --
ANSWER:  Ihave very dim memories of that, of <span class="BUILDING">pre-school</span> , as we would say. </span><span class="sentence" id="77">Very dim. </span><span class="sentence" id="78">Frau Wunderlich was the name of it, and I’ve -- I’ve hardly any memories of it, I can’t quite tell you why.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="79">QUESTION:  Do you have memories of being in your <span class="BUILDING">house</span> during that period, even without [indecipherable |
ANSWER:   Ohyes, I have memories of being in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , yes, but not of this <span class="BUILDING">school</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="80">I mean, that’s where I learned to read and write after all, but I have umf -- I don’t know, it’s just blotted out.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="83">QUESTION:  -- how old were you, 10?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="84">ANSWER:  10.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="85">QUESTION:  And where did you go?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="86">ANSWER:  That was a very famous German school, one of the most famous <span class="BUILDING">boarding schools</span> in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="87">My father had a -- a friend, a friend -- or friend 1s said too much, a companion, when he grew up in his <span class="BUILDING">high school gymnasium</span> , yes, called Kurt Hahn. </span><span class="sentence" id="88">And Kurt Hahn 1s a fascinating character in his own right. </span><span class="sentence" id="89">Kurt Hahn was -- became secretary to the Prince of Baden, who became chancellor -- interim chancellor. </span><span class="sentence" id="90">And after the first World War, in the <span class="BUILDING">castle</span> of the prince, he founded a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , on the English model, on the English model, which became a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> si -- it’s difficult to say. </span><span class="sentence" id="91">It became a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> -- it’s -- I mean, it’s not difficult to say, it’s just I have to find the right words. </span><span class="sentence" id="92">It became a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> for the aristocracy, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="93">For example, the Duke of Edinburgh went there, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="94">The queen of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="95">I used to dunk her pigtails into ink. </span><span class="sentence" id="96">I mean, the late queen of <span class="COUNTRY">Greece</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="97">Didn’t like her very much as a child. </span><span class="sentence" id="98">And all sorts of yes, royalty, and rich families, but also poor. </span><span class="sentence" id="99">But it’s typical of the atmosphere of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> that the free places, or <span class="BUILDING">scholarship places</span> were reserved for sons and daughters of generals of the first World War, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="100">Or people, officers who’d fallen in the first World War, something like that, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="101">I think that was very typical, though the plus of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was that it was one of a very few, I think the only <span class="BUILDING">German boarding school</span> that was co- educational. </span><span class="sentence" id="102">And that was not on the English model, and that was a great plus, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="103">But otherwise, it’s very strict discipline, as you can well imagine, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="104">And I don’t think the teaching was very good, I don’t think you learned a lot, but your character was built.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="105">QUESTION:  Did you like <span class="BUILDING">school</span> ?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="106">ANSWER:  Yes, I liked <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , because I’m a bully by nature, and did very well. ‘</span><span class="sentence" id="107">Cause in these <span class="BUILDING">boarding schools</span> , if you’re not a bully by nature, you don’t do very well. </span><span class="sentence" id="108">I did very well indeed in the two <span class="BUILDING">boarding schools</span> I went to, ‘cause eventually I went to an <span class="BUILDING">English boarding school</span> , of course, when Hitler came in.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="109">QUESTION:  Explain to me what you mean by if you’re not a bully you don’t do very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="110">ANSWER:  If you’re not a bully you don’t do very well.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="111">QUESTION:  What does that mean?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="112">ANSWER:  Well, if your s -- boys together in a <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , yes, I mean, there’s a lot of bullying, you know, after all, yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="113">And it’s children among themselves, especially young teenagers can be very brutal. </span><span class="sentence" id="114">But all this was controlled by a discipline which I now think, looking back on it, was really excellent and doesn’t exist in this <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="115">For example, from -- from the age of 10 on, yes -- I left it when I was 15, but it existed ‘til the age of 18, you got something called -- if you were especially good -- this was a privilege, you got a training plan, which was a plan on which there was written, have you brushed your teeth, have you done your run in the morning, have you had your cold shower, yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="116">You know? </span><span class="sentence" id="117">Have you cheated today, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="118">And you put a plus and minus whether you did it or not. </span><span class="sentence" id="119">And nobody cheated. </span><span class="sentence" id="120">Was a privilege, nobody cheated. </span><span class="sentence" id="121">And that -- that, I think, makes up for all the deficiencies of the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="122">QUESTION:  Why do you think that was so, that nobody cheated?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="123">ANSWER:  — It was just in the atmosphere, it was a privilege, it wouldn’t have occurred to anybody to cheat. </span><span class="sentence" id="124">It was not done. </span><span class="sentence" id="125">The best way of putting it: 1t was simply not done. </span><span class="sentence" id="126">And that sort of training is totally absent in American education, unfortunately.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="127">QUESTION:  George, growing up in -- in such a <span class="BUILDING">household</span> , with parents who are, in a real sense, public figures, what does that mean about who you meet, who comes into the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , what was --
ANSWER:  Well, you met interesting people. </span><span class="sentence" id="128">Of course I was much too young to notice interesting people, yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="129">I mean, for example, one day Litvinov, the -- the -- the Russian, first foreign minister, the Bolsheviks, came -- came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , a party or something, and I was allowed to go into the <span class="INT_SPACE">drawing room</span> downstairs, which as a rule I was not, of course, yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="130">And he had on a what you call it, formal dress, yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="131">And I stood in front of him, I’m told, and pointed at him, to the great embarrassment of everybody, and said, “A Bolshevik? </span><span class="sentence" id="132">How come he’s dressed that way?” </span><span class="sentence" id="133">Yes, mostly cause my father, who was not very apt at business, but who had great cultural interests, above all music, mostly musicians came into our <span class="BUILDING">house</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="134">Every Christmas -- you see, part of the daily rhythm was vacations in those days, and the vacations were normed. </span><span class="sentence" id="135">In other words, every winter we went skiing, regardless, every winter. </span><span class="sentence" id="136">Usually to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Saint Moritz</span> , yes, and later on to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Arosa</span> , but every winter we went skiing, and every summer we had a <span class="BUILDING">house</span> in the <span class="ENV_FEATURES">Alps</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="137">So, this was the rhythm. </span><span class="sentence" id="138">But the Christmases, for example, we always spent with a -- the most famous German conductor, I suppose, almost, of the century, called Fuertwangler. </span><span class="sentence" id="139">With the Fuertwanglers we spent the Christmas. </span><span class="sentence" id="140">He didn’t behave very well after 1933, that’s another story. </span><span class="sentence" id="141">But we spent Christmas at <span class="BUILDING">Fuertwanglers</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="142">And there were always people from the musical world, and sometimes from the theater world, who came to the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , but I was too young, I wasn’t allowed to be present, you know.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="143">QUESTION:  Did they also, the musi -- the musicians come and play concerts and --
ANSWER:  Yes, because in our <span class="BUILDING">Berlin house</span> there was a <span class="BUILDING">concert hall</span> built on, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="144">Big <span class="INT_SPACE">room</span> where they played. </span><span class="sentence" id="145">Rubinstein played, and so that I was allowed to go and hear. </span><span class="sentence" id="146">Rubinstein played and all sorts of people played, because my father was a Hubermann above all, my father gave the first violin to Hubermann. </span><span class="sentence" id="147">So, Hubermann played and so on, yes, yes, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="148">Very, very musical household, but there were also other things. </span><span class="sentence" id="149">My grandmother founded, for example, what we would call in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> for wayward girls, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="150">And this became a society [indecipherable] society women. </span><span class="sentence" id="151">Every woman adopted one of these <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> for wayward girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="152">And my mother was the president of it. </span><span class="sentence" id="153">So they met, of course, in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , these society women, and the <span class="BUILDING">home</span> for wayward girls. </span><span class="sentence" id="154">I don’t know what they mean by wayward girls, to this day I can’t tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="155">But that’s what it was, yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="156">QUESTION:  Was this typical, this philanthropic [indecipherable]
ANSWER:  Obhyes, yes, yes, very much, yes, yes, yes, every -- everybody had his philanthropy in these very wealthy <span class="BUILDING">houses</span> -- <span class="BUILDING">homes</span> , yes, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="157">QUESTION:  What was that about? </span><span class="sentence" id="158">I mean, it was -- was -- why was it so typical, do you think?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="159">ANSWER:  Well, that was just a thing you did, I mean, you -- you -- you -- especially if you were Jewish, it’s part of assimilation for the Jews, yes, to be part -- for example, my grandfather founded a -- an <span class="BUILDING">orphanage</span> , big <span class="BUILDING">Berlin orphanage</span> , still stands, a <span class="BUILDING">Berlin orphanage</span> , you know, for Jewish and Christian children, you did that sort of thing. </span><span class="sentence" id="160">That was part of being integrated into the society, if you like, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="161">QUESTION:   In--1n what sense was your family Jewish? </span><span class="sentence" id="162">Was there any religious association?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="163">ANSWER:   Obhyyes, both my grandfather and father were very involved with the Jewish reform. </span><span class="sentence" id="164">Now Jewish reform in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> was a complete reform, much more than anything you know about today, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="165">And they were very involved with it indeed, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="166">Both, my grandfather Mosse, and my father. </span><span class="sentence" id="167">And they did in our <span class="REGION">estate</span> always, the synagogue youth clubs and things came out, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="168">QUESTION:  So were you involved in that also?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="169">ANSWER:  No, no, I was in <span class="BUILDING">boarding school</span> , no. </span><span class="sentence" id="170">No, no, uh-uh.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="171">QUESTION:  Did you one day a --
ANSWER:  Iwas -- I was kicked out of the -- of what we called <span class="BUILDING">Sunday school</span> , cause it met on Sunday, cause I was so naughty. </span><span class="sentence" id="172">Yes, an effort was made to send me to <span class="BUILDING">religious school</span> , and it didn’t last long.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="173">QUESTION:  Did you once express to your father an interest in becoming a rabbi?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="174">ANSWER:  Yes, I did. </span><span class="sentence" id="175">I don’t really know why. </span><span class="sentence" id="176">I did express that interest, and -- I don’t know what got into me. </span><span class="sentence" id="177">But anyway, my father had a very good cure, he thought, and he was right. </span><span class="sentence" id="178">He put me into a <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , into our <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">car</span> , and a -- said to the chauffeur to drive to the Scheunenviertel, that’s the Jewish quarter of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="179">And there he took me and said -- and showed me these pious Jews, you know, with the peyes, and dark, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="180">And said, “Do you want to be like them?” </span><span class="sentence" id="181">And I said, “Of course not.” </span><span class="sentence" id="182">So that was that.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="268">QUESTION:  Why were you last?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="269">ANSWER:  Well, at -- first of all I was last because I was bad, generally, and I had to do -- what do you call it, after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , what do you call it if you have to stay after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , yeah? </span><span class="sentence" id="270">I had to stay after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , and my parents and everybody was out. </span><span class="sentence" id="271">And Hitler made a decree that I think -- I -- I always get that wrong, but let’s say towards the first of February or something, you -- not the first of February, the 12 of February, you had to have a permit to leave <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="272">That was unprecedented, that never been before, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="273">And I wouldn’t have gotten it, because the Nazis would have taken me hostage for the family, and the newspapers, and everything, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="274">So my parents pleaded, but the headmistress of my <span class="BUILDING">pre-school</span> -- I was, of course, in <span class="BUILDING">pre-school</span> --who was a real Protestant type, a Vermont Protestant type, but a real Prussian Protestant type, said no, that I must stay till I have finished my duty after <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="275">So, the result of that is -- no, I mean she was a wonderful woman, she got into — Fraeulein Koeppen was her name, she got into <span class="BUILDING">prison</span> eventually because she refused to teach “Mein Kampf’, but she refused to teach “Mein Kampf” in German class, because it was bad German, not because we -- you know, it was bad German. </span><span class="sentence" id="276">It is bad German, yeah, so she was a real -- as you call it, a real -- you know, a real type, as it were. </span><span class="sentence" id="277">So I was late, and the way to leave was via the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> across <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Lake Constance</span> , ‘cause that’s near where the <span class="BUILDING">school</span> was. </span><span class="sentence" id="278">So I came to the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> , and that was the last <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> before this so-called “sichtvermerk,” this permit -- the exit permit, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="279">And there were nothing but Brown Shirts on either side, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="280">And when you had to run through them, as it were, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="281">And -- and it was my luck that just before Hitler had mentioned us, in some way. </span><span class="sentence" id="282">Mosse, Jew press, you know, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="283">So I came there, and I said, well, I’m done for, because all they did 1s hel -- hold me back five minutes and the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ferry</span> would be gone and they had me. </span><span class="sentence" id="284">And indeed, when I showed my passport, they looked at each other and passed it from one SA man to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="285">They didn’t stop me. </span><span class="sentence" id="286">That’s <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="287">It was five minute to 12, not 12. </span><span class="sentence" id="288">So that’s why I’m here today, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="289">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="290">QUESTION:  George, talk a little bit about being liberal Jews, and the importance of that in that -- in that context. </span><span class="sentence" id="291">Because often people talk about anti-Semitism, but not about the political --
ANSWER:  Well, the political orientation of most Jews, German Jews, most Jews in Europe, was a liberal orientation, because they were emancipated in the enlightenment. </span><span class="sentence" id="292">That had given them the chance of emancipation, to become part of the community as it were. </span><span class="sentence" id="293">And this chance they used, and what remained of it was a belief, let us say in -- in -- in processes, not in finished thing -- in other words, in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> -- there’s one other factor perhaps I should explain. </span><span class="sentence" id="294">There is the word “Bildung”, which means -- it’s a German word, essentially European word, which means cultivate your character, cultivate yourself. </span><span class="sentence" id="295">And the assimilation of Jews was facilitated by the idea that everybody could cultivate his own nature, his own character, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="296">Didn’t matter were you Jews and Christians, because this was a process. </span><span class="sentence" id="297">This was not a finished product, like nation or anything else: this was a process. </span><span class="sentence" id="298">Now, this fitted the whole Jewish situation obviously, because that was their way to integration, yes? </span><span class="sentence" id="299">So that you will find, for example in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , yeah, that the Jews supported the small liberal party, which was tiny by 1933, yes, our newspapers, the other Jewish owned newspapers, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="300">Which meant most of the serious press supported the tiny liberal party, when it obviously had no chance. </span><span class="sentence" id="301">And of course, as in a way the fate of the Jews depended not only on tolerance, but also on freedom, economic freedom, and so on, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="302">They didn’t see -- my father, for example, not at all-- what was obvious, that by the 1920’s, the social democrats were the great champions of the Jews in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="303">But they didn’t see it, they still saw the social democratic Marxist rhetoric as an enemy, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="304">So I remember when my sister first voted social democratic. </span><span class="sentence" id="305">That was terrible row in the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> , terrible row. </span><span class="sentence" id="306">And my mother immediately began with the toothbrush, “do you want to share your toothbrush? </span><span class="sentence" id="307">That was her reaction to everything on socialist, you see. </span><span class="sentence" id="308">It was terrible, though. </span><span class="sentence" id="309">Illegitimate children were also mentioned, and God knows why. </span><span class="sentence" id="310">I mean, today it seems ridiculous, but that’s how social democrats were perceived, though they were the real champions of the Jews, not the liberals, not the political liberals in <span class="COUNTRY">Germany</span> , that -- you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="311">But they will remain liberals to the very end, that is the German Jewish tradition, and it’s a very fine tradition. </span><span class="sentence" id="312">In a way you can put it this way, that it were the German Jews who carried the liberal tradition from 1933 through to 1945. </span><span class="sentence" id="313">Who transmitted it.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="314">QUESTION:  Was you sister unusual?</span></p>

ANSWER:  Well, she was more left than social democrat in the end, oh yes, yes, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="318">Was she unusual? </span><span class="sentence" id="319">No, many of the children of these very rich Jews became socialists, of course, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="320">Some became communists, it’s well known, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="321">No, she worked up in the north of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , in the <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Wedding</span> , the working class part, with children at that time in her life. </span><span class="sentence" id="322">And told my father, for example, that working class children already came to -- came to the meetings with little Nazi daggers in their belt, my father should take Hitler seriously. </span><span class="sentence" id="323">My father thought till the last that Hitler belonged in the comic papers -- pages of the newspaper, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="324">After all, that’s what Hitler, you know, helped him so much that everybody undervalued him.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="377">ANSWER:  Imean, they’re -- they’re just -- just a bureaucracy that you can’t imagine. </span><span class="sentence" id="378">And very nasty, because we were mere immigrants, and nothing, nothing, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="379">So that wasn’t a big change, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="380">You had to do that everywhere. </span><span class="sentence" id="381">For example, whenever I went to <span class="COUNTRY">Switzerland</span> to see my sister or brother, I had to -- my father, I -- my father had to deposit a very large sum, to be sure I went out again. </span><span class="sentence" id="382">Do you know? </span><span class="sentence" id="383">The Swiss were the worst, that’s not generally realized. </span><span class="sentence" id="384">The “J” for Jew in your passport, that was a Swiss, not a Nazi idea at all. </span><span class="sentence" id="385">It was a Swiss idea, so they could keep Jews out, yeah. </span><span class="sentence" id="386">That isn’t enough -- emphasized enough, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="387">So I didn’t -- so then we all got different passports, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="388">My sister, because it was very -- she knew how to do things, went- there was one consul in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Naples</span> , Reitling was his name, who gave Jews passports without a ‘J’. </span><span class="sentence" id="389">And she got one. </span><span class="sentence" id="390">And th -- almost the same thing happened to me, I went in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">London</span> to get a new passport without a “J”, you know, and the consular official talked to me and shoved me over surreptitiously, a passport without a “J”. </span><span class="sentence" id="391">You see, there were decent people around, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="392">So for awhile I had a passport, then my brother became a Turk for awhile because we had very good Turkish connections, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="393">And then this German passport expired in a very short time, and my father got the Prime Minister of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Luxemburg</span> to forge his own passport, which I still have, for me, yes, without expiry date, so I traveled for about three years on a Luxemburgian passport, which was embarrassing when I met somebody from <span class="COUNTRY">Luxemburg</span> because I’d never been there, of course, in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="394">And today I keep it in case the Americans are cheeky, I say, me, a Luxemburgian, you know. </span><span class="sentence" id="395">And what I learned from that is you can never have enough passports, believe me, you can never have enough passports.</span></p>

ANSWER:  Oh that, immediately. </span><span class="sentence" id="643">Yeah, once I studied history at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Haverford</span> -- I mean, I was an English major first, but then I switched to history major. </span><span class="sentence" id="644">Then -- immediately -- and I first want to go to <span class="BUILDING">Yale</span> , yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="645">But then I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> because I discovered something in the Harvard catalog -- one has to read college catalogs. </span><span class="sentence" id="646">There is in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> a fellowship called the Holzer Fellowship, which 1s for those who were born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin Charlottenburg</span> , which is a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> -- no, it’s not a <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">suburb</span> , it’s a part of <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="647">And I had to prove that the <span class="DLF">street</span> , the <span class="BUILDING">house</span> -- my <span class="DLF">street</span> was part <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin</span> , part <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin Charlottenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="648">And I had to prove I was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin Charlottenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="649">When I proved that, I had three years tuition and everything, cause no -- there were no other candidates who in that time was born in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Berlin Charlottenburg</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="650">It pays to read college catalogs 1s the answer. </span><span class="sentence" id="651">So -- but I went to <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> because there was a professor I want to study with, Charles Howard Mcllwain. </span><span class="sentence" id="652">I was interested then in English Constitutional history, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="653">And I wrote my thesis on English Constitutional history. </span><span class="sentence" id="654">That was really my field, yes, my interest. </span><span class="sentence" id="655">And that came about because really very little else was taught to begin with 1-in -- in <span class="BUILDING">school</span> , in any case. </span><span class="sentence" id="656">And I -- through Leslie Gilbert and others, I had become deeply involved in English history. </span><span class="sentence" id="657">So that’s why. </span><span class="sentence" id="658">And then I did my thesis with a wonderful man, a great teacher, Charles Howard MclIlwain at <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="659">QUESTION:  Now, you didn’t -- before you finished your degree, you actually started teaching in --
ANSWER:  Yes, that was necessary. </span><span class="sentence" id="660">I -- I wrote, I think, a hundred letters, and got two offers. </span><span class="sentence" id="661">It was very tough after the war, one forgets, it’s not just now. </span><span class="sentence" id="662">Got two offers, one from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">NYU</span> , and one from <span class="REGION">Iowa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="663">And I took the one from <span class="REGION">Iowa</span> -- from <span class="REGION">Iowa</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="664">And was an offer, I think 16 hours teaching at $1,800, or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="665">But you could make a living, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="666">And of course I’d never been in the <span class="REGION">Midwest</span> , and [ll never forget arriving in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iowa City</span> , four in the morning, ‘cause that’s when the Rock Island Rocket, the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">train</span> gets through there, yes, and going to the main <span class="DLF">street</span> , and the main <span class="DLF">street</span> is, as I now know in the Midwest, just tapers off into nothing. </span><span class="sentence" id="667">I started to cry. </span><span class="sentence" id="668">The main <span class="DLF">street</span> tapered off into nothing, there was nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="669">QUESTION:  Did you regret the choice then?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="670">ANSWER:  No, no, no, because <span class="REGION">Iowa</span> had a wonderful thing in those days, absolutely unique. </span><span class="sentence" id="671">It had a dean who was a genius in his way. </span><span class="sentence" id="672">He said, “Now look, we are a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> that’s poor, what can we really be good in?” </span><span class="sentence" id="673">Fine arts. </span><span class="sentence" id="674">So it had an art department which was top, top. </span><span class="sentence" id="675">I still have in my <span class="BUILDING">house</span> pictures by painters who are now famous, ‘cause whenever you gave a party and a painter broke an ashtray, he gave you a picture, you know, pretty good. </span><span class="sentence" id="676">You put the <span class="SPATIAL_OBJ">ashtrays</span> in their way. </span><span class="sentence" id="677">So -- and it had a <span class="BUILDING">theater</span> that was fantastic, British directors, and actors, sometimes Hermione Gingold, and I don’t know what, really absolutely superb, art history superb, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="678">And history was good too, it was a <span class="BUILDING">university</span> in the up. </span><span class="sentence" id="679">But the wonderful thing -- and I was a cultural historian, don’t forget-- the wonderful thing was the whole fine arts scene. </span><span class="sentence" id="680">There was there the famous writer’s workshop, which still exists, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="681">So my colleague for three -- I was there ni -- eight years, and eight or nine years. </span><span class="sentence" id="682">For four of these years, Robert Lowell, the poet, was my colleague, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="683">And his wife, Elizabeth Hardwick. </span><span class="sentence" id="684">Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="685">So, I mean <span class="REGION">Iowa</span> was quite a special <span class="NPIP">place</span> , believe me.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="686">QUESTION:  Now, you said you were -- you were a cultural historian.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="687">ANSWER:  Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="688">QUESTION:  But when you graduate from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Harvard</span> , that’s not the --
ANSWER:  No, that’s not it, it shifted. </span><span class="sentence" id="689">I mean, I was still doing English Constitutional history, but more and more interested in cultural matters. </span><span class="sentence" id="690">This is quite true.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="691">QUESTION:  Is there some reason it comes about, or simply that you start teaching?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="692">ANSWER:  No, it’s simply I -- I taught -- I taught Ren and Ref, Renaissance and Reformation, and I taught English Constitutional history, of course, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="693">And sometimes modern <span class="COUNTRY">Britain</span> , it depended, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="694">And I always taught the freshman course, that was my great plus. </span><span class="sentence" id="695">I learned to teach first in the war, when I was a part of the program which trained occupation troops. </span><span class="sentence" id="696">And I had one regiment that was to occupy <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> , and one that occupied <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="697">And the boys in the Czechosl -- in the one that was to occupy <span class="COUNTRY">Czechoslovakia</span> were very nice. </span><span class="sentence" id="698">But the ones who were to <span class="REGION">occupied France</span> gave me great deal of pressure, ‘cause I thought <span class="COUNTRY">France</span> probably deserved them. </span><span class="sentence" id="699">They were all Marxists, all from <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">New York City</span> , most of them. </span><span class="sentence" id="700">So you can imagine, I had to teach them, my first teaching, that was a challenge. </span><span class="sentence" id="701">That’s how I learned to teach, I’m very grateful for that, it really -- it really was a challenge.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="702">QUESTION:  Where were you doing this teaching?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="703">ANSWER:  In <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iowa city</span> already.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="704">QUESTION:  Oh, that -- that’s where --
ANSWER:  That program was in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iowa city</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="705">I just stayed in <span class="POPULATED_PLACE">Iowa city</span> .</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="706">QUESTION:  So what did you have to teach them?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="707">ANSWER:  How to occupy the <span class="COUNTRY">countries</span> , with the -- the topography, almost everything. </span><span class="sentence" id="708">They were all sent to <span class="COUNTRY">Japan</span> , of course, in the end, the army being the army, yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="709">QUESTION:  You like teaching.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="710">ANSWER:  Yes, very much, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="711">Well, I became very good at lecturing, ‘cause then the veterans came, and we had classes of, let’s say up to a thousand. </span><span class="sentence" id="712">And I was the only person in my whole department who could lecture to a thousand. </span><span class="sentence" id="713">It takes a certain showmanship, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="714">And that I used to get immediate promotion to tenure, of course. </span><span class="sentence" id="715">I remember I met the dean on the <span class="DLF">staircase</span> and I said, “Well, I think I have enough, I'll leave.” “</span><span class="sentence" id="716">Oh no, you mustn’t do that,” he said. </span><span class="sentence" id="717">Then I gave my conditions. </span><span class="sentence" id="718">But I was the only one who could lecture to that many people.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="719">QUESTION:  What kind of research did you start to -- start to do at -- at this time in the late 40’s and early 50’s? </span><span class="sentence" id="720">Were you moving towards --
ANSWER:  No, not yet, this was all red -- Renaissance and Reformation research, yes, mm-hm. </span><span class="sentence" id="721">I did then -- I began in the mid-50’s to do some on antisemi -- one on anti-Semitism, German anti- Semitism. </span><span class="sentence" id="722">I wrote an article, I don’t know, ’58 or something like that. </span><span class="sentence" id="723">That was my first.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="724">QUESTION:  And what did -- what -- the impetus, is there any particular reason why you --
ANSWER:  No, I can’t really tell you. </span><span class="sentence" id="725">Well, there was a particular reason, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="726"><span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> gave me an offer, and I wanted to come to <span class="REGION">Wisconsin</span> , ‘cause it was then one of the best history departments in the <span class="COUNTRY">country</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="727">And the condition was that I teach modern cultural history. </span><span class="sentence" id="728">So I had to work it up, I never had a course in modern history in my life. </span><span class="sentence" id="729">So I had to work it up, obviously, yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="730">So that’s -- that’s how it came.</span></p>

<p><span class="sentence" id="963">ANSWER:  Yes. </span><span class="sentence" id="964">And that’s a pity, because they -- they -- it blinds them to other Jewish things in this century, which have, perhaps, great intellectual value, or carry -- whatever.</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="965">QUESTION:  What do you think it might blind people to, when -- when the Holocaust is overemphasized like that?</span></p>
<p><span class="sentence" id="966">ANSWER:  — It blinds them for one thing to the irony of Jewish history that the Holocaust takes place at the precise moment when you have the greatest success of assimilation in history, namely in the <span class="COUNTRY">United States</span> . </span><span class="sentence" id="967">And it blinds them to the fact of the success of assimilation, rather than the failure.</span></p>

ANSWER:  But you see, I do, because when I lecture, as I did just yesterday, on the first World War or the Holocaust, that’s exactly what I do. </span><span class="sentence" id="1016">I explain the mindset of the perpetrators, which seems to me essential, and the atmosphere in which they grew up, which has to do with the first World War, in which even many of them fought. </span><span class="sentence" id="1017">So there is a continuity here in the minds of the perpetrators. </span><span class="sentence" id="1018">How they regarded mass death, cause the Holocaust is about mass death. </span><span class="sentence" id="1019">So is the first World War. </span><span class="sentence" id="1020">So, how they regarded mass death, and so on. </span><span class="sentence" id="1021">And there is a definite continuity there. </span><span class="sentence" id="1022">Without a certain atmosphere in post-war germ -- post World War I Germany, it would have been quite different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1023">Would have been quite different. </span><span class="sentence" id="1024">These weren’t youngsters who did the killing process, I mean. </span><span class="sentence" id="1025">Maybe they hadn’t fought in the war, but they knew enough about the war, and certainly about post-war Germany, the Weimar Republic, and all that. </span><span class="sentence" id="1026">So again, I don’t think you can explain their motivation without going back. </span><span class="sentence" id="1027">And then one thing brings you to another. </span><span class="sentence" id="1028">You see what I mean?</span></p>
